 Update to the AIAI Community from the organisers  
 Dear Colleagues,  
 On behalf of the 19th AIAI 2023 Organizing and Scientific Committee, it is a real honor and pleasure to welcome all Artificial Intelligence scholars who are looking for a well-established and prestigious forum to communicate and disseminate the innovative advances of their research. It is a fact that AI is continuously digging its way in a vast number of diverse scientific domains. AIAI aims to provide a forum for delegates from both academia and industry, who wish to share pioneer ideas, to get to know each other better and to present their research. Moreover, it aims to offer a deep glimpse into the future and to examine important AI ethical aspects.  
 The Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations  (AIAI) Conference has been held continuously since 2005, under the auspices of the IFIP WG12.5. Through the years, it has evolved to a well-respected and mature event, under the technical and scientific co-sponsorship of the AIAI community. This community comprises of an extended Group of leading scientists, not only from Europe but from all over the globe.  
 The h-index of the AIAI event is as high as 33. This proves the novelty and quality of the presented-published research and its important contribution to the promotion of scientific ideas, algorithms and methods, globally. The fact that the conference Springer Proceedings, have been downloaded more than 2,030,000 times so far, supports the robust impact of the event among the scholars of AI internationally. …[read more]

 About the event The 28th International Conference on Natural Language and Information Systems will be held at the University of Derby, United Kingdom and will be a face to face. https://www.derby.ac.uk/events/latest-events/nldb-2023/   
 Since 1995, the Natural Language to Data Bases (NLDB) conference brings together researchers, industry practitioners, and potential users interested in various applications of Natural Language in the Database and Information Systems field. The term "Information Systems" has to be considered in the broader sense of Information and Communication Systems, including Big Data, Linked Data and Social Networks.  
 The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has recently experienced several exciting developments. In research, these developments have been reflected in the emergence of neural language models (Deep Learning, Word Embeddings, Transformers) and the importance of aspects such as transparency, bias and fairness, a (renewed) interest in various linguistic phenomena, such as in discourse and argumentation mining, and in new problems such as the detection of disinformation and hate speech in social media, as well of mental health disorders that increased during the recent pandemic. Regarding applications, NLP systems have evolved to the point that they now offer real-life, tangible benefits to enterprises. Many of these NLP systems are now considered a de-facto offering in business intelligence suites, such as algorithms for recommender systems and opinion mining/sentiment analysis.  
 It is against this backdrop of recent innovations in NLP and its applications in information systems that the 28th edition of the NLDB conference takes place. We welcome research and industrial contributions, describing novel, previously unpublished works on NLP and its applications across a plethora of topics as described in the Call for Papers.  
 Call for Papers NLDB 2023 invites authors to submit papers for oral or poster presentations on unpublished research that addresses theoretical aspects, algorithms, applications, architectures for applied and integrated NLP, resources for applied NLP, and other aspects of NLP, as well as survey and discussion papers.  
 Authors should follow the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) format and submit their manuscripts as a PDF via Easychair.  
 Important Dates Full paper submission: 14 March 2023 Paper notification: 10 April 2023 Camera-ready deadline: 24 April 2023 Conference: 21 - 23 June 2023

  About ArtsIT 2023   
 The ArtsIT conference brings together a wide array of cross-/inter-/trans-disciplinary researchers, practitioners, artists, and academia to present and discuss the symbiosis between art (in its widest definition) and information technology applied in a variety of distinct fields. Since 2009 ArtsIT has become acknowledged as a leading scientific forum for the dissemination of cutting-edge research results in the intersection between art, science, culture, performing arts, media, and technology. The role of artistic practice using digital media is also to serve as a tool for analysis and critical reflection on how technologies influence our lives, culture, and society. ArtsIT is therefore not only a place to discuss technological progress but also a place to reflect on the impact of art and technology on sustainability, responsibility, and human dignity. Besides the main track, the event also focuses on the advances seen in diverse areas that have significantly contributed to the field in the last years, namely, Digital Musical Interfaces, virtualization and artificial intelligence with special sessions.  
 Campinas is a Brazilian city located in the southeast region of São Paulo State and is situated a few kilometers from the Tropic of Capricorn, which crosses São Paulo State. It is the first Brazilian city to become a metropolis without being a capital, exerting significant national influence. The city is home to several universities, including UNICAMP, the State University of Campinas, ranked among the top five universities in Latin America. In only 57 years, this university has achieved international recognition by fulfilling its mission of building and disseminating knowledge and innovation.  
 This year, ArtsIT is hosted by NICS, the Interdisciplinary Nucleus of Sound Studies, as part of its 40th anniversary. Formed in 1983, NICS’ primary objective is to research different manifestations of sound, in all its aspects and applications, as a source of informational, cognitive, and creative content. The nucleus was founded with a vocation for interdisciplinary research, addressing innovative themes for the time that continue to be updated, including sound pollution, analysis of sounds in Brazilian forests, phonetics of their fauna and native populations, electronic music, and ethnomusicological records.

 Exploring the Theoretical Landscape of BehCreative: Artistic and Therapeutic Possibilities of an Extended Digital Musical Instrument  
  Abstract   
 In the digital age, technology has become ubiquitous in various fields of knowledge, functioning as an extension of the human body – akin to a technological body. Consequently, it acquires ecological validity in our daily lives and offers a path for developing studies rooted in Embodied Cognition. This idea is illustrated by BehCreative, an Extended Digital Musical Instrument (EDMI) introduced and presented in this article. The article delineates the design, mapping and architecture of BehCreative from both musical and cognitive standpoints. Moreover, it explores how these instruments bridge the divide between traditional musical interfaces and immersive technologies, thereby redefining the limits of artistic expression and therapeutic interventions. The article highlights that BehCreative, as a hybrid instrument, holds the potential to facilitate therapeutic recovery and serve as an artistic tool for expressive purposes. Given its hybrid nature, BehCreative presents diverse possibilities for exploring users’ behavioral learning, as evidenced by the results of a mentioned exploratory study. Consequently, it substantiates the hypothesis of being an instrument that warrants examination from an interdisciplinary perspective.

 Adapting the Emobook Life Story Book App for Reminiscence Focused Music Therapy in Dementia Care: An Interdisciplinary Participatory Design Approach  
  Abstract   
 Life Story books are frequently employed to facilitate reminiscence interventions, but their use in music therapy remains limited in the scientific literature. There is a paucity of research detailing the design processes involved in this context. In contemporary music therapy, the effective integration of technology is a significant concern. This paper aims to report on the Participatory Design process used to adapt the Emobook Life Story Book App for a Reminiscence Music Therapy Program for people living with dementia. An interdisciplinary team comprising an interaction designer, a software engineer, a music therapist, and a research assistant engaged in co-design meetings. The interdisciplinary and participatory process yielded four ideas and four lines of action, which evolved iteratively as the work meetings progressed. Points raised by the lines of action were addressed, leading to modifications in the Emobook app and adjustments in the intervention program for seamless integration. Collaborative, interdisciplinary efforts are essential in advancing the incorporation of technology into music therapy practice. This study demonstrates the value of a Participatory Design approach in adapting technology for use in Music Therapy.

 Preliminary Findings from BehCreative: Exploring the Potential of Extended Digital Music Instruments for Music Therapy and Rehabilitation  
  Abstract   
 The usefulness of traditional musical instruments has already been demonstrated in music therapy and rehabilitation. In recent years, virtual reality systems have also been shown to promote good cognitive and motor rehabilitation results. Nevertheless, there are still few studies joining these things. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the application potential of an Extended Digital Musical Instrument (EDMI), BehCreative, in those areas, focusing on its ability to promote engagement, motivation, and confidence among users. For this, Gibson’s concept of affordance to study users’ creative behavior was used. Three healthy subjects participated in this study. Virtual Affordances (VAs) used by users during an exploratory phase and their Motion Development (jerk) were measured, and they answered the Affective Sliders self-assessment questionnaire. The results indicate a positive impact of BehCreative on emotional reactions, physical activities, and creative learning, opening avenues for future research and practical applications in the fields of motor learning and human-computer interaction in music therapy and rehabilitation.

 A Systematic Review of the Technology Available for Data Collection and Assessment in Music Therapy  
  Abstract   
 The lack of standardized tools for assessment in music therapy is a reality that has concerned music therapists for years. Considering technology as one of the advances that have most modified our lives in recent years, this study carries out a systematic review to analyze the technology available for data collection and assessment in music therapy. The databases analyzed were PubMed and Scopus, from 2013 to June 2023. Out of 370 records, only 8 records met the inclusion criteria, showing a strong prevalence in publications in 2022. This review suggests that the technology is increasingly present in music therapy sessions and it is also growing the number of studies worried to find more accurate solutions for data collection and assessment in music therapy. Taking advantage of technological resources for this process seems to be a great opportunity, but the research in this context is insufficient for this moment, so there remains too much work to do.

 Sound Body as Embodied Poetic Interaction  
  Abstract   
 The Nucleo de Dança Redes at the State University of Campinas has been developing multimodal artistic research in mixed reality in an interactive, immersive, dialogical, and in nets. In this article we present some research focus of the group referencing two works “De uma Margem a Outra” and “Jardim das Cartas”. Researchers in the areas of dance, music and audio visual have been raising discussions about an “expanded sound body” that stems from the interaction between movement, sound, music, video and technology in a mixed environment. A body that extends in sound, and an embodied sound in movement in an expanded perspective of the body in “presence” with more complex contours.   
 Another point is in the observation and understanding of the event of multimodal improvisation in a mixed environment as a path and an interactive and connective articulation between the communication agent that participate in the net as an expressive path that is shown in the interactive exploration. Based on interactive practices and on the concept of net, we work methodologically towards a “poetic interaction” in the field of complexity. A fertile ground in which improvisation and composition become coordinated paths for the unfolding of a dance which starts from the connectivity and from the interaction between sound, body movement, image and technology.

 Immersive Dramaturgy. Aesthetic Dance Experiences Embodied Through Virtual Reality  
  Abstract   
 This study aims to explore the potential connections between dance and extended realities. This interdisciplinary approach is based on the concept of dance mediated by technological intervention. In other words, technology isn’t merely used for illustration; it serves as a pivotal catalyst for physicality and aesthetic outcomes. Within this research, we’re considering both virtual and augmented reality, in addition to the metaverse and imagery generated through 360-degree cameras. Understanding how these systems and tools can enhance technological mediation in dance creation is intriguing. Technological mediation can introduce novel bodily triggers and extraordinary perceptions for both dancers and the audience, aligning with the objectives of the artistic proposal. The experiences with video conferencing during the pandemic played a critical role in shaping what I’ve termed “immersion dramaturgy.” Employing expanded realities has been essential in delving deeper into this form of narrative. The text highlights and deliberates upon the following artistic endeavors: “Itaara” (Hub, Mozilla), “ECOS” (Virtual Reality), and “Em_Corpa” (360-degree video, Augmented Reality).

 Dance and New Technologies: Different Interdisciplinary Approaches in Teaching and Practice  
  Abstract   
 The present article’s goal is to present reflections on the integration of technologies in the field of dance, whether in a context of performance environments or teaching-learnings ones. It also shares experiences and insights about interdisciplinary projects that involve dance, music, and new technologies. Therefore, the main goal is to showcase the challenges faced and the benefits of this interdisciplinary approach, as well as the opportunities that arise from the intersection of these different fields. Supported by a brief historical context, the potential of technology’s use in relation to dance is explored, both from the perspective of the researching artist and that of the educator. Finally, the article seeks to understand how to expand the accessibility of this interaction between dance, music, and technology in various contexts. The ultimate aim is to bring the research conducted within the university to broader audiences and locations.

 Dance and Technology: Different Readings of the Technologically Mediated Body  
  Abstract   
 This article investigates the relationship established between dance and technology in the contemporary artistic-creative scope, with special focus on the different poetic developments present in the body and dance in virtualized contexts. Such reflections seek to understand and deepen their modes and structures of creation, the different relationships established between movement, body, and technology, as well as their receptivity and interactivity with the public and / or spectator. As a methodology, the article focuses on the production of knowledge from the investigation and reflection on theoretical research developed in the area in conjunction with the practical analysis of works relevant to the proposed discussions. To this end, the research is based on theoretical studies on dance-technology (SANTANA, 2006; AMORIM, 2009) and screendance (ANGELI, 2020 and 2022; CALDAS, 2012), in addition to proposing the analysis of two Brazilian artistic works produced in this creative category and important for the reflections on dance and technology: the screendance Unusual  (2018) and the artistic work Interferences  (2022).

 Art as an Expanded Field: The Case of the R/Place Social Experiment  
  Abstract   
 In this paper, we will present the social experiment originating from the website Reddit, r/place, and our findings regarding how this experiment has been analyzed and understood, with three interpretations of our studies that could be associated with r/place. On top of that, we will introduce our art research methodology, “art as an expanded field,” in which r/place will be our subject of analysis, with the concept of artification described by scholar Ellen Dissanayake as our theoretical starting point for such an endeavor. It is not in the interest of this work to thoroughly analyze r/place but to present a paradigm for understanding it and possibly further experiments, as well as present the beginnings of our methodology currently developed.

 This communication intends to present a practical case developed within the context of an exploratory project on cyberperformance, titled CyPeT. As part of this project, we surveyed the strategies developed by teachers, creators and performers during periods of confinement and identified the possibilities and challenges that cyberperformance brought to the context of the performing arts. Resulting from a collaborative creative process, the experimental cyberperformance Ophilia  , created by the team involved in this study, aims at learning more about creation in a digital medium through practice. Ophilia  is a work in progress, developed through the implementation of an arts-based research methodology, that allowed the team of researchers/creators to identify creative strategies inherent to cyberperformance while adapting Shakespeare's character Ophelia to a new medium. Above all, during this process, we were able to identify various technological limitations inherent to the platforms provided by educational institutions when applied to the creation of cyberperformances.

 Bridging Computational Art and Climate Change: An Analysis of a Mobile Application for Raising Awareness About Climate Change Through Art  
  Abstract   
 This article focuses on the complex process of translating scientific data, specifically related to climate change, into comprehensible narratives aimed at engaging the non-expert public. Challenging the prevailing assumption that data possesses inherent communicative capacity, we analyze the complicated work involved in converting scientific data into meaningful visualizations and narratives. Furthermore, we investigate how artists have been contributing to transform the abstract aspects of climate change into tangible, emotionally resonant experiences, thereby cultivating novel forms of climate-aware public engagement. We then use this analysis to present and discuss the GaiaSenses Project, an innovative research project converging art, science, and computational technology. Through location-based audiovisual compositions driven by weather data, the project aims to establish a more intimate connection between individuals and the realities of climate change, fostering heightened environmental sensibility. By presenting and analyzing the GaiaSenses Project, this article reflects upon the transformative potential of computational creative systems in raising public awareness about climate change and stimulating climate action.

 Guitar Improvisation Preparation and Practice: A Digital-Assisted Approach Integrating Set Theory and Mechanical Gesture Exploration  
  Abstract   
 In this paper, we introduce a framework for improvisation in classical and contemporary guitar preparation. Our proposal follows a digitally assisted approach to support guitarists in practicing improvisation and creating coherent musical discourses. By simplifying the complex tasks involved in evolving a mechanical gesture and controlling harmonic development, the framework aims to enhance improvisation in the context of contemporary classical music. The paper addresses the challenges faced by classical guitarists in improvisation and emphasizes the significance of integrating mechanical memory and audition. We argue that guitarists can expand their harmonic palette and enhance their improvisational skills by following our digitally assisted approach that integrates critically Set theory principles and the exploration of mechanical gestures. The paper discusses the conceptual foundations of the framework, including the integration of Set theory and mechanical gesture exploration. It also outlines the contributions of the authors, which include the framework itself, computer modeling for the problem, and the implementation of an open-source tool for interacting with the framework. Our main goal in this work is to provide a valuable resource for guitarists interested in improvisation and to broaden the possibilities for creative expression in the realm of classical contemporary guitar performance.

 Dignitas in the Metaverse  
  Abstract   
 In response to increasing calls to address “human dignity” in the Metaverse, the Royal College of Art’s MA Fashion Programme utilised Epic’s “Metahuman Creator” software to create multiple digital identities. Human dignity has its etymological root in the Latin ‘dignitas’, and is translated as worth. For the purpose of this study, its meaning is derived from the Charter of the United Nations ( 1945  ) which defines the fundamental rights of the humacy3n person, their equality, dignity and worth.   
 Epic’s “Metahuman Creator” is a new type of digital human configurator, based on pre-existing scans of real people where only physically plausible adjustments can be made. As it has a vast range of facial features and skin tones the user can design a variety of digital characters. However, its tools representing trans identities and invisible disabilities have limitations. Here we show the experience of two users, one with a hearing disability and the other undergoing gender-affirming therapy.   
 We found that tools for representing their identity fell short of expressing their inherent human dignity. The foundations of the Metaverse are therefore at risk of replicating inaccessibility and excluding persons with disabilities and gender differences.   
 We anticipate our paper to be the starting point for wider participatory research that involves all user groups in the design of platforms, tools and systems. We foresee the findings of our paper fulfilling the UN Charter on Human rights in the digital space through the shaping of policies and advancing existing standards (ISO).

 Using Generative Models to Create a Visual Description of Climate Change  
  Abstract   
 The discrepancy between the rapid dissemination of information and its effective communication underlies the phenomenon of scientific denialism. Given the rapid strides in AI generative models, this project explores the domain of knowledge visualization to portray weather data through a visually captivating representation of Rio de Janeiro’s climate evolution up to the year 2100. The use of prompt engineering over climate models has yielded promising outcomes in image generation, yet challenges remain in ensuring deterministic accuracy in image construction.

 ASPLOS 2025 Call for Papers  
  
 Synopsis  
 ASPLOS, the ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems, is the premier academic forum for multidisciplinary applied computer systems research spanning hardware, software, and their interaction. It focuses on practical aspects of computer architecture, programming languages, operating systems, and associated areas such as networking and storage. ASPLOS 2025 will take place in March-April 2025 in Rotterdam, co-located with EuroSys 2025.  
 ASPLOS 2025 has three submission deadlines – spring, summer and fall – which are meant to encourage authors to submit their papers when they are ready. As in recent years, ASPLOS 2025 will allow the authors of some submissions to choose to apply a major revision to their submission in order to fix a well-defined list of problems.

  All deadlines are AoE.   
 Scope and Expectations  
 The scope of ASPLOS 2025 covers all practical aspects related to the three main ASPLOS disciplines: computer architecture, programming languages, and operating systems, as well as closely-related associated areas. ASPLOS construes systems  broadly, and areas of interest include, but are not limited to: operating systems, file and storage systems, distributed systems, cloud computing, mobile and edge systems, secure and reliable systems, systems aspects of big data and machine learning, embedded and real-time systems, and virtualization. We seek original, high-quality research submissions that improve and further the knowledge of applied computer systems, with emphasis on the intersection between the main ASPLOS disciplines. Research submission may be applicable to computer systems of any scale, ranging from small, ultra-low power wearable devices to large scale parallel computers and data centers. We embrace research that directly targets new problems in innovative ways. The research may target diverse goals, such as throughput, latency, energy, and security. Non-traditional topics are encouraged, and the review process will be sensitive to the challenges of multidisciplinary work in emerging areas. We welcome submission of “experience papers” that have a novel component and that clearly articulate the lessons learned. We likewise welcome submissions whereby novelty lies in furthering our understandings of existing systems, e.g., by uncovering previously unknown, valuable insights or by convincingly refuting prior published results and common wisdom. We value submissions more highly if they are accompanied by clearly defined artifacts not previously available, including traces, original data, source code, or tools developed as part of the submitted work. We particularly encourage new ideas and approaches.  
 Alphabetically sorted areas of interest related to practical aspects of computer architecture, programming languages, and operating systems include but are not limited to:  
 Existing, emerging, and nontraditional compute platforms at all scales 
  Heterogeneous architectures and accelerators 
  Internet services, cloud computing, and datacenters 
  Memory, storage, networking, and I/O 
  Power, energy, and thermal management 
  Profiling, debugging, and testing 
  Security, reliability, and availability 
  Systems for enabling parallelism and computation on big data 
  Virtualization and virtualized systems 
  A good submission will typically: motivate a significant problem; propose a practical solution or approach that makes sense; demonstrate not just the pros but also the cons of the proposal using sound experimental methods; explicitly disclose what has and has not been implemented; articulate the new contributions beyond previous work; and refrain from overclaiming, focusing the abstract and introduction sections primarily on the difference between the new proposal and what is already available. The latter statement should be interpreted broadly to also encompass studies that broaden our understanding of existing systems (rather than suggest new ones), which may constitute a significant problem in its own right. Submissions will be judged on relevance, novelty, technical merit, and clarity. Submissions are expected to adhere to SIGPLAN’s Empirical Evaluation Guidelines  and all the policies specified below.  
 Resubmissions  
 Authors of resubmitted work must describe in a separate note—to be uploaded to the submission site at submission time—the changes since the previous submission(s). This description helps reviewers who may have reviewed a previous draft of the work to appreciate any improvements to the currently submitted work. Please try to limit this document to one page.  
 For resubmitted work that received a “Major Revision” followed by a revised submission, the revision also counts as a submission  , so the note should describe changes relative to the revision rather than the original submission.  
 Submissions rejected from ASPLOS must not be submitted to the next two subsequent review cycles. The corresponding restrictions on ASPLOS ‘25 submissions are thus:  
 Papers rejected in 2024 Spring, or earlier, are now eligible for resubmission to ASPLOS. 
  Papers rejected in 2024 Summer may not resubmit until ASPLOS 2025 Summer (or later). 
  Papers rejected in 2024 Fall may not resubmit until ASPLOS 2025 Fall (or later). 
  These resubmission rules are strict and hold even if a submission has undergone extensive revision. If a paper is withdrawn from an ASPLOS cycle after reviews are made available  , it is considered “rejected” from that cycle (and cannot be resubmitted to the next two cycles).  
 Major Revisions  
 In addition to Accept and Reject outcomes, ASPLOS 2025 will offer some submissions a “Major Revision” decision. The authors of such submissions will be given the opportunity to apply a major revision to their work and resubmit it at the camera ready deadline (6 weeks from notification). These submissions will be provided with clear and actionable reviewer feedback for their revision, and they will be typically reviewed by some of the same reviewers as the original submission. If the revision requirements are satisfactorily met, the revised submission will be accepted.  
 Revised submissions can use 13 pages (the same length as camera-ready versions, and 2 pages more than the original submission). The additional length is intended to let authors address the revision requirements.  
 Accept or reject notifications for spring and summer major revisions will coincide with the notifications of the subsequent cycle. Notifications of fall major revisions will occur no later than two months after the revisions have been resubmitted.  
 Anonymization  
 ASPLOS employs a double-blind review process, keeping author identities concealed from reviewers and vice versa. You must therefore make a good faith attempt to anonymize your submission by avoiding identifying yourself or your institution/affiliation in any of the submitted documents (except in specific fields on the HotCRP submission form designated for this purpose), either explicitly or by implication, e.g., through references, acknowledgments, online repositories that are referenced by the submission, or interaction with committee members.  
 Do not include a “reference removed for blind review” text or similar in your submission. When it is necessary to cite your own studies, cite them as written by a third party. Only if that is not possible, they can be uploaded and cited as anonymized supplemental material (see below). This applies to workshop papers that are being extended by your current ASPLOS submission, and related submissions of your own that are simultaneously under review or awaiting publication at other venues. Publication as a technical report or in an online repository does not constitute a violation of this policy, and some other exceptions apply; see the “originality and concurrent submissions” section below for details.  
 Please make sure not to reveal author and/or affiliation information through side channels and other less obvious means. For example, the metadata included in the PDF should not give away such information. If you’d like to point to a repository of, e.g., the working code of your system (which is great and much appreciated), this repository should, of course, be anonymized. It is okay and often makes sense to create anonymized repositories merely for the sake of an anonymous submission. If your system is already released to the public, rename it in your submission. You should likewise avoid inadvertently revealing affiliation in your submission by identifying your company’s name in situations where, e.g., it is clear that the authors of the submission most probably work for the company that manufactures the device or provides the service that constitutes the topic of your work; instead, please use a generic name, like “a computer server vendor X,” “a cloud service provider Y,” and such like.  
 If concealing system name or affiliation would make your paper difficult to understand, contact the program chairs to discuss exceptions to this policy. Submissions that are not properly anonymized will likely be rejected without review.  
 Anonymized Supplemental Material  
 Supplemental material may be submitted as a single-but-separate anonymized PDF file without page limit. The nature of such material is explained in the above “anonymization” section. We permit uploading such material exclusively for the purpose of handling specific anonymity issues.  
 The submission must be self-contained within the page limit, and the supplemental material mechanism should not be used as a way to circumvent this limit. The reviewers are neither required nor encouraged to read such material when making their decision.  
 Declaring Conflicts of Interest  
 Authors must register all their conflicts in their HotCRP submission page. Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate assignment of reviewers. If a submission is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem or if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or “game” the review system, the submission will be summarily rejected.  
 Both people and institutions (companies, universities, and other relevant organizations) may be declared as having a conflict of interest (COI) with respect to an author. Please declare a COI with the following for any author of your submission; please do so with respect to all your conflicts, not just restricted to program committee (PC) and extended review committee (ERC) members, as we may occasionally ask for external reviews from people outside the PC/ERC.  
 Your current institution(s) and other institutions that you were affiliated with in the past four years relative to the submission deadline; also, an institution that is about to become your employer. 
  Your PhD advisor(s), post-doctoral host(s), PhD students, and post-doctoral advisees; these COIs are forever. 
  Family relations by blood or marriage and close personal friends (who may potentially be reviewers); these COIs are likewise forever. 
  People with whom you have collaborated in the last four years, including co-authors of accepted/rejected/pending paper submissions and co-PIs of accepted/rejected/pending grant proposals. 
  Potential reviewers who shared your primary institution(s) in the last four years, or where one is actively engaged in discussions about employment with the other person’s institution. 
  When there is a direct funding relationship between an author and a potential reviewer (e.g., the reviewer is a sponsor of an author’s research on behalf of his/her company or vice versa). 
  Among PIs of research structures supported under the same umbrella funding award who (1) participate regularly in non-public meetings sponsored by that umbrella award, and (2) are regularly exposed to presentations or discussions of unpublished work at such meetings. 
  Do not declare a COI for the following cases:  
 You must not declare a COI with a reviewer just because that reviewer works on topics similar to or related to those in your paper. 
  “Service” collaborations such as co-authoring a report for a professional organization or an open-source community, serving on a program committee, or co-presenting tutorials, do not themselves create a COI. 
  Co-authoring a paper that is a compendium of various projects without direct collaboration among the projects does not constitute a conflict among the authors of the different projects. 
  Internships constitute a conflict of interest during the period of employment of the intern, but not thereafter, unless some other provision applies (e.g., co-authorship or ongoing research collaboration after the internship). Graduate students are not presumed to have an automatic COI with their undergraduate institution. On the other hand, prospective graduate students do have a COI with any institution they have applied to if they are actively engaged in discussions with any faculty member at that institution. Once they join an institution to pursue graduate studies, automatic COIs with any other prospective institutions sunset. In all these cases, the collaboration COI above still applies. 
  When in doubt, contact the program chairs and ask.  
 Declaring Authors  
 Declare all the authors of the submission upfront. Addition/removal of authors once the submission is accepted will have to be approved by the program chairs, since it potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts for reviewer assignment.  
 Declaring Areas and Topics  
 ASPLOS emphasizes multidisciplinary research. Submissions should ideally – albeit not necessarily – emphasize synergy of two or more of the three main ASPLOS disciplines: computer architecture, programming languages, and operating systems (broadly interpreted). Authors should therefore indicate at least one of these areas on the submission form and, preferably, more than one.  
 Authors should also indicate on the submission form more focused topics matching their work, which will be used for reviewer assignment.  
 Originality and Concurrent Submissions  
 By submitting a manuscript to ASPLOS, the authors guarantee that the manuscript has not been previously published or accepted for publication in a substantially similar form in any conference, journal, or workshop. The only exceptions are (1) workshops without archived proceedings such as in the ACM digital library (or where the authors chose not to have their paper appear in the archived proceedings), or (2) venues such as IEEE CAL where there is an explicit policy that such publication does not preclude longer conference submissions. These are not considered prior publications. Technical reports and papers posted on public social media sites, web pages, or online repositories such as arxiv.org are not considered prior publications either. In these cases, the submitted manuscript may ignore the posted work to preserve author anonymity.  
 The authors additionally guarantee that no manuscript that contains significant overlap with the contributions of the submitted document is or will be under review for any other conference, journal, or workshop during the ASPLOS review cycle for which it was submitted. Violation of any of these conditions will lead to rejection and possibly additional actions against the offending authors.  
 You should also adhere to the ACM Plagiarism Policy ( http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy  ), which covers a range of ethical issues concerning the misrepresentation of other works or one’s own work.  
 As usual, if in doubt, consult with the program chairs.  
 Ethical and Other Obligations  
 Authors are not allowed to break anonymity when interacting with known ASPLOS PC/ERC members, e.g., by mentioning/identifying work that they plan to submit to ASPLOS or have already submitted and is currently under review. 
  Authors are not allowed to contact reviewers or PC/ERC members in order to encourage or solicit them to bid on any submission; to attempt to sway a reviewer or PC/ERC member to review any submission positively or negatively; to contact reviewers or PC/ERC members requesting any type of information about the reviewing process, either in general or specifically about submitted manuscripts; to contact reviewers or PC/ERC members to ask about the outcomes of any submission. 
  Authors are not allowed to advertise their work during the period starting two weeks before the submission deadline and ending when the results of the review cycle are publicized. The work includes the submission itself and closely related documents such as technical reports or arxiv.org uploads. Advertisement pertains to such communication channels such as social media, community blogs, and web pages. To clarify, authors are indeed allowed to upload their submission to arxiv.org and other such online repositories; the restriction relates to advertising such postings. 
  Authors are not allowed to post in the aforementioned channels about the content of the reviews they may have received until the results of the corresponding review cycle are publicized; “shaming” (and thus potentially applying pressure on) reviewers before the review process terminates is considered unethical. 
  Authors must abide by the ACM ethics policy ( | https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics | ). 
  Violation of these policies might result in rejection of the submission and possible additional action by the ACM.  
 ACM requires that all submitting authors will be aware of the following policies in particular:  
 By submitting your article to an ACM publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Formatting and Editing  
 We will use the same format template for submission and camera-ready versions. Submissions must be printable PDF files. When creating your submission, you must use the sigplan proceedings template of ACM’s acmart Latex class available on the official ACM site  . Your main LaTeX file should have the following structure:  
 % use the base acmart.cls  
  % use the sigplan proceeding template with the default 10 pt fonts  
  % nonacm option removes ACM related text in the submission.  
  \documentclass[sigplan,nonacm]{acmart}  
   
  % enable page numbers  
  \settopmatter{printfolios=true}  
   
  \begin{document}  
  \title{...}  
   
  \begin{abstract}  
  ...  
  \end{abstract}  
   
  \maketitle % should come after the abstract  
   
  % add the paper content here  
   
  % use the ACM bibliography style  
  \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}  
  \bibliography{...}  
   
  \end{document}  Your final submission should visually look similar to this sample  produced from the zip file above.  
 “Squeezing” Space is Forbidden.  Refrain from tweaking the aforementioned template and from formatting your text in a manner that violates its settings. Notably, refrain from squeezing additional space, e.g., by using \vspace or packages that manipulate vertical space. The template already generates a very dense document, and you must not make it denser. Your submission will be visually and automatically inspected using tools developed for this purpose, and it will be rejected if you violate the formatting policy, even if your PDF passed the HotCRP format check (which is unable to verify much of the requirements).  
 Page Layout and Limit.  Full submissions must not exceed 11 pages of single-spaced two-column text. This page limit applies to all text, figures, tables, footnotes, appendices, etc. The only exception is the bibliographic references section, which is not included in the page limit. The submission must be self-contained within the page limit, allowing reviewers to evaluate the work without having to consider any external or supplementary material outside this limit. The reviewers greatly value conciseness, so if you can describe your work with fewer pages than the limit, please do. All pages should be numbered.  
 Page Limit of Accepted Papers and Major Revisions.  The authors of an accepted paper are allowed to use +2 pages in the camera-ready version beyond the aforementioned page limit. The same applies to major revisions, to accommodate added experiments and such. In addition to this +2 automatic page limit increase, authors of accepted papers may purchase 1–2 more pages, if they wish (payment will be processed when registering to the conference).  
 Font Size, Tables, and Figures.  The submission’s text must use a 10pt font (not 9pt) or bigger. Labels, captions, and text within figures, graphs, and tables must use reasonable font sizes that, as printed, do not require extra magnification beyond “100%” to be legible. In particular, text inside figures/tables should generally use what appears to readers as a 9pt font or bigger after any intra-document scaling has been applied. Fonts appearing smaller than 8pt are not permitted. As noted, this and other requirements are not checked automatically by the HotCRP format checker, so it is the authors’ responsibility to check it. Figures can and should use colors but should also be color-blind friendly and readable when printed in monochrome. Spacing between figures/tables/captions/text should be determined by the latex template.  
 References.  Because references do not count against the page limit, the space they occupy should not be “optimized” away. Notably, the full, non-abbreviated first and last names of all co-authors of all citations must be specified (no “et al.”). The reference citations within the submission (numbers in square brackets) should be hyperlinked to the corresponding items in the references section, to ease the job of reviewers. Also, reviewers will very much appreciate clickable links (preferably DOI  s) associated with each entry in your references section.  
 Specifications.  The following table specifies some of the main typeset requirements. Use our mandatory latex template and follow the above instructions to make sure that these and other formatting requirements are met.

  Submissions that violate any of these restrictions might be rejected without being reviewed.   
 Author Response Period  
 ASPLOS 2024 will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to final consideration of the submissions at the program committee meeting; see exact dates specified above. Authors should generally focus their rebuttal on (1) correcting factual errors in the reviews and (2) directly addressing questions posed by reviewers. When a major revision is a realistic possibility, in addition to clarifying the submitted work, rebuttals may describe new experiments and data, if doing so addresses the reviewers’ concerns. Rebuttals are optional but strongly encouraged, and their absence might indicate to reviewers that authors are not interested in improving the work. There is no explicit word limit to a rebuttal, but authors are strongly encouraged to keep it under 800 words, and reviewers are not expected to read words that exceed this limit. Authors are not allowed to attach files to the rebuttal HotCRP comment.  
 Accepted Papers  
 Submissions selected by the program committee will be conditionally accepted, subject to revision and approval by a committee member acting as a shepherd. Accepted papers will be allowed two additional pages in the proceedings (and up to two more with a fee of $200 per page). We expect that one author of each accepted paper will physically attend the conference and present the work in a dedicated time slot (unless all  authors have difficulty traveling due to such serious limitations as visa restrictions, care-giving responsibilities, and disability). By default, all accepted papers will be made available online to registered attendees before the conference at a date that depends on the review cycle. Papers accepted to the spring and summer deadlines will be published in separate volumes in advance of the conference.  
 ACM requires that all authors of accepted papers will adhere to the following policy. Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all published authors  to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution, and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 Artifact Evaluation  
 Artifact evaluation will continue in 2025 as has become a tradition at ASPLOS. Please refer to the ASPLOS 2025 AEC  web page for more information.  
 Poster and Lightning Sessions  
 In addition to the regular presentations, the program may include poster and lightning sessions. If those are included, details can be found here when they become available.  
 Wild and Crazy Ideas Session  
 The program will also tentatively include a WACI session. Details will become available later.  
 Debate Session  
 Should the program include a debate session, details will be posted here.  
 Best Paper Award  
 The committee will select a handful of papers to receive a Best Paper Award. The decision may or may not be communicated to the winning authors prior to the official announcement at the opening session of the conference.  
 Program and Registration  
 Complete program and registration information will be available on the conference website as soon as it becomes available.  
 Confidentiality  
 All submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication. Rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential.

 Update to the AIAI Community from the Organisers  
 Dear Colleagues,  
 On behalf of the 21 st  AIAI (Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations) 2025 Organizing and Scientific Committee, it is a real honor and pleasure to welcome all Artificial Intelligence scholars who are looking for a well-established and prestigious forum to communicate and disseminate the innovative advances of their research. It is a fact that AI is continuously digging its way in a vast number of diverse scientific domains. AIAI aims to provide a forum for delegates from both academia and industry, who wish to share pioneer ideas, to get to know each other better and to present their research. Moreover, it aims to offer a deep glimpse into the future and to examine important AI ethical aspects.  
 The Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations  (AIAI) Conference has been held continuously since 2005, under the auspices of the IFIP WG12.5. Through the years, it has evolved to a well-respected and mature event, under the technical and scientific co-sponsorship of the AIAI community. This community comprises of an extended Group of leading scientists, not only from Europe but from all over the globe.  
 The h-index of the AIAI event is as high as 39  . This proves the novelty and quality of the presented-published research and its important contribution to the promotion of scientific ideas, algorithms and methods, globally. The fact that the conference Springer Proceedings, have been downloaded more than 2,800,000  times so far, supports the robust impact of the event among the scholars of AI internationally.. …[read more]

 IFIP AIAI Community  

 Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations (AIAI conference) started from Toulouse France.   
 Today, its society comprises of hundreds AI experts-enthusiasts, academicians and researchers from all over the globe (Europe, Asia, America and Australia). They are interacting by presenting their scientific achievements or by discussing numerous aspects of AI advances, under the 4th industrial revolution.  
  The AIAI conference now has its own society, consisting of followers who have been attending it for one or two decades in the row, while new members are constantly joining its family.  
  After almost two decades of continuous presence in the literature, the members of the AIAI society, have formed a very strong community under the auspices of the IFIP Working Group 12.5 (AI applications and Innovations). This group is divided in specific scientific subgroups-subcommunities, specializing in timely hot AI areas. Their members are organizing timely annual workshops specific by subject, which are run and attended by AI professionals-scientists who wish to share knowledge, ideas, problems and insights in every AI subdomain.  

 An indicative reference to the communities – societies that have been already formed under the auspices of the AIAI conference, would include (but not limited) the following:  

 • The Community of Mining Humanistic Data (driven by the Ionian University and the University of Patras, Greece).  
  • The Community of 5G technologies putting intelligence in the network’s Edge (driven by the Hellenic Telecommunication Organization (TO) and other European Union TOs.  
  • The Community of Cybersecurity innovations and Applications driven by the European Defense Agency (the European Union Security Organization).  
  • The Community of AI and Ethics (driven by Professor John Macintyre from the University of Sunderland UK, Professor Mathhias Scheutz, Tufts School of AS and other colleagues from the USA.  

 Though the above communities are here to stay, the above list is dynamic, as new Communities devoted to new AI subdomains are joining to this global event every year.  
  Apart from the papers’ presentation, the distinguished members of the AIAI (IFIP WG12.5) society are offering new insights by giving free Tutorials to conference delegates. This adds actual more merit to the event and enhances the benefits of the members of the AIAI community  
  One of the many benefits for the members of these subcommunities is the fact that they bring together scientists, who are interested either in a narrow specific domain or in hot multidisciplinary areas, or in an emerging subject. This can lead to increased connection and awareness of developments.  
  Under the framework of this community, new researchers are encouraged to proceed further to their developments, by receiving best papers awards together with financial awards, or checks provided by Springer to offer them free access to important scientific publications. Moreover, under the guise of noble rivalry, old and young researchers are invited to complete their research and submit their extended paper for review in prestigious scientific journals. Especially for the young researchers of the AIAI community, this is a unique opportunity to publish not only in the springer proceedings which have millions of recent citations, but also in major scientific journals with a high citation rate.

 _____________________________  
 The ArtsIT conference brings together a wide array of cross-/inter-/trans-disciplinary researchers, practitioners, artists, and academia to present and discuss the symbiosis between art (in its widest definition) and information technology applied in a variety of distinct fields. Since 2009 ArtsIT has become acknowledged as a leading scientific forum for the dissemination of cutting-edge research results in the intersection between art, science, culture, performing arts, media, and technology. The role of artistic practice using digital media is also to serve as a tool for analysis and critical reflection on how technologies influence our lives, culture, and society. ArtsIT is therefore not only a place to discuss technological progress but also a place to reflect on the impact of art and technology on sustainability, responsibility, and human dignity. Besides the main track, the event also focuses on the advances seen in diverse areas that have significantly contributed to the field in the last years, namely, Digital Musical Interfaces, virtualization and artificial intelligence with special sessions.

She is a former Chairperson of the British Society for Music Therapy, a former board member of the International Association of Music and Medicine, and serves on the editorial boards of several music therapy journals.    
 Title: Access, agency and aesthetics: developments music therapy and technology   
 Abstract:   
 Technology in its broadest sense has long afforded access to music-making in situations where the use of traditional instruments limits access. Whether adaptive or digital, music technology can enhance an individual’s agency in creativity. Beyond merely physical advantages, the recent widespread adoption of virtual platforms has illustrated the affordances that technology may offer from geographical and economic perspectives as well. However, many challenges persist from aesthetic and sensory perspectives. This presentation will share latest developments globally in technological applications in music therapy, considering cultural, aesthetic and ethical dimensions.  
   Marcelo M. Wanderley    
 Professor of Music Technology at McGill University, Canada    
 Title: Five Decades of Computer Music Interfaces: from ICMC & CMJ to NIME   
 Bio:   
 Marcelo M. Wanderley is a Professor of Music Technology at McGill University, Canada. His research interests include the design and evaluation of digital musical instruments and the analysis of performer movements. He co-edited the electronic book “Trends in Gestural Control of Music” in 2000, co-authored the textbook “New Digital Musical Instruments: Control and Interaction Beyond the Keyboard” in 2006, and chaired the 2003 International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME03). He is a member of the Computer Music Journal’s Editorial Advisory Board and a senior member of the ACM and the IEEE.    
 Abstract:   
 Computer music interfaces, aka musical interfaces or gestural controllers, have been a topic of interest since the beginning of academic gatherings and journals on computer music, including the International Computer Music Conference (ICMC) and the Computer Music Journal (CMJ). This interest builds upon previous developments in electronic music instruments, which have been proposed for more than a century (Chadabe, 1997). The establishment of the International Conference on New Interfaces in 2002, after the original NIME workshop in 2001, has decoupled the number of academic publications in the field from a few hundred to thousands. In this talk, I will discuss research on musical interfaces starting in the late 70s until today, pointing out various trends with more or less longevity that permeate the development of musical interfaces. Examples include works on interface design and evaluation, mapping, and haptic feedback, as well as tools to help the community navigate among the works published since then.

 Title: Sound-Music-Movement Interaction: from listening to performing, from general public to musician, from solo to collective experiences   
 Abstract:   
 Embodied music interaction, is a broad framework that describe the role of our movement and body in listening, playing or more generally experiencing music. Within this framework, the use of interactive technologies enable opportunities for designing a large variety of systems and instruments. In this talk, I will describe approaches, design methodologies, computational models using machine learning we developed over the years to explore different types of movement-based music interaction. Interestingly, this allows us to consider different perspectives in embodied music interaction such as listening / performing, beginner / virtuoso, solo / collective. I will in particular describe issues in learning and appropriating interactive technologies, ranging from artistic creation to health.

 Authors when submitting the paper are required to declare the conflict of interest (COI) with the Program Committee members including the chairs. Those who are considered COI include (1) anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author of the paper at the time of submission, (2) anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author at any time in the past, or (3) anyone the author has collaborated or published within the prior two years. PC members, including chairs that have a conflict of interest with a paper, will be entirely excluded from the evaluation of that paper. Failure of declaring COI, or declaring fake COI can lead to the paper being rejected. If a paper is reviewed by a PC member with COI, it will be rejected.  

 Anonymous Submissions  

 ASIACCS is employing a double-blind reviewing process. All submissions should be appropriately anonymized. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should avoid obvious self-references and should appropriately blind them if used. The list of authors cannot be changed (but the order can be) after the acceptance decision is made unless approved by the Program Chairs.  

 Double and Concurrent Submissions  

 Submissions to ASIACCS 2023 must not substantially overlap with papers that are published or simultaneously submitted to other venues with proceedings (including journals or conferences/workshops). Double-submission will result in immediate rejection. Detected violations may be reported to other conference chairs and journal editors.  

 Ethical Considerations  

 The authors should take care of clarifying any potential ethical and legal concerns to their results, highly critical vulnerabilities or exploits, etc. The authors should provide evidence that they have thoroughly considered such issues.The Program Committee reserves the right to reject a submission if insufficient evidence was presented that ethical or relevant legal concerns were appropriately addressed.  

 Early Rejection and Appeals  

 There will be no conventional rebuttal process. Papers that receive substantially negative initial reviews will be rejected early. The authors of early-rejected papers, and only such papers, will receive a copy of their initial reviews. Authors who substantively disagree with the reviews can appeal to the PC chairs within 72 hours upon receipt of the notification mail. Authors’ appeals must clearly and explicitly identify concrete disagreements with factual statements in the initial reviews that should be adjudicated by a special arbitration reviewer who may be recruited by the PC chairs. Appealing a submission that was rejected early will keep it under consideration, and it cannot be withdrawn or resubmitted elsewhere until the final notification of acceptance or rejection.  

 Paper Revision and Re-submission  

 Rejected papers in the 1st round cannot be resubmitted in the 2nd round. A small number of the 1st round submissions may receive a Revise decision, rather than Accept or Reject, and may be revised and resubmitted together with the response to reviewers’ comments into the same HOTCRP submission server .  The revision may include running additional experiments, improving the paper’s presentation, or other such improvements. Papers meeting the expectations will typically be accepted. Additional revisions will be requested only in exceptional circumstances.  

 Camera-Ready and Conference Presentation  

 If a paper is accepted, the author list in submission cannot be changed when preparing the camera-ready version. Authors of accepted papers must also guarantee that their papers will be presented at the conference. At least one author of the paper must be registered at the appropriate full conference rate.

 Lần Đầu Tiên, PTIT Và Đại Học Western Sydney Đồng Tổ Chức Hội Nghị Quốc Tế APCC (Asia-Pacific Conference On Communications) Tại Australia  
 Tin Tức  
  by  tuyensinh2    
 10/07/2023    

 Theo kế hoạch hợp tác với Đại học Western Sydney (Australia), vào tháng 11/2023, Học viện Công nghệ Bưu chính Viễn thông sẽ đồng tổ chức Hội nghị Truyền thông Châu Á – Thái Bình Dương (APCC) lần thứ 28 với tư cách là nhà tài trợ.   
 APCC là một diễn đàn quốc tế chuyên về lĩnh vực truyền thông và công nghệ thông tin. Từ năm 1993, APCC đã được tổ chức tại 10 quốc gia Châu Á-Thái Bình Dương như Hàn Quốc (1993, 2000, 2006, 2012, 2022), Nhật Bản (1995, 2001, 2008, 2015), Trung Quốc (1999, 2004, 2009, 2018), Australia (1997, 2005, 2017), Indonesia (2002, 2013, 2016), Malaysia (2003, 2011, 2021), Thái Lan (2007, 2014), Singapore (1998), New Zealand (2010) và Việt Nam (2019)…  
 Năm nay, APCC lần thứ 28, còn được gọi là APCC2023, lần thứ 4 được tổ chức tại Australia, nhờ vào nỗ lực to lớn và sự hỗ trợ mạnh mẽ của Đại học Western Sydney. Một trong những mục đích chính của chuỗi hội nghị APCC là cung cấp cho các nhà nghiên cứu và kỹ sư trong khu vực Châu Á-Thái Bình Dương cơ hội thảo luận về các chủ đề liên quan đến công nghệ và dịch vụ truyền thông tiên tiến, đồng thời mở ra cánh cửa ra thế giới.  
 Thông qua các cuộc thảo luận trực tiếp tương tác đó, chuỗi APCC, với tư cách là một hội nghị quốc tế thường xuyên trong khu vực Châu Á-Thái Bình Dương, có thể tăng cường hiệu quả sự hợp tác nghiên cứu và phát triển các công nghệ truyền thông trong tương lai.  
 Với vai trò đồng tổ chức APCC2023, Học viện sẽ cử các chuyên gia hàng đầu của Học viện tham dự và cùng đóng góp vào các công tác tổ chức hội nghị quốc tế uy tín này.

 Authors must submit full-length, double-columned, original papers, with a maximum of 6 pages in PDF format (including the abstract, figures and tables) and are recommended to format their papers based on the ACM template. One page of references is allowed, which does not count towards the 6-page limitation. ASP-DAC does not allow double and/or parallel submissions of similar work to any other conferences, symposia, and journals. The submission must not include information that serves to identify the authors of the manuscript, such as name(s) or affiliation(s) of the author(s), anywhere in the manuscript, abstract, references and bibliographic citations. While research papers with open-source software are highly encouraged where the software will be made publicly available (via GitHub or similar), the authors’ identities need to be anonymized in the submitted paper for the double-blind review process. Issuing the paper as a technical report, posting the paper on a website, or presenting the paper at a workshop that does not publish formally reviewed proceedings, does not disqualify it from appearing in the proceedings. Submissions of pre-print papers, e.g., published on arXiv, are also allowed in ASP-DAC 2025. However, that the authors are expected to follow all reasonable efforts to ensure that the submission is compliant with the double-blind review process. Note that each paper shall be accompanied by at least one different conference registration at the speaker’s registration rate. ACM and IEEE reserve the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore) if the paper is not presented at the conference by any author.

 About   

 The Asia Pacific Bioinformatics Conference (APBC) series is an annual international forum for exploring research, development, and novel applications in the field of bioinformatics. The aim of APBC is to bring together academia and industry to share knowledge and experiences and to showcase innovations and achievements. It has been held since 2003 around Asia Pacific Regions.  
   
  The 21st APBC will be held in Changsha, China. The aim of this conference is to bring together researchers, academics, and industrial practitioners. APBC2023 invites high-quality original full papers on any topic related to bioinformatics and computational biology.  
   
  The goal of the Research Topic is to bring together high-quality papers that exploit the usage of innovative artificial intelligence methods that focus on the analysis of biomedical data. The central focus of the Research Topic is aligned with the theme of APBC 2023. We encourage submissions central to the theme in all areas of bioinformatics and computational biology, which are in scope for either Computational Genomics   section of Frontier in Genetics. Submission of Original Research, Review, Mini-Review, Technology, and Code articles are welcome.  
   
  The list of possible topics includes, but is not limited to:  
  • Single-cell sequencing data analysis  
  • Genome analysis  
  • Drug design and discovery  
  • Bioimaging  
  • Biological network analysis  
  • Epigenetic modification  
  • Biomedical text mining  
  • Precision medicine  
  • High-performance bio-computing  
  • DNA, RNA, Protein interactions, and diseases  
  For more information about the event, please access the website:  
  http://bioinformatics.csu.edu.cn/APBC2023/index.html    
   
  Please note:   
  1. Quantitative analysis needs to be performed on a minimum number of 3 biological replicates in order to enable an assessment of significance and ensure the depth of the analysis. This includes quantitative omics studies as well as phenotypic measurements, quantitative assays, and qPCR expression analysis. Studies that do not comply with these replication requirements will not be considered for review.  
   
  2. Studies falling in the categories below will also not be considered for review unless they are extended to provide meaningful insights into gene/protein function and/or the biology of the subject described. Studies relating to the prediction of clinical outcomes require some validation of findings:  
  · Comparative transcriptomic analyses that only report a collection of differentially expressed genes, some validated by qPCR under different conditions or treatments;  
  · Re-analysis of existing genomic, and transcriptomic data which attempts to identify a candidate set of diagnostic or prognostic markers for disease.  
  · Descriptive studies that merely define gene families using basic phylogenetics and assign cursory functional attributions (e.g. expression profiles, hormone or metabolites levels, promoter analysis, informatic parameters).

 30th Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference (APSEC 2023)  
   
 It has been 30 years since the establishment of the Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference (APSEC) as a leading regional conference that gathers researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to exchange knowledge and best practices in software engineering, and to address emerging challenges and solutions in software engineering innovation. This year’s APSEC will be held on December 4-7, 2023 in Seoul, Korea. APSEC 2023 will continue in the tradition of previous editions of this regional conference. As in past APSEC series, the main research track features the most recent and significant innovations in the field of software engineering and all its sub-disciplines. APSEC 2023 also invites submissions of high-quality research papers that describe original and unpublished results on theoretical and empirical software engineering research topics.  
 APSEC 2023 will offer an extensive program of interest to academia, government, and industry. It will include several distinguished keynote speakers and conference days of paper presentations and demos. A series of exciting tutorials to develop skills in various aspects of software engineering practices is of particular interest to the industry. Co-located workshops offer forums for participants to present novel techniques and methods in specific sub-disciplines of software engineering. To celebrate its 30th anniversary, APSEC 2023 will also provide special events such as APSEC’s 30th Anniversary MIPs Session, and Student Research Competition (SRC).

 The growth of social media and user generated platforms has disrupted the video advertising ecosystem. But there is a huge difference in the viewing experience and audience engagement offered by platforms that are primarily driven by user generated content and publishers who carefully curate and invest millions in content for viewers.  
 The advances in ad tech and the increasing prevalence of Connected TVs today also enable far greater addressability and much richer data and insights, with the possibility of TV turning into a full funnel marketing medium becoming a reality in the not-too-distant future. With premium video advertising, whether on OTT, linear pay TV, FAST or FTA broadcast, now presenting significant new revenue opportunities, this year’s OTT Summit focuses on Advertising First.  
 In a separate conference track running parallel to the main plenary sessions in the afternoon, key publishers will also be presenting the latest data and insights, programming slates and advertising innovations in a series of Upfront Showcases.

  Submission Instructions  
 Similar to previous years, ACML 2023 has two publication tracks  . Authors may submit either to:  
 Conference Track: | (16-page limit with references) for which the proceedings will be published as a volume of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research Workshop and Conference Proceedings (PMLR). 
  Journal Track: | (20-page limit with references) for which accepted papers will appear in a special issue of the Springer Machine Learning Journal (MLJ). 
  Please note that submission procedures for the two tracks are different. Please read the instructions carefully before submitting.    
 Conference Track  
 Submission Deadline: June 30, 2023  June 23, 2023   For the conference track, please submit your manuscript via CMT at: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACML2023  .  
 IMPORTANT:   When creating a new submission on CMT, please ensure you choose the "Conference"  track.  
 The Latex submission template and style file can be found here: ACML2023_submission_template.zip  .  
  The Latex camera-ready template and style file can be found here: ACML2023_camera-ready_template.zip  .  
 Manuscripts must be written in English, be a maximum of 16 pages (including references, appendices, etc.) and follow the PMLR style. If required, supplementary material may be submitted as a separate file, but reviewers are not obliged to consider this.  
 All conference track submissions must be anonymized  . Submissions that are not anonymized, over-length, or not in the correct format will be rejected without review. To anonymize, simply leave the author information empty in the Tex template. There is no separate format for anonymizing.  
 It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g., in arXiv) as long as it is not cited in the submission.  
 Journal Track  
 Submission Deadline: June 02, 2023  May 26, 2023   In addition to the conference track, this year’s ACML will run a journal track, similar to previous years. Papers that are accepted to the journal track must be presented at the conference in order to be published.  
 IMPORTANT:   Similar to previous years, for the journal track, the abstract and the paper must be submitted to two different systems simultaneously   for the purpose of review management:  
 First, please submit ONLY the title and abstract via CMT at: | https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACML2023. | (paper manuscript need not be submitted here). When creating the submission on CMT, please choose the | "Journal" | track. 
  Then, please submit the paper via Springer’s Editorial Manager system at: | https://www.editorialmanager.com/mach. | When creating a new submission on Springer’s Editorial Manager, please make sure to choose | "S.I.: ACML 2023" | as the article type. 
  For the journal track, manuscripts must be written in English with a maximum of 20 pages (including references, appendices, etc.). For the template and style files, please follow the instructions for authors on the journal website: https://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10994  .  
 The journal track will follow the reviewing process of the Machine Learning journal. This includes allowing papers that require minor changes to be resubmitted after a first-round review. The journal track committee will aim to complete the reviewing process in time for this year’s conference. In the unlikely event that the reviewing process for a paper is not completed in time (for this year’s conference), the paper will not be considered for the conference and the review will be completed as a regular submission to the Machine Learning journal.  
 The journal track review is single-blind, i.e., the authors’ identity will be visible to reviewers. It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. Submissions that are not in the correct format will be rejected without review. In addition, extended versions of published conference papers are not eligible for journal track submission. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g., in arXiv).

 Introduction   
 The 21st Asian Symposium on Programming Languages and Systems  ( APLAS  ) aims to stimulate programming language research by providing a forum for the presentation of the latest results and the exchange of ideas in programming languages and systems. APLAS is based in Asia but is an international forum that serves the worldwide programming languages community. This year’s conference is co-located with Agda Implementors’ Meeting XXXVII  .  
 APLAS 2023 was held in Taipei, Taiwan  from Monday 27th to Wednesday 29th November 2023. Before the main conference, the New Ideas and Emerging Results (NIER)  workshop was held on Sunday 26th November 2023. There was also a student research competition and an associated poster session  .  
 APLAS is organized by the Asian Association for Foundation of Software (AAFS)  , founded by Asian researchers in cooperation with many researchers from Europe and the USA. Past APLAS symposiums were held in Auckland (’22), Chicago (’21), Fukuoka (’20), Bali (’19), Wellington (’18), Suzhou (’17), Hanoi (’16), Pohang (’15), Singapore (’14), Melbourne (’13), Kyoto (’12), Kenting (’11), Shanghai (’10), Seoul (’09), Bangalore (’08), Singapore (’07), Sydney (’06), Tsukuba (’05), Taipei (’04) and Beijing (’03) after three informal workshops.  
 Conference Proceedings   
 Proceedings of APLAS 2023 is published by Springer as part of Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS), volume 14405.  
 Springer provides free access to the conference proceedings for APLAS participants until 31 December 2023, through the following link:

  2023-09-21 The proceedings are now available.    
 2023-07-10: Conference Preliminary Program is published   
 2023-04-24: A new conference poster is available   
 2023-04-01: We would like to inform you that we have decided to open the second round of submissions for the 15th Asian Conference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems (ACIIDS 2023), with a new deadline of April 16, 2023.  
  This decision is due to the fact that the interval between ACIIDS 2022 (Nov. 2022) and ACIIDS 2023 (July 2023) is much shorter than a year, and we have received many requests from authors to give them more time to prepare their works.  
  The review process for papers that have already been submitted will proceed as scheduled, and the submission deadline extension will not affect the review process. However, the acceptance decisions for both rounds of submissions will be announced at the same time, on May 30, 2023  .   
 2023-03-15: Deadline for Paper submission has been extended to March 31, 2023    
 2023-03-01: Deadline for Paper submission has been extended to March 14, 2023    
 2023-02-15: Deadline for Paper submission has been extended to February 28, 2023    
 2022-12-21: PHUKET GRACELAND RESORT & SPA is the ACIIDS 2023 conference venue    
 2022-12-16: ACIIDS 2023 website has launched

  About ACL  
  
 What is the ACL and what is Computational Linguistics?  
 The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the premier international scientific and professional society for people working on computational problems involving human language, a field often referred to as either computational linguistics or natural language processing (NLP). The association was founded in 1962, originally named the Association for Machine Translation and Computational Linguistics (AMTCL), and became the ACL in 1968. Activities of the ACL include the holding of an annual meeting each summer and the sponsoring of the journal Computational Linguistics, published by MIT Press; this conference and journal are the leading publications of the field. For more information, see: https://www.aclweb.org/. ​  
 What is Computational Linguistics?  
 Computational linguistics is the scientific study of language from a computational perspective. Computational linguists are interested in providing computational models of various kinds of linguistic phenomena. These models may be “knowledge-based” (“hand-crafted”) or “data-driven” (“statistical” or “empirical”). Work in computational linguistics is in some cases motivated from a scientific perspective in that one is trying to provide a computational explanation for a particular linguistic or psycholinguistic phenomenon; and in other cases the motivation may be more purely technological in that one wants to provide a working component of a speech or natural language system. Indeed, the work of computational linguists is incorporated into many working systems today, including speech recognition systems, text-to-speech synthesizers, automated voice response systems, web search engines, text editors, language instruction materials, to name just a few.

  Please note that the deadline to submit the final version of your paper is December 2, 2024.  
 This year’s conference was a great success, thanks to the quality of the papers presented and the outstanding efforts of the authors, special session organizers, session chairs, and invited speakers. We look forward to seeing you again in 2025!  
  Conference Presentation/Publication Policy  
 The proceedings of the Asilomar conference are meant to be a written record of the presentations provided at the conference. In other words, these proceedings are not a medium for general publication of scientific results; rather, they serve a more specific and narrow purpose which is to summarize the discussions that occurred during the Conference.  
 It is the long-term Conference policy to restrict publication in the proceedings to papers which were presented live  at the conference by one of the registered  authors of the paper who is physically present at the conference. There is no exception to this policy.  
 No more than 4 papers (combination of invited and regular) papers per author or co-author will be accepted for presentation at the conference or published in the proceedings.  
 The conference executive committee and IEEE reserve the right to exclude a final paper submission from inclusion in the conference proceedings, if the final paper submission does not meet conference or IEEE standards for scope and/or quality.  
  The Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers is a yearly Conference held on the Asilomar Grounds in Pacific Grove CA, USA. The IEEE Signal Processing Society is a technical co-sponsor. It provides a forum for presenting recent and novel work in various areas of theoretical and applied signal processing.  
 General areas of interest to the forum include:  
 Architectures & Implementation 
  Array Signal Processing 
  Biomedical Signal & Image Processing 
  Communication Systems 
  MIMO Communications & Signal Processing 
  Networks & Graphs 
  Signal Processing & Adaptive Systems 
  Machine Learning & Data Analytics 
  Speech, Image & Video Processing 
   
 Recent meetings have presented a wide array of work ranging from results in MIMO communications, array processing, low dimensional signal models, blind source separation, tensor models, stochastic optimization, online and distributed learning, and signal processing over graphs to applications of signal processing in control, wireless communications, financial engineering, smart grids, biological systems, medical imaging, and big data.

   CURRENT CONFERENCE  
  CAADRIA 202  5  
  22 — 29 MARCH 2025  
  Tokyo    

  The Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA) promotes teaching and research in CAAD in Asia, and has members on six continents.  
 It organizes an annual conference, the first of which was held in 1996 in Hong Kong. Since then, 20 conferences have been held in Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand. The conferences provide an opportunity for teachers, students, researchers, and practitioners to meet each other and learn about the latest research in the field. The proceedings of the conferences are available both online and in research libraries around the world.  
 CAADRIA was founded with the following objectives:  
 To facilitate the dissemination of information about CAAD among Asian schools of architecture, planning, engineering, and building sciences. 
  To encourage the exchange of staff, students, experience, courseware, and software among schools. 
  To identify research and develop needs in CAAD education and to initiate collaboration to satisfy them. 
  To promote research and teaching in CAAD that enhances creativity rather than production. 
  CAADRIA is one of the four founding organizations of the International Journal of Architectural Computing (IJAC), and supervises one issue each year. IJAC is published by Multi-Science in both paper and electronic versions.

 ARCHITECTURAL INFORMATICS  
 30th International Conference of the Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia  
 https://caadria2025.org   
  The concepts of architecture and cities are historically intrinsic to human civilization, as a consciousness of mankind’s need to construct artificial environments. However, decades after the advent of computers, we are now reconsidering their existence against the backdrop of the rapid expansion and evolution of information technology and its profound impact on industry, the economy, daily life, and society.  
 The quantum acceleration of information processing and communication has had a profound impact on the design of all kinds of artifacts, production techniques, management systems, and usage patterns, and has already surpassed the traditional concept of design and its support methods. By considering social activities and human organizations as forms of information processing, we can reconsider architecture and cities as information systems that have been constructed, accumulated and acted upon. Viewing architecture and cities through this lens suggests that real and virtual spaces should not be seen as opposing entities, but rather as complementary components within a unified system.  
 In other words, information may be architecture. With “Architectural Informatics” as the theme of CAADRIA’s 30th anniversary, we would like to reexamine the fundamental existence of architecture in the age of information technology.

  MS Word template 
   
 Submissions should be made via Easychair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ace23   
 RESEARCH PAPERS   
 Papers on research and innovations may be in the context of formal courses or self-directed learning; they may involve, for example, introductory programming, service courses, capstone courses, specialist undergraduate or postgraduate topics, or industry-related short courses. We welcome submissions directed at issues of current and local importance, as well as topics of international interest. Such topics may include the transition from school to university, articulation between vocational and university education, quality management in teaching, teaching people from other cultures, globalisation, attracting and retaining female students, online, mobile and blended learning. Research papers would typically describe research questions, and address these through the careful presentation of methods, results, and limitations, while clearly stating the contribution of the work.  
 PRACTITIONER PAPERS   
 In addition to research papers, ACE provides the opportunity for teachers to demonstrate new educational tools, and to share interesting teaching resources, assignments, and techniques that may be of broad interest to the community. We encourage the submission of papers that present interesting ways to teach challenging concepts, engaging activities that promote student learning, and compelling assignments. Practitioner papers would typically describe a computing education approach or tool, the context of its use, and present a rich reflection on how it worked in practice.  
 STUDENT PAPERS   
 Student authors (of research or practitioner papers) may be eligible for a CORE Student Research award. To qualify as a student paper:  
  
 the major contribution must be made by a student author, who must be listed as first author; and 
  at the time of submission, the authors must indicate that their paper is to be classified as a student paper, and provide a letter of confirmation from the student’s supervisor or Head of Department by email to the conference chairs (ace23@easychair.org). 
   
 REVIEW PROCESS   
 All research and practitioner papers will be fully refereed, using a double-blind reviewing process, by a minimum of three members of the Program Committee. Members of the Program Committee  are listed on the conference website.  
 CHAIRS   
 To contact the chairs, please use the conference EasyChair email address: ace23@easychair.org, or contact them directly:  
  
 Paul Denny, University of Auckland 
  Nicole Herbert, University of Tasmania 

 Guidelines for authors  

 Papers must be in English and must be original contributions that have not been published previously, nor submitted to other conferences or journals in parallel with this conference.  
 Papers must be between 5 and 10 pages long (inclusive of any references). Papers are required to conform to the formatting guidelines of the ACM Conference paper guides. Authors should use the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) – SIG Proceedings Template:  
  
 LaTeX template 
  MS Word template 
   
 If you are using Latex, use the “sigconf” style in documentclass (which is the default if you create a project using the LaTeX link above). Page length includes references. The accepted format for submissions is Portable Document Format (PDF). Microsoft Word and LaTeX template files are available at the website link above. We recommend using the LaTeX template where possible, but if you choose to use MS Word, then please use the Interim Template listed on the ACM conference proceedings page listed above.  
 By submitting to the conference, authors accept that they are aware of the Guidelines on Research Practice in Computer Science by the Computer Research and Education Association (CORE). In particular, authors are encouraged to review the points on authorship.  
 Please review the Guidelines for authors on this site, before submitting.  
 Double-blind reviewing requirements:  It is standard practice that identities of reviewers are not made known to authors. The double-blind review process extends this principle so that reviewers do not know the identity of authors. This process requires authors to refrain from identifying themselves in their own paper. Below are some guidelines for anonymising your paper.  
  
 If you are using the ACM template correctly, you can tell it to create an anonymous version of the pdf; this will take care of explicit mentions of the author names. 
  If you are not yet using the template (you should be!), in place of the usual author and address details, put “Author details suppressed” or something equivalent. Where there are more than three authors contributing to a paper, limit the number of author spaces to three in the anonymised version. 
  Refrain from references to your university or campus by name. If you feel that a description of your university is in some way salient to the paper, use generalities. For example, use "our University" instead of "Maintown University of Technology". 
  Avoid expressions like “In earlier work we …” followed by a citation of a paper authored by yourself. 
  If you have an acknowledgements section, omit it for the blind submission. 
  Do not link to webpages in your anonymised paper. 
  Once you have a pdf copy of your paper, see how well it is blinded. Some PDF creation software includes document properties such as the author name or institution. Some operating systems will show such document properties when the cursor hovers over the file name. Be especially careful to disguise or remove these properties. 
   
 In general, apply good judgement when preparing your submission, to maintain the integrity of the double-blind process. Submissions that allow the author to be identified may be returned to you for editing at short notice, or may be rejected outright.  
 Registration for ACSW:  At least one author of an accepted paper must register to attend ACSW. When submitting a paper, you will be asked to nominate who will be attending ACE and presenting the paper if it is accepted. Papers not presented at ACE will be withdrawn from the proceedings. Please see the ACSW site for registration.

 Mission  
 The Asia-Pacific Conference on Conceptual Modelling provides an annual forum for disseminating the results of innovative research in information modelling and related areas. Topics of conference vary from conceptual modeling research and practice to all related areas that are mentioned in prime essay  and scientific journals.  
 The amount, complexity and diversity of information held in computer systems are constantly on the increase, and so are the requirements and challenges to be met for useful access and manipulation of this information. Conceptual modelling is fundamental to the development of up-to-date information and knowledge-based systems. The conference series aims on bringing together experts from all areas of computer science and information systems with a common interest in the subject.  
 Upcoming Conference  
 The Tenth Asia-Pacific Conference on Conceptual Modelling (APCCM 2014)  will take place in Auckland, New Zealand from January 20th to 23rd, 2014.  
 The 2014 conference will be held as part of the Australasian Computer Science Week (ACSW 2014).
