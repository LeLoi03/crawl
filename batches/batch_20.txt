 ISSTA/ECOOP'23: Welcome to Seattle and logistics  
   
 Dear ISSTA/ECOOP 2023 participants,  
 We look forward to welcoming you to the joint conference next week.  
 Below are a number of logistical notes as well as guidelines for presenters. (For convenience, this and other communications will appear on the conference website as well.)  
 On behalf of the ISSTA/ECOOP 2023 organizing committee, welcome to Seattle!  
 René Just  
 Light Rail   
 The Seattle Light Rail system is a great option to get around the Seattle area and to the University of Washington. There is a station conveniently located at the SeaTac airport (from baggage claim, head up to 4th floor and use the skybridge to cross to the parking garage, and follow signs to Link Light Rail), and the line goes directly to downtown Seattle and the University of Washington. Light Rail and bus tickets can be easily purchased via the Transit GO Ticket app  or at ticket kiosks located in the station. Light Rail tickets are $7 for all day use, or $2.25 to $3.50 per one-way trip.  
 Bus   
 Seattle has extensive bus route systems. You can use Seattle Metro’s convenient Trip Planning site  to plan your route. Tickets can be purchased via the Transit GO Ticket app  or with $2.75 exact change when boarding the bus.  
 Parking on Campus   
 Paid parking is available on the University of Washington campus. If you are driving to campus, it is recommended to factor in 20-30 minutes for finding parking and walking to your destinations, as the Allen and Gates buildings are 0.4 miles (0.6 km) from all parking garages. Information about parking fees can be found on ]UW’s Transportation]( https://transportation.uw.edu/park/visitor  ) website. Parking permits can be purchased at UW Gatehouses or by phone via the PayByPhone App  .  
 Addresses   
 Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science and Engineering (Allen Center) 185 E Stevens Way NE Seattle, WA 98195  
 Bill & Melinda Gates Center for Computer Science and Engineering (Gates Center) 3800 E Stevens Way NE Seattle, WA 98195  
 (The two buildings are adjacent, though the street numbers may suggest otherwise.)  
 Registration   
 Please pick up your conference badge and registration package at the registration desk in the Allen Center. Just enter the building through the sliding doors, and the reception desk will be in front of you. The registration desk will be staffed between 8am and 5pm, Monday through Thursday, and between 8am and noon on Friday.  
 Technical Program   
 You can find a program overview and details for the entire week on the ISSTA/ECOOP website  . (The programs on the ISSTA and ECOOP website instances are in sync with the overall program, but provide a view that is tailored to each conference.)  
 Guidelines for presenters   
 In-person presentations:  Presentation slots are 15 minutes (unless differently indicated by your track chair). Please follow the instructions provided to you by your track chair to allow for enough time for Q&A. Please go to your allocated room 15 minutes before the session start time to meet with the Session Chair (see technical program), review the pronunciation of your name, and familiarize yourself with the room and A/V set up, if needed (see Rehearsal and equipment check). You are expected to use your own laptop for presentations, which needs to be connected via HDMI. Some dongles (USB-C) may be available but bring your own adapter if needed. For ISSTA and ECOOP presentations, the A/V system is set up such that it will capture the screen, presenter, and audio, which will be streamed for remote participants via Zoom. Note that you do not need to join a Zoom meeting, simply plug in your device and use the wireless microphone provided. 
  ISSTA-Online presentations:  Presentation slots are 10 minutes. Prepare for 7.5 minutes of presentation and 2.5 minutes of Q&A. You will be required to present via Zoom. Please join the zoom meeting for your online session 15 minutes before the session start time. The zoom meeting details will be shared separately before the main conference. To avoid complications, please install the latest Zoom application on your computer and do not present via a web browser. Make sure your Zoom setup is working properly by running the Zoom audio/video test before joining the call. If your presentation contains any audio, you must enable the sharing of audio when sharing your screen. When you have finished your presentation, please stop sharing your screen and mute your microphone. 
  Posters:  Please set up your poster on Tuesday between 3pm and 3:30pm in the Allen Atrium (in time for the first poster session that starts at 3:30pm). All posters can remain in the Allen Atrium until Thursday evening. Easels, poster boards (32x40 inches), and clips will be provided. 
  Rehearsal and equipment check:  We have reserved room G04 for presentation rehearsal and equipment testing. The A/V setup is identical in all conference rooms. If your set up works in G04, it should work everywhere. 
  Need Help?   
 Signs and student volunteers (in purple shirts) will guide you and help you find your way around campus. If you need additional help or support, please let a staff member at the registration desk know or email April and René.  

 Online sessions and Zoom links  
   
 Dear ISSTA/ECOOP 2023 participants,  
 Below are four meeting links for joining the conference remotely, grouped by conference room. These links are valid for the entire week, and each meeting will start at 10:15am (PDT) on any given day. Please see the online program  for details regarding sessions, rooms, and presentation order.  
 For online presenters   
 Please make sure to virtually join your meeting room 15 minutes prior to the start of your session to connect with your session chair and a student volunteer in the (physical) conference room.  
 For in-person participants   
 All remote presentations are streamed in the physical conference rooms (in the order as listed in the program). In-person participants will be able to ask questions using a wireless microphone and do not need to connect to Zoom.

  The ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA) is the leading research symposium on software testing and analysis, bringing together academics, industrial researchers, and practitioners to exchange new ideas, problems, and experience on how to analyze and test software systems.  
 New for ISSTA 2023: Dual submission deadlines   
 ISSTA 2023 will feature two submission deadlines: An early submission deadline (November 10, 2022) and a regular submission deadline (February 16, 2023). You can choose to submit at either deadline, but papers submitted to the first deadline may  receive a chance to submit a major revision  of the initial submission to the regular deadline, addressing the reviewer comments. Papers submitted to the regular deadline will be decided using only the traditional paper outcomes of accept or reject.

 Call for Papers  
  
 ISSTA invites three kinds of submissions. The clear majority of submissions is expected to be “Research Papers”, but submissions that best fit the description of “Experience Papers” or “Replicability Studies” should be submitted as such.  
 Research Papers   
 Authors are invited to submit research papers describing original contributions in testing or analysis of computer software. Papers describing original theoretical or empirical research, new techniques, methods for emerging systems, in-depth case studies, infrastructures of testing and analysis, or tools are welcome.  
 Experience Papers   
 Authors are invited to submit experience papers describing a significant experience in applying software testing and analysis methods or tools and should carefully identify and discuss important lessons learned so that other researchers and/or practitioners can benefit from the experience. Of special interest are experience papers that report on industrial applications of software testing and analysis methods or tools.  
 Replicability Studies   
 ISSTA would like to encourage researchers to replicate results from previous papers. A replicability study must go beyond simply re-implementing an algorithm and/or re-running the artifacts provided by the original paper. It should at the very least apply the approach to new, significantly broadened inputs. Particularly, replicability studies are encouraged to target techniques that previously were evaluated only on proprietary subject programs or inputs. A replicability study should clearly report on results that the authors were able to replicate as well as on aspects of the work that were not replicable. In the latter case, authors are encouraged to make an effort to communicate or collaborate with the original paper’s authors to determine the cause for any observed discrepancies and, if possible, address them (e.g., through minor implementation changes). We explicitly encourage authors to not focus on a single paper/artifact only, but instead to perform a comparative experiment of multiple related approaches.  
 In particular, replicability studies should follow the ACM guidelines on replicability (different team, different experimental setup): The measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team, a different measuring system, in a different location on multiple trials. For computational experiments, this means that an independent group can obtain the same result using artifacts which they develop completely independently. This means that it is also insufficient to focus on reproducibility (i.e., different team, same experimental setup) alone. Replicability Studies will be evaluated according to the following standards:  
 Depth and breadth of experiments 
  Clarity of writing 
  Appropriateness of conclusions 
  Amount of useful, actionable insights 
  Availability of artifacts 
  We expect replicability studies to clearly point out the artifacts the study is built on, and to submit those artifacts to artifact evaluation (see below). Artifacts evaluated positively will be eligible to obtain the prestigious Results Reproduced badge.  
 Dual Submission Deadlines and Major Revisions   
 ISSTA 2023 features two submission deadlines: An early submission deadline (November 10, 2022) and a regular submission deadline (February 16, 2023). The instructions in this call apply to both deadlines. You can choose to submit at either deadline, but only papers submitted to the first deadline may  receive a chance to submit a major revision  of the initial submission to the regular deadline, addressing the reviewer comments. Papers submitted to the regular deadline will be decided using only the traditional paper outcomes of accept or reject.  
 Submission Guidelines   
 Submissions must be original and should not have been published previously or be under consideration for publication while being evaluated for ISSTA. Authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism  and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions  .  
 Research Papers, Experience Papers, and Replicability Studies should be at most 10 pages in length, with at most 2 additional pages for references. Experience papers and replicability studies should clearly specify their category in the paper title upon submission, e.g., “XXX (Experience Paper)”. All authors should use the official “ACM Master article template”, which can be obtained from the ACM Proceedings Template  pages. Latex users should use the “sigconf” option, as well as the “review” (to produce line numbers for easy reference by the reviewers) and “anonymous” (omitting author names) options. To that end, the following Latex code can be placed at the start of the Latex document:  
 \documentclass[sigconf,review, anonymous]{acmart} \acmConference[ISSTA 2023]{ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis}{17-21 July, 2023}{Seattle, USA}   Submit your papers via the HotCRP ISSTA 2023 submission website  .  
 Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Authors will have an opportunity to respond to reviews during a rebuttal period. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation, quality of presentation and appropriate comparison to related work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as the PC chair may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The authors will have a chance to read the additional reviews and respond to them during the additional short response period. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for presentation at the conference.  
 Double-blind Reviewing   
 ISSTA 2023 will conduct double-blind reviewing. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. They should also ensure that any citations to related work by themselves are written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work”.  
 Double-blind reviewing should not hinder the usual communication of results. But, during the review period, please don’t broadcast the work on social media. Also, to the extent possible, consider not publishing preprints of your work during or right before the review period. If the authors have already published a version of their paper to arXiv or similar sites, we request authors to use a different title for their submission, so that author names are not inadvertently disclosed, e.g., via a notification on Google Scholar.  
 Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chair by email.  
 Open Science Policy   
 ISSTA has adopted an open science policy. Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and that empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability.  
 Upon submission, authors are asked to make their data available to the program committee (via upload of anonymized supplemental material or a link to an anonymized private or public repository) or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. While sharing such a repository is not mandatory for submission or acceptance, this information will be passed to the program committee to inform its decision. Furthermore, authors are asked to indicate whether they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance.  
 Authors Take Note:   
 The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

 Call for Workshop Proposals -  
  32nd ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA'2023)  
   
 Date: Tue, 31 Jan 2023 22:35:03 +0100 To: ecoop-info@ecoop.org From: Pascal Weisenburger <pascal.weisenburger@unisg.ch> Subject: [ECOOP-Info] Call for ECOOP/ISSTA 2023 Workshop Proposals The 2023 editions of the co-located ECOOP ( https://2023.ecoop.org  ) and ISSTA ( https://conf.researchr.org/home/issta-2023  ) conferences, taking place from July 17th till July 21th 2023 in Seattle, intend to host a diverse offering of workshops bringing together academics, industrial researchers, and practitioners to exchange new ideas, problems, and experiences. The workshop chairs are reviewing submitted workshop proposals on a rolling basis until **February 12th**. Submission link: https://forms.gle/6bn3TUoveiegzAtb9  We hope that ECOOP/ISSTA and its co-located workshops will form the ideal occasion to meet each other again. Topics for workshops may include, but are not limited to, the theory design, implementation, optimization, testing, and analysis of models programs and programming languages. In particular, while the OO in ECOOP has traditionally stood for "object-oriented", these days the scope of ECOOP is much broader and encompasses the Programming Languages field as a whole. Workshops will run before, during, and after the program of the main conference. To submit a proposal for an ECOOP/ISSTA workshop, please complete the online application form linked to below. After submitting, you will receive an automated email confirmation of your submission and, within at most four weeks, a formal response notifying you if the workshop has been accepted for ECOOP/ISSTA. Proposals will be reviewed on a rolling basis until February 12th, 2023. Submission link: https://forms.gle/6bn3TUoveiegzAtb9  Each workshop must conform to the following conditions: (1) The workshop's website must be live within two weeks of notification of the workshop's acceptance and include relevant information about the organizers and any call for contributions. (2) Final notification dates for workshop contributions must be at least 3 days before the early registration period ends. For more information, see https://2023.ecoop.org/track/ecoop-2023-workshops  and https://conf.researchr.org/track/issta-2023/issta-2023-workshops  Please contact the workshop co-chairs, Brittany Johnson-Matthews (johnsonb@gmu.edu) and Sebastian Erdweg (erdweg@uni-mainz.de), if you have any questions.    
 Call for Artifact Evaluation Committee -  
  32nd ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA'2023)  
   
 From: Alessio Gambi <alessio.gambi@fh-krems.ac.at> To: "SEWORLD@SIGSOFT.ORG" <SEWORLD@SIGSOFT.ORG> Subject: [SEWORLD] ISSTA 2023 Call for Artifact Evaluation Committee Date: Fri, 20 Jan 2023 13:37:11 +0000 ISSTA 2023 Call for Artifact Evaluation Committee Research artifacts denote digital objects created by the authors of a research article to be used as part of their study or generated by their experiments [1]. The Artifact Evaluation (AE) is crucial in ensuring reproducibility i.e., validating the paper's results using the provided artifacts and reusability, i.e., extending existing artifacts or using them in a different context or for other use cases. The AE process is a community service that supports authors of accepted papers in providing more substantial supplements to their papers in the form of high-quality and openly available artifacts [2]. That is why we are soliciting candidate AE Reviewers for the 32nd ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA 2023) [3]. Being an AE Reviewer, you might try state-of-the-art research prototypes and provide invaluable feedback to researchers and practitioners submitting the artifacts. Additionally, you will have the chance to connect and interact with those leading researchers and practitioners and be more involved in the fantastic ISSTA community. Hence, do not wait any longer and apply to be selected as a reviewer for the ISSTA 2023 AE Committee! In summary: - Workload: We expect AE Reviewers to review 2-3 artifacts between May 18, 2023, to June 18, 2023. - Qualifications/Profile: Although none of the following is a hard requirement, AE Reviewers typically are senior Ph.D. students postdocs, and practitioners who have participated in the AE process as authors or reviewers. - Application procedure: Complete the online self-nomination form at https://forms.gle/BQs3W52fDeDeUAP87  before February 15, 2023. - Final Remarks: We aim for a diverse reviewing committee and encourage members from underrepresented groups in our field to nominate themselves. However, note that a self-nomination is no guarantee to be invited to serve on the AEC.

  32nd ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA'2023)  
   
 From: "Fraser, Gordon" <Gordon.Fraser@Uni-Passau.De> To: "seworld@sigsoft.org" <seworld@sigsoft.org> Subject: [SEWORLD] CFP: 32nd ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA 2023) -- Dual Deadlines Date: Thu, 15 Sep 2022 22:05:59 +0000 CALL FOR PAPERS 32nd ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA 2023) Seattle, Washington, USA - July 17-21, 2023. https://conf.researchr.org/home/issta-2023  The ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA) is the leading research symposium on software testing and analysis, bringing together academics, industrial researchers, and practitioners to exchange new ideas, problems, and experience on how to analyze and test software systems. 2023 will mark the 32nd edition of ISSTA. New for ISSTA 2023: Dual submission deadlines =================== ISSTA 2023 will feature two submission deadlines: An early submission deadline (November 10, 2022) and a regular submission deadline (February 16, 2023). You can choose to submit to either deadline. Papers submitted to the early deadline may receive a chance to address the reviewer comments and resubmit a major revision of the initial submission to the regular deadline. Papers submitted to the regular deadline will receive an outcome of accept or reject. Both submission deadlines involve an author-response period. Technical Papers =================== Authors are invited to submit research papers describing original contributions in testing or analysis of computer systems. Papers describing original theoretical or empirical research, new techniques methods for emerging systems, in-depth case studies, infrastructures of testing and analysis, or tools are welcome. Experience Papers =================== Authors are invited to submit experience papers describing a significant experience in applying testing and analysis methods or tools and should carefully identify and discuss important lessons learned so that other researchers and/or practitioners can benefit from the experience. Of special interest are experience papers that report on industrial applications of testing and analysis methods or tools. Replication Studies =================== ISSTA welcomes replication studies of previous papers. A replication study must go beyond simply re-implementing an algorithm and/or re-running the artifacts provided by the original papers. It should assess generalizability, e.g., by applying the approach to new significantly broadened subject programs or inputs. Particularly encouraged are replication studies that evaluate approaches previously evaluated only on proprietary subject programs or inputs. A replication study should clearly report on results that the authors were able to replicate as well as on aspects of the work that were not replicable. In the latter case, authors are encouraged to make an effort to communicate or collaborate with the original paper's authors to determine the cause for any observed discrepancies and, if possible, address them (e.g., through an analysis of what factors affect generalizability). Submissions Guideline =================== Submissions must be original and should not have been published previously or be under consideration for publication while being evaluated for ISSTA. Authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions. Research and Experience Papers as well as Reproducibility Studies should be at most 10 pages in length, with at most 2 additional pages for references. All papers must be prepared in ACM Conference Format [1]. Submit your papers via the HotCRP ISSTA 2023 submission website [2]. Double-anonymous Reviewing =================== ISSTA 2023 will conduct double-anonymous reviewing. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. They should also ensure that any citations to related work by themselves are written in third person, that is, "the prior work of XYZ" as opposed to "our prior work". Double-anonymous reviewing should not hinder the usual communication of results. But, during the review period, please don't broadcast the work on social media. Also to the extent possible, consider not publishing preprints of your work during or right before the review period. Authors with further questions on double-anonymous reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chair by email. Supplementary Material =================== Upon submission, authors are asked to make their data available to the program committee (via upload of anonymized supplemental material or a link to an anonymized private or public repository) or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. While sharing such a repository is not mandatory for submission or acceptance, this information will be passed to the program committee to inform its decision. Furthermore, authors are asked to indicate whether they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. Important Dates =============== - First round paper submission: November 10, 2022 - First round author response: December 20-22, 2022 - First round notification: January 16, 2023 - Second round paper submission: February 16, 2023 - Second round author response: April 11-13, 2023 - Second round notification: May 3, 2023 More Information ================ ISSTA 2023 also features tracks for tools and demos, posters workshops, a doctoral symposium, and artefact evaluation. For additional information, please visit the ISSTA 2023 website [3].

 Keynotes  

 Keynote 1 – Democratizing Urban Data Exploration  
 The growing ability to collect data from urban environments through a variety of sensors, coupled with a push towards openness and transparency by governments, has resulted in the availability of a plethora of spatio-temporal datasets. By analyzing these data, we have the opportunity to better understand how different urban components behave and interact over space and time, and obtain insights to make city operations more efficient, inform policies and planning, and improve the quality of life for residents. While there have been successful efforts in this direction, they are few and far between because analyzing urban data often requires a staggering amount of work: from identifying and wrangling relevant data, to performing exploratory analyses and creating predictive models. These tasks are often out of reach for domain experts that lack training in computing and data science. In this talk, I will discuss work we have done at the NYU Visualization, Imaging and Data Analysis (VIDA) Center that aims to democratize data exploration and empower domain experts to crack the code of cities by freely exploring urban data. I will present methods and systems which combine data management, analytics, and visualization to increase the level of interactivity, scalability, and usability for spatio-temporal data analyses.

She develops methods and systems that enable a wide range of users to obtain trustworthy insights from data. This spans topics in large-scale data analysis and integration, visualization, machine learning, provenance management, and web information discovery, as well as different application areas, including urban analytics, predictive modeling, and computational reproducibility. She is an active member of the database and Web research communities, with over 250 technical papers (including 12 award-winning papers), several open-source systems, and 12 U.S. patents.

 Keynote 2 – Harnessing Spatiotemporal Data for Pandemic Preparedness with Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs)  
 The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the importance of data for pandemic preparedness, in particular, human mobility and social interactions data that are strongly tied to the spatiotemporal spread of infectious diseases. Such data are sensitive, thus privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) become key enablers for data-driven pandemic preparedness. In this talk, I will review the landscape of PETs and their applicability for spatiotemporal data collection and analysis for pandemic preparedness. I will then highlight some of our recent and ongoing related efforts: 1) privacy-enhanced mobility trackingand contact tracing; 2) mobility data collection with local differential privacy to enable accurate mobility pattern analysis; 3) mobility data synthesization to enable downstream epidemic modeling (and other applications), and 4) federated learning to enable modeling on data distributed across institutions (and our support of the recent US-UK federated learning challenge for pandemic). I will conclude with a set of open research questions.

 ISSDQ  
 In this symposium we aim to address urban issues of spatial data quality, as they relate to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and in the presence of big data. Deep learning requires high quality data to result in high quality results. In order to tune the workshop, we like to focus on one specific study area, and for the GSW 2021 the target is the city of Dubai, being a modern city with an old core that is rapidly developing and where both 2- and 3-dimensional spatial information can be collected. Such an urban area is of interest in scaling from the household through the neighborhood to the whole city and its environment, within-city spatial variability and uses of data for decision support. In the frame of the workshop also the big data companies, such as google, will be invited to participate. We further see scope for having a stakeholder event where typical governmental and planning agencies will be invited. Finally, we aim to have specific attention to ethical issues of spatial data quality, like questioning the fitness for specific uses.

 Special Issue on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation (ISSAC 2023)  
 Following the 48th International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation, ISSAC 2023, held in Tromsø, Norway July 24-27, 2023, we are pleased to announce a special issue of the Journal of Symbolic Computation ( https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-symbolic-computation  ) dedicated to this event.  
   
  We are inviting submissions of high-quality original research papers that showcase significant contributions to the field. The focus of this special issue will be on works presented at ISSAC 2023, including papers, tutorials, plenary talks, short communications, and software presentations. We encourage substantial additions to these presentations, such as significant generalizations or comprehensive implementation reports. However, we also welcome submissions that closely relate to the topics discussed at ISSAC 2023.  
   
  Guest editors: Marianne Akian (INRIA Saclay Île-de-France and CMAP, France) 
  Gema Diaz-Toca (University of Murcia, Spain)

  Manuscript submission information:  
  Tentative Schedule: Submission Open Date: September 15, 2023 
  Submission Deadline: December 15, 2023 
  Editorial Acceptance Deadline: April 2024 
  Authors are strongly encouraged to follow Elsevier's LaTeX instructions ( https://www.elsevier.com/latex  ) and submit the resulting pdf. Final versions will have to be sent with tex sources. All submitted papers will be refereed according to the usual JSC refereeing process. Submission is via EasyChair, at the website: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jscissac23   
   
  The introduction of the paper must succinctly explain the problem considered, explicitly describe its importance, the contribution of the paper, how it is related to the existing literature. In addition and when applicable, the authors should explain in a cover letter to the editors and reviewers what the significant improvements and enhancements are, compared to the related ISSAC 2023 paper.  
   
  Since there is no severe page limit, the paper must be complete, with all issues be carefully discussed, all relevant references properly cited and discussed, all theorems rigorously proved with (reasonable) details, all important definitions/theorems/algorithms illustrated by well chosen examples, all feedbacks from the conference's referee process addressed.

 The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are global grand challenges that are inherently complex, multi-faceted and socially embedded (Corbett & Mellouli, 2017). The SDGs inevitably encounter tensions between their design and implementation, representing design-reality gaps (Pradhan et al., 2022; Heeks, 2020a; Dennehy et al., 2014). While optimism is relatively high about the role of technology and analytics in the context of global development (Smidt & Jokonya, 2022), significant learning remains about how best to use them as ‘platforms that mediate development’ (Heeks 2020b). Further, despite the efforts made by scholars to advance understanding about the role of technology and analytics for global development (e.g., Dwivedi et al., 2021; Khene & Masiero, 2022; Masiero & Arvidsson, 2021), a concerted effort within and between academic disciplines, policy-makers, practitioners, and the intended beneficiaries of the SDGs will help to discover and create better ways to achieve the SDGs. ISTAS23 aims to bring together contributions from a variety of perspectives, disciplines, and communities for the advancement of knowledge regarding Technology and Analytics for Global Development. We invite participation from academics and practitioners who are engaged in current debates about the role and significance of technology and analytics, and who are interested in topics related to sustainability, ethics, equity, and social values for global development.

 Title  : Asynchronous Temporal Equilibrium Logic 
 Abstract  : Temporal Answer Set Programming is concerned with extending the stable models semantics of logic programs to a temporal setting, which may by fruitfully used for applications such as planning and reasoning about actions. The logical characerisation of stable models in terms of Equilibrium logic, in which models from the (monotonic) intermediate logic of Here-and-There are selected under a minimality condition, lends itself for defining a stable models variant of linear temporal logic (LTL) in terms of Temporal Equilibrium Logic (TEL), which selects traces from Temporal Here-and-There (THT) under a minimality condition that traces of the same length pointwise. We consider a stricter selection, which we call asynchronous TEL, where a trace can be smaller than another by making less atoms true or by reducing the number of transitions in the trace. In a way, the latter amounts to a contraction of the larger trace. We illustrate the effect on examples and and explore some properties of the notion, which may be used for summarisation and compact example construction, for instance. This is joint work with Pedro Cabalar from the University of A Coruna. 
 Bio  : Thomas Eiter is a professor in the Faculty of Informatics at the Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien), Austria, where he obtained his PhD in 1991 and heads the Knowledge-Based Systems Group and the Institute of Logic and Computation. He has been active in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, where he made contributions  to knowledge representation and reasoning, e.g. in his work on reasoning with incomplete and/or inconsistent information, contextual reasoning, combining rules and ontologies, and to declarative problem solving. Eiter is an ACM Fellow, a Fellow of the European Association for AI, and Member of the Austrian and the European Academy of Sciences, respectively. 
 Laura Nenzi  , University of Trieste, Italy 
 Title  : Learning Temporal Logic Formulas from Time-series Data 
 Abstract  : The availability of data has spurred the utilization of machine learning techniques for system analysis. While these methods excel in complex, high-dimensional scenarios and generate powerful black-box models, they often lack uncertainty measures and fail to fully understand the underlying mechanisms. This limitation becomes especially crucial in safety-critical systems, where failures can be costly. Therefore, designers must comprehend system phenomena and extract meaningful knowledge from the data. To tackle this challenge, recent research has explored the application of learning Temporal Logic (TL) formulae as a means of extracting human-interpretable information. TL offers precise formal formulae that are easily comprehensible to humans and provides verification algorithms that can automatically evaluate the fulfillment of desired properties. In this talk, we provide an overview of recent advancements in this field, with a specific focus on learning Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is particularly well-suited for expressing properties related to real-time trajectories. We delve into supervised and semi-supervised learning problems, highlighting the utility of TL formulae, e.g. for anomaly detection. Additionally, we show how the consideration of spatial aspects in system behavior can be accomplished by using STREL, an extension of STL with a number of spatial operators. 
 Bio  : Laura Nenzi is an expert in formal verification. Her research is mainly focused on the design of temporal logics to specify and monitor large-scale spatially distributed systems. In the last few years, she is investigating the combination of formal verification with Bayesian and machine learning techniques. She is also working on explainable AI, designing methodologies for learning formal specifications from data. Since November 2021, she is an Assistant Professor (with tenure-track) at the Department of Engineering and Architecture at the University of Trieste, Italy.

 CALL FOR PAPERS   
 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES   
 The Symposium on Dependable Software Engineering: Theories, Tools and Applications (SETTA) 2023 will be held in Nanjing on November 27-29, 2023.  
 Formal methods emerged as an important area in computer science and software engineering about half a century ago. An international community has formed researching, developing and teaching formal theories, techniques and tools for software modeling, specification, design and verification. However, the impact of formal methods on the quality and improvement of software systems is, in practice, lagging behind. This is for instance reflected by the challenges in applying formal techniques and tools to engineering large-scale systems such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Internet-of-Things (IoT), Enterprise Systems, Cloud-Based Systems, and so forth.  
 The purpose of the SETTA symposium is to bring international researchers together to exchange research results and ideas on bridging the gap between formal methods and software engineering. SETTA will show research interests and results from different groups so as to initiate interest-driven research collaboration. It is aiming at academic excellence and its objective is to become a flagship conference on formal software engineering in China.  
 To achieve these goals and contribute to the sustainability of the formal methods research, it is important for the symposium to attract young researchers into the community. Thus, this symposium particularly encourages the participation of young researchers and students.  
 Authors are invited to submit papers on original research, industrial applications, or position papers proposing challenges in fundamental research and technology. The latter two types of submissions are expected to contribute to the development of formal methods and applications thereof in software engineering. This is done by either substantiating the advantages of integrating formal methods into the development cycle or through delineating the need for research by demonstrating weaknesses of existing technologies, especially when addressing new application domains.  
 All submissions must be in the PDF format. Papers should be written in English. Submitted papers must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere.  
   
 TOPICS   
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Requirements specification and analysis 
  Formalisms for modeling, design and implementation 
  Model checking, theorem proving, and decision procedures 
  Scalable approaches to formal system analysis 
  Formal approaches to simulation, run-time verification, and testing 
  Integration of formal methods into software engineering practice 
  Contract-based engineering of components, systems, and systems of systems 
  Formal and engineering aspects of software evolution and maintenance 
  Parallel and multicore programming 
  Embedded, real-time, hybrid, probabilistic, and cyber-physical systems 
  Mixed-critical applications and systems 
  Formal aspects of service-oriented and cloud computing 
  Safety, reliability, robustness, and fault-tolerance 
  Dependability of smart software and systems 
  Empirical analysis techniques and integration with formal methods 
  Applications and industrial experience reports 
  Software tools to assist the construction or analysis of software systems

 ABOUT SETTA   
 Formal methods emerged as a disciple area in computer science and software engineering half a century ago. An international community is formed researching, developing and teaching formal theories, techniques and tools for software modeling, specification, design and verification.  
 However, the impact of the theories, techniques and tools on the improvement of qualities of the daily used software systems is far from being convincing to software engineering practitioners. The gap between the development of formal methods and the advances in software technologies is not being seen becoming narrower. More precisely, the relation between formal methods and software technologies is not clearly understood.  
 This is clearly reflected by the challenges in application of formal techniques and tool in engineering large-scale systems with multi-dimensional complexities. Large systems include Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Networks of Things, Enterprise Systems, Cloud-Based Systems, etc.  
 This background is the motivation of this Symposium on Foundations, Practice and Trends in Formal Software Engineering Methods. The theme of the symposium is to promote research sharing, exchange of ideas and discussions on  
 Theories, techniques, tools and their applications, the understanding on their impacts, weakness and what practical problems in software design they can solve effectively. 
  Relations and common foundations of difference theoretical frameworks and their techniques so as to scale up their application to handle complex system design and verification; 
  "Big and bold" ideas about how to make it more relevant to engineering practitioners by advancing formal methods research and development and improving education; 
  Research and experiments on domain specific applications of formal techniques and tools. 
   
 The program of the symposium  will consist of  
 regular presentations on research findings related to the above thematic points, 
  reports of progress of ongoing research and/or projects, 
  position papers that propose challenges in fundamental research and technology development, 
  industrial application cases and experiences of application of formal methods, 
  presentations from PhD students on their research. 
   
 The purpose of the symposium  is to bring international researchers to exchange research results and ideas with the Chinese computer science and software engineering community. It is the hope to develop understanding of the research of different groups so as to build up closer and interest-driven research collaboration. The symposium is aiming at its academic excellence and its objective is to grow up to become a flagship conference on formal software engineering conference in China.  
 To achieve these goals and contribute to the sustainability of the formal methods research, it is important for the symposium to attract young researchers into the community. Thus, this symposium encourages participation of young researchers and students.

46. MTNS_3 conference:
MTNS History    MTNS, the International Symposium on the Mathematical Theory of Networks and Systems is a major conference in the general area of mathematical systems theory. The symposium is interdisciplinary and attracts mathematicians, engineers and researchers working in all aspects of systems theory. The symposium is organized every two years and traditionally covers areas involving a wide range of research directions in mathematical systems, networks and control theory. Mathematical methods which play a role in the areas mentioned above stem from a broad range of fields of pure and applied mathematics, including ordinary and partial differential equations, real and complex analysis, numerical analysis, probability theory and stochastic analysis, operator theory, linear and commutative algebra as well as algebraic and differential geometry. There are a wide range of applications ranging from problems in biology, communications and mathematical finance to problems in chemical engineering, aerospace engineering and robotics. The meetings are scheduled by an international steering committee. The fourteen previous MTNS meetings were held in:  

 1973  : College Park, Maryland, USA, | 1975  : Montreal, Canada, 
 1977  : Lubbock, Texas, USA, | 1979  : Delft, Netherlands, 
 1981  : Santa Monica, California, USA, | 1983  : Beer Sheva, Israel, 
 1985  : Stockholm, Sweden, | 1987  : Phoenix, Arizona, USA, 
 1989  : Amsterdam, Netherlands, | 1991  : Kobe, Japan, 
 1993  : Regensburg, Germany, | 1996  : St. Louis, Missouri, USA, 
 1998  : Padova, Italy, | 2000  : Perpignan, France. |

 A Brief History of History-Determinism (Invited Talk)   
 Authors:  Karoliina Lehtinen  
  Abstract    
 Most nondeterministic automata models are more expressive, or at least more succinct, than their deterministic counterparts; however, this comes at a cost, as deterministic automata tend to have better algorithmic properties. History-deterministic automata are an intermediate model that allows a restricted form of nondeterminism: all nondeterministic choices must be resolvable on-the-fly, with only the knowledge of the word prefix read so far - as opposed to general nondeterminism, which allows for guessing the future of the word. History-deterministic automata combine some of the algorithmic benefits of determinism with some of the increased power of nondeterminism, thus enjoying (some of) the best of both worlds. History-determinism, as it is understood today, has its roots in several independently invented notions: Kupferman, Safra and Vardi’s automata recognising tree languages derived from word languages [Kupferman et al., 2006] (a notion that has been later referred to as automata that are good-for-trees [Udi Boker et al., 2013]), Henzinger and Piterman’s good-for-games automata [Thomas Henzinger and Nir Piterman, 2006], and Colcombet’s history-deterministic automata, introduced in his work on regular cost-automata [Colcombet, 2009]. In the ω-regular setting, where they were initially most studied, the notions of good-for-trees, good-for-games and history-determinism are equivalent, despite differences in their definitions. The key algorithmic appeal of these automata is that like deterministic automata, they have good compositional properties. This makes them particularly useful for applications such as reactive synthesis, where composition of games and automata is at the heart of effective solutions. Since then, history-determinism has received its fair share of attention, not least because of its relevance to synthesis. Indeed it turns out to be a natural and useful form of nondeterminism more broadly, and can be generalised to all sorts of different automata models: alternating automata [Udi Boker and Karoliina Lehtinen, 2019], pushdown automata [Enzo Erlich et al., 2022; Enzo Erlich et al., 2022], timed automata [Thomas A. Henzinger et al., 2022; Sougata Bose et al., 2022], Parikh automata [Enzo Erlich et al., 2022], and quantiative automata [Udi Boker and Karoliina Lehtinen, 2021], to name a few. In each of these models, history-determinism offers some trade-offs between the power of nondeterminism and the algorithmic properties of determinism. In particular, depending on the model, they can be either more expressive or more succinct than their deterministic counterparts, while retaining better algorithmic properties - in particular with respect to deciding universality, language inclusion and games - than fully nondeterministic automata. The drive to extend history-determinism to more powerful automata models has also lead to a better understanding of the properties of these automata, of how they compare to related notions (such as good-for-games automata and determinisability by pruning), and of the various games and tools used to study them. This talk aims to give a broad introduction to the notion of history determinism as well as an overview of some of the recent developements on the topic. It will also highlight some of the many problems that remain open. It is loosely based on a recent survey, written jointly with Udi Boker, which gives an informal presentation of what are, in our view, the key aspects of history-determinism [Udi Boker and Karoliina Lehtinen, 2023].

 Amortised Analysis of Dynamic Data Structures (Invited Talk)   
 Authors:  Eva Rotenberg  
  Abstract    
 In dynamic data structures, one is interested in efficiently facilitating queries to a data set, while being able to efficiently perform updates as the data set undergoes changes. Often, relaxing the efficiency measure to the amortised setting allows for simpler algorithms. A well-known example of a data structure with amortised guarantees is the splay tree by Sleator and Tarjan [Daniel D. Sleator and Robert E. Tarjan, 1985]. Similarly, in data structures for dynamic graphs, one is interested in efficiently maintaining some information about the graph, or facilitating queries, as the graph undergoes changes in the form of insertion and deletion of edges. Examples of such information include connectivity, planarity, and approximate sparsity of the graph: is the graph presently connected? Is it planar? Has its arboricity grossly exceeded some specified number α̃? The related queries could be: is a connected to b? Are the edges uv and uw consecutive in the ordering around u in its current planar embedding? Or, report the O(α) out-edges of vertex x. In this talk, we will see Brodal and Fagerberg’s amortised algorithm for orienting sparse graphs (i.e. of arboricity ≤ α), so that each vertex has O(α) out-edges [Gerth Stølting Brodal and Rolf Fagerberg, 1999]. The algorithm itself is extremely simple, and uses an elegant amortised argument in its analysis. Then, we will visit the problem of dynamic planarity testing: is the graph presently planar? Here, we will see an elegant amortised reduction to the seemingly easier problem, where planarity-violating edges may be detected and rejected [Eppstein et al., 1996]. We will see a sketch of how the current state-of-the-art algorithm for efficient planarity testing [Jacob Holm and Eva Rotenberg, 2020] uses ideas similar to those in [Gerth Stølting Brodal and Rolf Fagerberg, 1999] to analyse the behaviour of a greedy algorithm via a possibly inefficient algorithm with provably low recourse [Jacob Holm and Eva Rotenberg, 2020]. If time permits, we will touch upon a recent simple amortised data structure for maintaining information in dynamic forests [Jacob Holm et al., 2023], which builds on ideas from splay trees. The talk concludes with some open questions in the area.

 Logical Algorithmics: From Theory to Practice (Invited Talk)   
 Authors:  Moshe Y. Vardi  
  Abstract    
 The standard approach to algorithm development is to focus on a specific problem and develop for it a specific algorithm. Codd’s introduction of the relational model in 1970 included two fundamental ideas: (1) Relations provide a universal data representation formalism, and (2) Relational databases can be queried using first-order logic. Realizing these ideas required the development of a meta-algorithm, which takes a declarative query and executes it with respect to a database. In this talk, I will describe this approach, which I call Logical Algorithmics, in detail, and explore its profound ramification.

 The Complexity of Checking Quasi-Identities over Finite Algebras with a Mal'cev Term   
 Authors:  Erhard Aichinger and Simon Grünbacher  
  Abstract    
 We consider finite algebraic structures and ask whether every solution of a given system of equations satisfies some other equation. This can be formulated as checking the validity of certain first order formulae called quasi-identities. Checking the validity of quasi-identities is closely linked to solving systems of equations. For systems of equations over finite algebras with finitely many fundamental operations, a complete P/NPC dichotomy is known, while the situation appears to be more complicated for single equations. The complexity of checking the validity of a quasi-identity lies between the complexity of term equivalence (checking whether two terms induce the same function) and the complexity of solving systems of polynomial equations. We prove that for each finite algebra with a Mal'cev term and finitely many fundamental operations, checking the validity of quasi-identities is coNP-complete if the algebra is not abelian, and in P when the algebra is abelian.

 Packing Odd Walks and Trails in Multiterminal Networks   
 Authors:  Maxim Akhmedov and Maxim Babenko  
  Abstract    
 Let G be an undirected network with a distinguished set of terminals T ⊆ V(G) and edge capacities cap: E(G) → ℝ_+. By an odd T-walk we mean a walk in G (with possible vertex and edge self-intersections) connecting two distinct terminals and consisting of an odd number of edges. Inspired by the work of Schrijver and Seymour on odd path packing for two terminals, we consider packings of odd T-walks subject to capacities cap. First, we present a strongly polynomial time algorithm for constructing a maximum fractional packing of odd T-walks. For even integer capacities, our algorithm constructs a packing that is half-integer. Additionally, if cap(δ(v)) is divisible by 4 for any v ∈ V(G)-T, our algorithm constructs an integer packing. Second, we establish and prove the corresponding min-max relation. Third, if G is inner Eulerian (i.e. degrees of all nodes in V(G)-T are even) and cap(e) = 2 for all e ∈ E, we show that there exists an integer packing of odd T-trails (i.e. odd T-walks with no repeated edges) of the same value as in case of odd T-walks, and this packing can be found in polynomial time. To achieve the above goals, we establish a connection between packings of odd T-walks and T-trails and certain multiflow problems in undirected and bidirected graphs.

 Improved Weighted Matching in the Sliding Window Model   
 Authors:  Cezar-Mihail Alexandru, Pavel Dvořák, Christian Konrad, and Kheeran K. Naidu  
  Abstract    
 We consider the Maximum-weight Matching (MWM) problem in the streaming sliding window model of computation. In this model, the input consists of a sequence of weighted edges on a given vertex set V of size n. The objective is to maintain an approximation of a maximum-weight matching in the graph spanned by the L most recent edges, for some integer L, using as little space as possible. Prior to our work, the state-of-the-art results were a (3.5+ε)-approximation algorithm for MWM by Biabani et al. [ISAAC'21] and a (3+ε)-approximation for (unweighted) Maximum Matching (MM) by Crouch et al. [ESA'13]. Both algorithms use space Õ(n). We give the following results: 1) We give a (2+ε)-approximation algorithm for MWM with space Õ(√{nL}). Under the reasonable assumption that the graphs spanned by the edges in each sliding window are simple, our algorithm uses space Õ(n √n). 2) In the Õ(n) space regime, we give a (3+ε)-approximation algorithm for MWM, thereby closing the gap between the best-known approximation ratio for MWM and MM. Similar to Biabani et al.’s MWM algorithm, both our algorithms execute multiple instances of the (2+ε)-approximation Õ(n)-space streaming algorithm for MWM by Paz and Schwartzman [SODA'17] on different portions of the stream. Our improvements are obtained by selecting these substreams differently. Furthermore, our (2+ε)-approximation algorithm runs the Paz-Schwartzman algorithm in reverse direction over some parts of the stream, and in forward direction over other parts, which allows for an improved approximation guarantee at the cost of increased space requirements.

 Approximate Sampling and Counting of Graphs with Near-Regular Degree Intervals   
 Authors:  Georgios Amanatidis and Pieter Kleer  
  Abstract    
 The approximate uniform sampling of graphs with a given degree sequence is a well-known, extensively studied problem in theoretical computer science and has significant applications, e.g., in the analysis of social networks. In this work we study a generalization of the problem, where degree intervals are specified instead of a single degree sequence. We are interested in sampling and counting graphs whose degree sequences satisfy the corresponding degree interval constraints. A natural scenario where this problem arises is in hypothesis testing on networks that are only partially observed. We provide the first fully polynomial almost uniform sampler (FPAUS) as well as the first fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) for sampling and counting, respectively, graphs with near-regular degree intervals, i.e., graphs in which every node has a degree from an interval not too far away from a given r ∈ ℕ. In order to design our FPAUS, we rely on various state-of-the-art tools from Markov chain theory and combinatorics. In particular, by carefully using Markov chain decomposition and comparison arguments, we reduce part of our problem to the recent breakthrough of Anari, Liu, Oveis Gharan, and Vinzant (2019) on sampling a base of a matroid under a strongly log-concave probability distribution, and we provide the first non-trivial algorithmic application of a breakthrough asymptotic enumeration formula of Liebenau and Wormald (2017). As a more direct approach, we also study a natural Markov chain recently introduced by Rechner, Strowick and Müller-Hannemann (2018), based on three local operations - switches, hinge flips, and additions/deletions of an edge. We obtain the first theoretical results for this Markov chain, showing it is rapidly mixing for the case of near-regular degree intervals of size at most one.

 Enumerating Regular Languages with Bounded Delay   
 Authors:  Antoine Amarilli and Mikaël Monet  
  Abstract    
 We study the task, for a given language L, of enumerating the (generally infinite) sequence of its words, without repetitions, while bounding the delay between two consecutive words. To allow for delay bounds that do not depend on the current word length, we assume a model where we produce each word by editing the preceding word with a small edit script, rather than writing out the word from scratch. In particular, this witnesses that the language is orderable, i.e., we can write its words as an infinite sequence such that the Levenshtein edit distance between any two consecutive words is bounded by a value that depends only on the language. For instance, (a+b)^* is orderable (with a variant of the Gray code), but a^* + b^* is not. We characterize which regular languages are enumerable in this sense, and show that this can be decided in PTIME in an input deterministic finite automaton (DFA) for the language. In fact, we show that, given a DFA A, we can compute in PTIME automata A₁, …, A_t such that L(A) is partitioned as L(A₁) ⊔ … ⊔ L(A_t) and every L(A_i) is orderable in this sense. Further, we show that the value of t obtained is optimal, i.e., we cannot partition L(A) into less than t orderable languages. In the case where L(A) is orderable (i.e., t = 1), we show that the ordering can be produced by a bounded-delay algorithm: specifically, the algorithm runs in a suitable pointer machine model, and produces a sequence of bounded-length edit scripts to visit the words of L(A) without repetitions, with bounded delay - exponential in |A| - between each script. In fact, we show that we can achieve this while only allowing the edit operations push and pop at the beginning and end of the word, which implies that the word can in fact be maintained in a double-ended queue. By contrast, when fixing the distance bound d between consecutive words and the number of classes of the partition, it is NP-hard in the input DFA A to decide if L(A) is orderable in this sense, already for finite languages. Last, we study the model where push-pop edits are only allowed at the end of the word, corresponding to a case where the word is maintained on a stack. We show that these operations are strictly weaker and that the slender languages are precisely those that can be partitioned into finitely many languages that are orderable in this sense. For the slender languages, we can again characterize the minimal number of languages in the partition, and achieve bounded-delay enumeration.

 Regular Separability in Büchi VASS   
 Authors:  Pascal Baumann, Roland Meyer, and Georg Zetzsche  
  Abstract    
 We study the (ω-)regular separability problem for Büchi VASS languages: Given two Büchi VASS with languages L₁ and L₂, check whether there is a regular language that fully contains L₁ while remaining disjoint from L₂. We show that the problem is decidable in general and PSPACE-complete in the 1-dimensional case, assuming succinct counter updates. The results rely on several arguments. We characterize the set of all regular languages disjoint from L₂. Based on this, we derive a (sound and complete) notion of inseparability witnesses, non-regular subsets of L₁. Finally, we show how to symbolically represent inseparability witnesses and how to check their existence.

 Approximating Highly Inapproximable Problems on Graphs of Bounded Twin-Width   
 Authors:  Pierre Bergé, Édouard Bonnet, Hugues Déprés, and Rémi Watrigant  
  Abstract    
 For any ε > 0, we give a polynomial-time n^ε-approximation algorithm for Max Independent Set in graphs of bounded twin-width given with an O(1)-sequence. This result is derived from the following time-approximation trade-off: We establish an O(1)^{2^q-1}-approximation algorithm running in time exp(O_q(n^{2^{-q}})), for every integer q ⩾ 0. Guided by the same framework, we obtain similar approximation algorithms for Min Coloring and Max Induced Matching. In general graphs, all these problems are known to be highly inapproximable: for any ε > 0, a polynomial-time n^{1-ε}-approximation for any of them would imply that P=NP [Håstad, FOCS '96; Zuckerman, ToC '07; Chalermsook et al., SODA '13]. We generalize the algorithms for Max Independent Set and Max Induced Matching to the independent (induced) packing of any fixed connected graph H. In contrast, we show that such approximation guarantees on graphs of bounded twin-width given with an O(1)-sequence are very unlikely for Min Independent Dominating Set, and somewhat unlikely for Longest Path and Longest Induced Path. Regarding the existence of better approximation algorithms, there is a (very) light evidence that the obtained approximation factor of n^ε for Max Independent Set may be best possible. This is the first in-depth study of the approximability of problems in graphs of bounded twin-width. Prior to this paper, essentially the only such result was a polynomial-time O(1)-approximation algorithm for Min Dominating Set [Bonnet et al., ICALP '21].

 Tight Lower Bounds for Problems Parameterized by Rank-Width   
 Authors:  Benjamin Bergougnoux, Tuukka Korhonen, and Jesper Nederlof  
  Abstract    
 We show that there is no 2^o(k²) n^O(1) time algorithm for Independent Set on n-vertex graphs with rank-width k, unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails. Our lower bound matches the 2^O(k²) n^O(1) time algorithm given by Bui-Xuan, Telle, and Vatshelle [Discret. Appl. Math., 2010] and it answers the open question of Bergougnoux and Kanté [SIAM J. Discret. Math., 2021]. We also show that the known 2^O(k²) n^O(1) time algorithms for Weighted Dominating Set, Maximum Induced Matching and Feedback Vertex Set parameterized by rank-width k are optimal assuming ETH. Our results are the first tight ETH lower bounds parameterized by rank-width that do not follow directly from lower bounds for n-vertex graphs.

 On the Multilinear Complexity of Associative Algebras   
 Authors:  Markus Bläser, Hendrik Mayer, and Devansh Shringi  
  Abstract    
 Christandl and Zuiddam [Matthias Christandl and Jeroen Zuiddam, 2019] study the multilinear complexity of d-fold matrix multiplication in the context of quantum communication complexity. Bshouty [Nader H. Bshouty, 2013] investigates the multilinear complexity of d-fold multiplication in commutative algebras to understand the size of so-called testers. The study of bilinear complexity is a classical topic in algebraic complexity theory, starting with the work by Strassen. However, there has been no systematic study of the multilinear complexity of multilinear maps. In the present work, we systematically investigate the multilinear complexity of d-fold multiplication in arbitrary associative algebras. We prove a multilinear generalization of the famous Alder-Strassen theorem, which is a lower bound for the bilinear complexity of the (2-fold) multiplication in an associative algebra. We show that the multilinear complexity of the d-fold multiplication has a lower bound of d ⋅ dim A - (d-1)t, where t is the number of maximal twosided ideals in A. This is optimal in the sense that there are algebras for which this lower bound is tight. Furthermore, we prove the following dichotomy that the quotient algebra A/rad A determines the complexity of the d-fold multiplication in A: When the semisimple algebra A/rad A is commutative, then the multilinear complexity of the d-fold multiplication in A is polynomial in d. On the other hand, when A/rad A is noncommutative, then the multilinear complexity of the d-fold multiplication in A is exponential in d.

 Authors:  Thomas Bläsius, Tobias Friedrich, Maximilian Katzmann, and Daniel Stephan  
  Abstract    
 The class of Euclidean unit disk graphs is one of the most fundamental and well-studied graph classes with underlying geometry. In this paper, we identify this class as a special case in the broader class of hyperbolic unit disk graphs and introduce strongly hyperbolic unit disk graphs as a natural counterpart to the Euclidean variant. In contrast to the grid-like structures exhibited by Euclidean unit disk graphs, strongly hyperbolic networks feature hierarchical structures, which are also observed in complex real-world networks. We investigate basic properties of strongly hyperbolic unit disk graphs, including adjacencies and the formation of cliques, and utilize the derived insights to demonstrate that the class is useful for the development and analysis of graph algorithms. Specifically, we develop a simple greedy routing scheme and analyze its performance on strongly hyperbolic unit disk graphs in order to prove that routing can be performed more efficiently on such networks than in general.

 Tight Bounds for Connectivity Problems Parameterized by Cutwidth   
 Authors:  Narek Bojikian, Vera Chekan, Falko Hegerfeld, and Stefan Kratsch  
  Abstract    
 In this work we start the investigation of tight complexity bounds for connectivity problems parameterized by cutwidth assuming the Strong Exponential-Time Hypothesis (SETH). Van Geffen et al. [Bas A. M. van Geffen et al., 2020] posed this question for Odd Cycle Transversal and Feedback Vertex Set. We answer it for these two and four further problems, namely Connected Vertex Cover, Connected Dominating Set, Steiner Tree, and Connected Odd Cycle Transversal. For the latter two problems it sufficed to prove lower bounds that match the running time inherited from parameterization by treewidth; for the others we provide faster algorithms than relative to treewidth and prove matching lower bounds. For upper bounds we first extend the idea of Groenland et al. [Carla Groenland et al., 2022] to solve what we call coloring-like problems. Such problems are defined by a symmetric matrix M over 𝔽₂ indexed by a set of colors. The goal is to count the number (modulo some prime p) of colorings of a graph such that M has a 1-entry if indexed by the colors of the end-points of any edge. We show that this problem can be solved faster if M has small rank over 𝔽_p. We apply this result to get our upper bounds for CVC and CDS. The upper bounds for OCT and FVS use a subdivision trick to get below the bounds that matrix rank would yield.

 Twin-Width V: Linear Minors, Modular Counting, and Matrix Multiplication   
 Authors:  Édouard Bonnet, Ugo Giocanti, Patrice Ossona de Mendez, and Stéphan Thomassé  
  Abstract    
 We continue developing the theory around the twin-width of totally ordered binary structures (or equivalently, matrices over a finite alphabet), initiated in the previous paper of the series. We first introduce the notion of parity and linear minors of a matrix, which consists of iteratively replacing consecutive rows or consecutive columns with a linear combination of them. We show that a matrix class (i.e., a set of matrices closed under taking submatrices) has bounded twin-width if and only if its linear-minor closure does not contain all matrices. We observe that the fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm for first-order model checking on structures given with an O(1)-sequence (certificate of bounded twin-width) and the fact that first-order transductions of bounded twin-width classes have bounded twin-width, both established in Twin-width I, extend to first-order logic with modular counting quantifiers. We make explicit a win-win argument obtained as a by-product of Twin-width IV, and somewhat similar to bidimensionality, that we call rank-bidimensionality. This generalizes the seminal work of Guillemot and Marx [SODA '14], which builds on the Marcus-Tardos theorem [JCTA '04]. It works on general matrices (not only on classes of bounded twin-width) and, for example, yields FPT algorithms deciding if a small matrix is a parity or a linear minor of another matrix given in input, or exactly computing the grid or mixed number of a given matrix (i.e., the maximum integer k such that the row set and the column set of the matrix can be partitioned into k intervals, with each of the k² defined cells containing a non-zero entry, or two distinct rows and two distinct columns, respectively). Armed with the above-mentioned extension to modular counting, we show that the twin-width of the product of two conformal matrices A, B (i.e., whose dimensions are such that AB is defined) over a finite field is bounded by a function of the twin-width of A, of B, and of the size of the field. Furthermore, if A and B are n × n matrices of twin-width d over F_q, we show that AB can be computed in time O_{d,q}(n² log n). We finally present an ad hoc algorithm to efficiently multiply two matrices of bounded twin-width, with a single-exponential dependence in the twin-width bound. More precisely, pipelined to observations and results of Pilipczuk et al. [STACS '22], we obtain the following. If the inputs are given in a compact tree-like form (witnessing twin-width at most d), called twin-decomposition of width d, then two n × n matrices A, B over F₂ can be multiplied in time 4^{d+o(d)}n, in the sense that a twin-decomposition of their product AB, with width 2^{d+o(d)}, is output within that time, and each entry of AB can be queried in time O_d(log log n). Furthermore, for every ε > 0, the query time can be brought to constant time O(1/ε) if the running time is increased to near-linear 4^{d+o(d)}n^{1+ε}. Notably, the running time is sublinear (essentially square root) in the number of (non-zero) entries.

 Non-Adaptive Proper Learning Polynomials   
 Authors:  Nader H. Bshouty  
  Abstract    
 We give the first polynomial-time non-adaptive proper learning algorithm of Boolean sparse multivariate polynomial under the uniform distribution. Our algorithm, for s-sparse polynomial over n variables, makes q = (s/ε)^{γ(s,ε)}log n queries where 2.66 ≤ γ(s,ε) ≤ 6.922 and runs in Õ(n)⋅ poly(s,1/ε) time. We also show that for any ε = 1/s^{O(1)} any non-adaptive learning algorithm must make at least (s/ε)^{Ω(1)}log n queries. Therefore, the query complexity of our algorithm is also polynomial in the optimal query complexity and optimal in n.

 Cut Paths and Their Remainder Structure, with Applications   
 Authors:  Massimo Cairo, Shahbaz Khan, Romeo Rizzi, Sebastian Schmidt, Alexandru I. Tomescu, and Elia C. Zirondelli  
  Abstract    
 In a strongly connected graph G = (V,E), a cut arc (also called strong bridge) is an arc e ∈ E whose removal makes the graph no longer strongly connected. Equivalently, there exist u,v ∈ V, such that all u-v walks contain e. Cut arcs are a fundamental graph-theoretic notion, with countless applications, especially in reachability problems. In this paper we initiate the study of cut paths, as a generalisation of cut arcs, which we naturally define as those paths P for which there exist u,v ∈ V, such that all u-v walks contain P as subwalk. We first prove various properties of cut paths and define their remainder structures, which we use to present a simple O(m)-time verification algorithm for a cut path (|V| = n, |E| = m). Secondly, we apply cut paths and their remainder structures to improve several reachability problems from bioinformatics, as follows. A walk is called safe if it is a subwalk of every node-covering closed walk of a strongly connected graph. Multi-safety is defined analogously, by considering node-covering sets of closed walks instead. We show that cut paths provide simple O(m)-time algorithms verifying if a walk is safe or multi-safe. For multi-safety, we present the first linear time algorithm, while for safety, we present a simple algorithm where the state-of-the-art employed complex data structures. Finally we show that the simultaneous computation of remainder structures of all subwalks of a cut path can be performed in linear time, since they are related in a structured way. These properties yield an O(mn)-time algorithm outputting all maximal multi-safe walks, improving over the state-of-the-art algorithm running in time O(m²+n³). The results of this paper only scratch the surface in the study of cut paths, and we believe a rich structure of a graph can be revealed, considering the perspective of a path, instead of just an arc.

 Geometric Amortization of Enumeration Algorithms   
 Authors:  Florent Capelli and Yann Strozecki  
  Abstract    
 In this paper, we introduce a technique we call geometric amortization for enumeration algorithms, which can be used to make the delay of enumeration algorithms more regular with little overhead on the space it uses. More precisely, we consider enumeration algorithms having incremental linear delay, that is, algorithms enumerating, on input x, a set A(x) such that for every t ≤ ♯ A(x), it outputs at least t solutions in time O(t⋅p(|x|)), where p is a polynomial. We call p the incremental delay of the algorithm. While it is folklore that one can transform such an algorithm into an algorithm with maximal delay O(p(|x|)), the naive transformation may use exponential space. We show that, using geometric amortization, such an algorithm can be transformed into an algorithm with delay O(p(|x|)log(♯A(x))) and space O(s log(♯A(x))) where s is the space used by the original algorithm. In terms of complexity, we prove that classes DelayP and IncP₁ with polynomial space coincide. We apply geometric amortization to show that one can trade the delay of flashlight search algorithms for their average delay up to a factor of O(log(♯A(x))). We illustrate how this tradeoff is advantageous for the enumeration of solutions of DNF formulas.

 One Drop of Non-Determinism in a Random Deterministic Automaton   
 Authors:  Arnaud Carayol, Philippe Duchon, Florent Koechlin, and Cyril Nicaud  
  Abstract    
 Every language recognized by a non-deterministic finite automaton can be recognized by a deterministic automaton, at the cost of a potential increase of the number of states, which in the worst case can go from n states to 2ⁿ states. In this article, we investigate this classical result in a probabilistic setting where we take a deterministic automaton with n states uniformly at random and add just one random transition. These automata are almost deterministic in the sense that only one state has a non-deterministic choice when reading an input letter. In our model each state has a fixed probability to be final. We prove that for any d ≥ 1, with non-negligible probability the minimal (deterministic) automaton of the language recognized by such an automaton has more than n^d states; as a byproduct, the expected size of its minimal automaton grows faster than any polynomial. Our result also holds when each state is final with some probability that depends on n, as long as it is not too close to 0 and 1, at distance at least Ω(1/√n) to be precise, therefore allowing models with a sublinear number of final states in expectation.

 Improved NP-Hardness of Approximation for Orthogonality Dimension and Minrank   
 Authors:  Dror Chawin and Ishay Haviv  
  Abstract    
 The orthogonality dimension of a graph G over ℝ is the smallest integer k for which one can assign a nonzero k-dimensional real vector to each vertex of G, such that every two adjacent vertices receive orthogonal vectors. We prove that for every sufficiently large integer k, it is NP-hard to decide whether the orthogonality dimension of a given graph over ℝ is at most k or at least 2^{(1-o(1))⋅k/2}. We further prove such hardness results for the orthogonality dimension over finite fields as well as for the closely related minrank parameter, which is motivated by the index coding problem in information theory. This in particular implies that it is NP-hard to approximate these graph quantities to within any constant factor. Previously, the hardness of approximation was known to hold either assuming certain variants of the Unique Games Conjecture or for approximation factors smaller than 3/2. The proofs involve the concept of line digraphs and bounds on their orthogonality dimension and on the minrank of their complement.

 Extending Merge Resolution to a Family of QBF-Proof Systems   
 Authors:  Sravanthi Chede and Anil Shukla  
  Abstract    
 Merge Resolution (MRes [Olaf Beyersdorff et al., 2021]) is a recently introduced proof system for false QBFs. Unlike other known QBF proof systems, it builds winning strategies for the universal player (countermodels) within the proofs as merge maps. Merge maps are deterministic branching programs in which isomorphism checking is efficient, as a result MRes is a polynomial time verifiable proof system. In this paper, we introduce a family of proof systems MRes-ℛ in which the information of countermodels are stored in any pre-fixed complete representation ℛ. Hence, corresponding to each possible complete representation ℛ, we have a sound and refutationally complete QBF-proof system in MRes-ℛ. To handle these arbitrary representations, we introduce consistency checking rules in MRes-ℛ instead of the isomorphism checking in MRes. As a result these proof systems are not polynomial time verifiable (Non-P). Consequently, the paper shows that using merge maps is too restrictive and with a slight change in rules, it can be replaced with arbitrary representations leading to several interesting proof systems. We relate these new systems with the implicit proof system from the algorithm in [Joshua Blinkhorn et al., 2021], which was designed to solve DQBFs (Dependency QBFs) using clause-strategy pairs like MRes. We use the OBDD (Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams) representation suggested in [Joshua Blinkhorn et al., 2021] and deduce that "Ordered" versions of the proof systems in MRes-ℛ are indeed polynomial time verifiable. On the lower bound side, we lift the lower bound result of regular MRes ([Olaf Beyersdorff et al., 2020]) by showing that the completion principle formulas (CR_n) from [Mikolás Janota and João Marques-Silva, 2015] which are shown to be hard for regular MRes in [Olaf Beyersdorff et al., 2020], are also hard for any regular proof system in MRes-ℛ. Thereby, the paper lifts the lower bound of regular MRes to an entire class of proof systems, which use various complete representations, including those undiscovered, instead of only merge maps. Thereby proving that the hardness of CR_n formulas is intact even after changing the weak isomorphism checking in MRes to the stronger consistency checking in MRes-ℛ.

 On Hardness of Testing Equivalence to Sparse Polynomials Under Shifts   
 Authors:  Suryajith Chillara, Coral Grichener, and Amir Shpilka  
  Abstract    
 We say that two given polynomials f, g ∈ R[x_1, ..., x_n], over a ring R, are equivalent under shifts if there exists a vector (a_1, ..., a_n) ∈ Rⁿ such that f(x_1+a_1, ..., x_n+a_n) = g(x_1, ..., x_n). This is a special variant of the polynomial projection problem in Algebraic Complexity Theory. Grigoriev and Karpinski (FOCS 1990), Lakshman and Saunders (SIAM J. Computing, 1995), and Grigoriev and Lakshman (ISSAC 1995) studied the problem of testing polynomial equivalence of a given polynomial to any t-sparse polynomial, over the rational numbers, and gave exponential time algorithms. In this paper, we provide hardness results for this problem. Formally, for a ring R, let SparseShift_R be the following decision problem - Given a polynomial P(X), is there a vector 𝐚 such that P(X+𝐚) contains fewer monomials than P(X). We show that SparseShift_R is at least as hard as checking if a given system of polynomial equations over R[x_1,..., x_n] has a solution (Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz). As a consequence of this reduction, we get the following results. 1) SparseShift_ℤ is undecidable. 2) For any ring R (which is not a field) such that HN_R is NP_R-complete over the Blum-Shub-Smale model of computation, SparseShift_ is also NP_R-complete. In particular, SparseShift_ℤ is also NP_ℤ-complete. We also study the gap version of the SparseShift_R and show the following. 1) For every function β:ℕ → ℝ_+ such that β ∈ o(1), N^β-gap-SparseShift_ℤ is also undecidable (where N is the input length). 2) For R = 𝔽_p, ℚ, ℝ or ℤ_q and for every β > 1 the β-gap-SparseShift_R problem is NP-hard. Furthermore, there exists a constant α > 1 such that for every d = O(1) in the sparse representation model, and for every d ≤ n^O(1) in the arithmetic circuit model, the α^d-gap-SparseShift_R problem is NP-hard when given polynomials of degree at most d, in O(nd) many variables, as input.

 Online Paging with Heterogeneous Cache Slots   
 Authors:  Marek Chrobak, Samuel Haney, Mehraneh Liaee, Debmalya Panigrahi, Rajmohan Rajaraman, Ravi Sundaram, and Neal E. Young  
  Abstract    
 It is natural to generalize the online k-Server problem by allowing each request to specify not only a point p, but also a subset S of servers that may serve it. To initiate a systematic study of this generalization, we focus on uniform and star metrics. For uniform metrics, the problem is equivalent to a generalization of Paging in which each request specifies not only a page p, but also a subset S of cache slots, and is satisfied by having a copy of p in some slot in S. We call this problem Slot-Heterogenous Paging. In realistic settings only certain subsets of cache slots or servers would appear in requests. Therefore we parameterize the problem by specifying a family 𝒮 ⊆ 2^[k] of requestable slot sets, and we establish bounds on the competitive ratio as a function of the cache size k and family 𝒮. If all request sets are allowed (𝒮 = 2^[k]), the optimal deterministic and randomized competitive ratios are exponentially worse than for standard Paging (𝒮 = {[k]}). As a function of |𝒮| and k, the optimal deterministic ratio is polynomial: at most O(k²|𝒮|) and at least Ω(√{|𝒮|}). For any laminar family {𝒮} of height h, the optimal ratios are O(hk) (deterministic) and O(h²log k) (randomized). The special case that we call All-or-One Paging extends standard Paging by allowing each request to specify a specific slot to put the requested page in. For All-or-One Paging the optimal competitive ratios are Θ(k) (deterministic) and Θ(log k) (randomized), while the offline problem is NP-hard. We extend the deterministic upper bound to the weighted variant of All-or-One Paging (a generalization of standard Weighted Paging), showing that it is also Θ(k). Some results for the laminar case are shown via a reduction to the generalization of Paging in which each request specifies a set P of pages, and is satisfied by fetching any page from P into the cache. The optimal ratios for the latter problem (with laminar family of height h) are at most hk (deterministic) and hH_k (randomized).

 On Rational Recursive Sequences   
 Authors:  Lorenzo Clemente, Maria Donten-Bury, Filip Mazowiecki, and Michał Pilipczuk  
  Abstract    
 We study the class of rational recursive sequences (ratrec) over the rational numbers. A ratrec sequence is defined via a system of sequences using mutually recursive equations of depth 1, where the next values are computed as rational functions of the previous values. An alternative class is that of simple ratrec sequences, where one uses a single recursive equation, however of depth k: the next value is defined as a rational function of k previous values. We conjecture that the classes ratrec and simple ratrec coincide. The main contribution of this paper is a proof of a variant of this conjecture where the initial conditions are treated symbolically, using a formal variable per sequence, while the sequences themselves consist of rational functions over those variables. While the initial conjecture does not follow from this variant, we hope that the introduced algebraic techniques may eventually be helpful in resolving the problem. The class ratrec strictly generalises a well-known class of polynomial recursive sequences (polyrec). These are defined like ratrec, but using polynomial functions instead of rational ones. One can observe that if our conjecture is true and effective, then we can improve the complexities of the zeroness and the equivalence problems for polyrec sequences. Currently, the only known upper bound is Ackermanian, which follows from results on polynomial automata. We complement this observation by proving a PSPACE lower bound for both problems for polyrec. Our lower bound construction also implies that the Skolem problem is PSPACE-hard for the polyrec class.

 Semigroup Intersection Problems in the Heisenberg Groups   
 Authors:  Ruiwen Dong  
  Abstract    
 We consider two algorithmic problems concerning sub-semigroups of Heisenberg groups and, more generally, two-step nilpotent groups. The first problem is Intersection Emptiness, which asks whether a finite number of given finitely generated semigroups have empty intersection. This problem was first studied by Markov in the 1940s. We show that Intersection Emptiness is PTIME decidable in the Heisenberg groups H_n(𝕂) over any algebraic number field 𝕂, as well as in direct products of Heisenberg groups. We also extend our decidability result to arbitrary finitely generated 2-step nilpotent groups. The second problem is Orbit Intersection, which asks whether the orbits of two matrices under multiplication by two semigroups intersect with each other. This problem was first studied by Babai et al. (1996), who showed its decidability within commutative matrix groups. We show that Orbit Intersection is decidable within the Heisenberg group H₃(ℚ).

 Solving Homogeneous Linear Equations over Polynomial Semirings   
 Authors:  Ruiwen Dong  
  Abstract    
 For a subset B of ℝ, denote by U(B) be the semiring of (univariate) polynomials in ℝ[X] that are strictly positive on B. Let ℕ[X] be the semiring of (univariate) polynomials with non-negative integer coefficients. We study solutions of homogeneous linear equations over the polynomial semirings U(B) and ℕ[X]. In particular, we prove local-global principles for solving single homogeneous linear equations over these semirings. We then show PTIME decidability of determining the existence of non-zero solutions over ℕ[X] of single homogeneous linear equations. Our study of these polynomial semirings is largely motivated by several semigroup algorithmic problems in the wreath product ℤ≀ℤ. As an application of our results, we show that the Identity Problem (whether a given semigroup contains the neutral element?) and the Group Problem (whether a given semigroup is a group?) for finitely generated sub-semigroups of the wreath product ℤ≀ℤ is decidable when elements of the semigroup generator have the form (y, ±1).

 An Approximation Algorithm for Distance-Constrained Vehicle Routing on Trees   
 Authors:  Marc Dufay, Claire Mathieu, and Hang Zhou  
  Abstract    
 In the Distance-constrained Vehicle Routing Problem (DVRP), we are given a graph with integer edge weights, a depot, a set of n terminals, and a distance constraint D. The goal is to find a minimum number of tours starting and ending at the depot such that those tours together cover all the terminals and the length of each tour is at most D. The DVRP on trees is of independent interest, because it is equivalent to the "virtual machine packing" problem on trees studied by Sindelar et al. [SPAA'11]. We design a simple and natural approximation algorithm for the tree DVRP, parameterized by ε > 0. We show that its approximation ratio is α + ε, where α ≈ 1.691, and in addition, that our analysis is essentially tight. The running time is polynomial in n and D. The approximation ratio improves on the ratio of 2 due to Nagarajan and Ravi [Networks'12]. The main novelty of this paper lies in the analysis of the algorithm. It relies on a reduction from the tree DVRP to the bounded space online bin packing problem via a new notion of "reduced length".

 Representation of Short Distances in Structurally Sparse Graphs   
 Authors:  Zdeněk Dvořák  
  Abstract    
 A partial orientation H of a graph G is a weak r-guidance system if for any two vertices at distance at most r in G, there exists a shortest path P between them such that H directs all but one edge in P towards this edge. In case that H has bounded maximum outdegree Δ, this gives an efficient representation of shortest paths of length at most r in G: For any pair of vertices, we can either determine the distance between them or decide the distance is more than r, and in the former case, find a shortest path between them, in time O(Δ^r). We show that graphs from many natural graph classes admit such weak guidance systems, and study the algorithmic aspects of this notion. We also apply the notion to obtain approximation algorithms for distance variants of the independence and domination number in graph classes that admit weak guidance systems of bounded maximum outdegree.

 Exact Matching: Algorithms and Related Problems   
 Authors:  Nicolas El Maalouly  
  Abstract    
 In 1982, Papadimitriou and Yannakakis introduced the Exact Matching (EM) problem where given an edge colored graph, with colors red and blue, and an integer k, the goal is to decide whether or not the graph contains a perfect matching with exactly k red edges. Although they conjectured it to be NP-complete, soon after it was shown to be solvable in randomized polynomial time in the seminal work of Mulmuley et al., placing it in the complexity class RP. Since then, all attempts at finding a deterministic algorithm for EM have failed, thus leaving it as one of the few natural combinatorial problems in RP but not known to be contained in P, and making it an interesting instance for testing the hypothesis RP = P. Progress has been lacking even on very restrictive classes of graphs despite the problem being quite well known as evidenced by the number of works citing it. In this paper we aim to gain more insight into EM by studying a new optimization problem we call Top-k Perfect Matching (TkPM) which we show to be polynomially equivalent to EM. By virtue of being an optimization problem, it is more natural to approximate TkPM so we provide approximation algorithms for it. Some of the approximation algorithms rely on a relaxation of EM on bipartite graphs where the output is required to be a perfect matching with a number of red edges differing from k by at most k/2, which is of independent interest and generalizes to the Exact Weight Perfect Matching (EWPM) problem. We also consider parameterized algorithms and show that TkPM can be solved in FPT time parameterized by k and the independence number of the graph. This result again relies on new tools developed for EM which are also of independent interest.

 Counting Temporal Paths   
 Authors:  Jessica Enright, Kitty Meeks, and Hendrik Molter  
  Abstract    
 The betweenness centrality of a vertex v is an important centrality measure that quantifies how many optimal paths between pairs of other vertices visit v. Computing betweenness centrality in a temporal graph, in which the edge set may change over discrete timesteps, requires us to count temporal paths that are optimal with respect to some criterion. For several natural notions of optimality, including foremost or fastest temporal paths, this counting problem reduces to #TEMPORAL PATH, the problem of counting all temporal paths between a fixed pair of vertices; like the problems of counting foremost and fastest temporal paths, #TEMPORAL PATH is #P-hard in general. Motivated by the many applications of this intractable problem, we initiate a systematic study of the parameterised and approximation complexity of #TEMPORAL PATH. We show that the problem presumably does not admit an FPT-algorithm for the feedback vertex number of the static underlying graph, and that it is hard to approximate in general. On the positive side, we prove several exact and approximate FPT-algorithms for special cases.

 Barriers for Faster Dimensionality Reduction   
 Authors:  Ora Nova Fandina, Mikael Møller Høgsgaard, and Kasper Green Larsen  
  Abstract    
 The Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform allows one to embed a dataset of n points in ℝ^d into ℝ^m, while preserving the pairwise distance between any pair of points up to a factor (1 ± ε), provided that m = Ω(ε^{-2} lg n). The transform has found an overwhelming number of algorithmic applications, allowing to speed up algorithms and reducing memory consumption at the price of a small loss in accuracy. A central line of research on such transforms, focus on developing fast embedding algorithms, with the classic example being the Fast JL transform by Ailon and Chazelle. All known such algorithms have an embedding time of Ω(d lg d), but no lower bounds rule out a clean O(d) embedding time. In this work, we establish the first non-trivial lower bounds (of magnitude Ω(m lg m)) for a large class of embedding algorithms, including in particular most known upper bounds.

 A Regular and Complete Notion of Delay for Streaming String Transducers   
 Authors:  Emmanuel Filiot, Ismaël Jecker, Christof Löding, and Sarah Winter  
  Abstract    
 The notion of delay between finite transducers is a core element of numerous fundamental results of transducer theory. The goal of this work is to provide a similar notion for more complex abstract machines: we introduce a new notion of delay tailored to measure the similarity between streaming string transducers (SST). We show that our notion is regular: we design a finite automaton that can check whether the delay between any two SSTs executions is smaller than some given bound. As a consequence, our notion enjoys good decidability properties: in particular, while equivalence between non-deterministic SSTs is undecidable, we show that equivalence up to fixed delay is decidable. Moreover, we show that our notion has good completeness properties: we prove that two SSTs are equivalent if and only if they are equivalent up to some (computable) bounded delay. Together with the regularity of our delay notion, it provides an alternative proof that SSTs equivalence is decidable. Finally, the definition of our delay notion is machine-independent, as it only depends on the origin semantics of SSTs. As a corollary, the completeness result also holds for equivalent machine models such as deterministic two-way transducers, or MSO transducers.

 New Clocks, Optimal Line Formation and Self-Replication Population Protocols   
 Authors:  Leszek Gąsieniec, Paul G. Spirakis, and Grzegorz Stachowiak  
  Abstract    
 In this paper we consider a known variant of the standard population protocol model in which agents are allowed to be connected by edges, referred to as the network constructor model. During an interaction between two agents the relevant connecting edge can be formed, maintained or eliminated by the transition function. Since pairs of agents are chosen uniformly at random the status of each edge is updated every Θ(n²) interactions in expectation which coincides with Θ(n) parallel time. This phenomenon provides a natural lower bound on the time complexity for any non-trivial network construction designed for this variant. This is in contrast with the standard population protocol model in which efficient protocols operate in O(polylog n) parallel time. The main focus of this paper is on efficient manipulation of linear structures including formation, self-replication and distribution (including pipelining) of complex information in the adopted model. - We propose and analyze a novel edge based phase clock counting parallel time Θ(nlog n) in the network constructor model, showing also that its leader based counterpart provides the same time guarantees in the standard population protocol model. Note that all currently known phase clocks can count parallel time not exceeding O(polylog n). - We prove that any spanning line formation protocol requires Ω(nlog n) parallel time if high probability guaranty is imposed. We also show that the new clock enables an optimal O(nlog n) parallel time spanning line construction, which improves dramatically on the best currently known O(n²) parallel time protocol, solving the main open problem in the considered model [O. Michail and P. Spirakis, 2016]. - We propose a new probabilistic bubble-sort algorithm in which random comparisons and transfers are limited to the adjacent positions in the sequence. Utilising a novel potential function reasoning we show that rather surprisingly this probabilistic sorting procedure requires O(n²) comparisons in expectation and whp, and is on par with its deterministic counterpart. - We propose the first population protocol allowing self-replication of a strand of an arbitrary length k (carrying k-bit message of size independent of the state space) in parallel time O(n(k+log n)). The bit pipelining mechanism and the time complexity analysis of self-replication process mimic those used in the probabilistic bubble-sort argument. The new protocol permits also simultaneous self-replication, where l copies of the strand can be created in parallel in time O(n(k+log n)log l). We also discuss application of the strand self-replication protocol to pattern matching. All protocols are always correct and provide time guarantees with high probability defined as 1-n^(-η), for a constant η > 0.

 Avoidance Games Are PSPACE-Complete   
 Authors:  Valentin Gledel and Nacim Oijid  
  Abstract    
 Avoidance games are games in which two players claim vertices of a hypergraph and try to avoid some structures. These games have been studied since the introduction of the game of SIM in 1968, but only few complexity results have been found out about them. In 2001, Slany proved some partial results on Avoider-Avoider games complexity, and in 2017 Bonnet et al. proved that short Avoider-Enforcer games are Co-W[1]-hard. More recently, in 2022, Miltzow and Stojaković proved that these games are NP-hard. As these games correspond to the misère version of the well-known Maker-Breaker games, introduced in 1963 and proven PSPACE-complete in 1978, one could expect these games to be PSPACE-complete too, but the question has remained open since then. Here, we prove here that both Avoider-Avoider and Avoider-Enforcer conventions are PSPACE-complete. Using the PSPACE-hardness of Avoider-Enforcer, we provide in appendix proofs that some particular Avoider-Enforcer games also are.

 Parameterized Lower Bounds for Problems in P via Fine-Grained Cross-Compositions   
 Authors:  Klaus Heeger, André Nichterlein, and Rolf Niedermeier  
  Abstract    
 We provide a general framework to exclude parameterized running times of the form O(l^β + n^γ) for problems that have polynomial running time lower bounds under hypotheses from fine-grained complexity. Our framework is based on cross-compositions from parameterized complexity. We (conditionally) exclude running times of the form O(l^{γ/(γ-1) - ε} + n^γ) for any 1 < γ < 2 and ε > 0 for the following problems: - Longest Common (Increasing) Subsequence: Given two length-n strings over an alphabet Σ (over ℕ) and l ∈ ℕ, is there a common (increasing) subsequence of length l in both strings? - Discrete Fréchet Distance: Given two lists of n points each and k ∈ N, is the Fréchet distance of the lists at most k? Here l is the maximum number of points which one list is ahead of the other list in an optimum traversal. - Planar Motion Planning: Given a set of n non-intersecting axis-parallel line segment obstacles in the plane and a line segment robot (called rod), can the rod be moved to a specified target without touching any obstacles? Here l is the maximum number of segments any segment has in its vicinity. Moreover, we exclude running times O(l^{2γ/(γ-1) - ε} + n^γ) for any 1 < γ < 3 and ε > 0 for: - Negative Triangle: Given an edge-weighted graph with n vertices, is there a triangle whose sum of edge-weights is negative? Here l is the order of a maximum connected component. - Triangle Collection: Given a vertex-colored graph with n vertices, is there for each triple of colors a triangle whose vertices have these three colors? Here l is the order of a maximum connected component. - 2nd Shortest Path: Given an n-vertex edge-weighted digraph, vertices s and t, and k ∈ ℕ, has the second longest s-t-path length at most k? Here l is the directed feedback vertex set number. Except for 2nd Shortest Path all these running time bounds are tight, that is, algorithms with running time O(l^{γ/(γ-1)} + n^γ) for any 1 < γ < 2 and O(l^{2γ/(γ -1)} + n^γ) for any 1 < γ < 3, respectively, are known. Our running time lower bounds also imply lower bounds on kernelization algorithms for these problems.

 Dynamic Maintenance of Monotone Dynamic Programs and Applications   
 Authors:  Monika Henzinger, Stefan Neumann, Harald Räcke, and Stefan Schmid  
  Abstract    
 Dynamic programming (DP) is one of the fundamental paradigms in algorithm design. However, many DP algorithms have to fill in large DP tables, represented by two-dimensional arrays, which causes at least quadratic running times and space usages. This has led to the development of improved algorithms for special cases when the DPs satisfy additional properties like, e.g., the Monge property or total monotonicity. In this paper, we consider a new condition which assumes (among some other technical assumptions) that the rows of the DP table are monotone. Under this assumption, we introduce a novel data structure for computing (1+ε)-approximate DP solutions in near-linear time and space in the static setting, and with polylogarithmic update times when the DP entries change dynamically. To the best of our knowledge, our new condition is incomparable to previous conditions and is the first which allows to derive dynamic algorithms based on existing DPs. Instead of using two-dimensional arrays to store the DP tables, we store the rows of the DP tables using monotone piecewise constant functions. This allows us to store length-n DP table rows with entries in [0,W] using only polylog(n,W) bits, and to perform operations, such as (min,+)-convolution or rounding, on these functions in polylogarithmic time. We further present several applications of our data structure. For bicriteria versions of k-balanced graph partitioning and simultaneous source location, we obtain the first dynamic algorithms with subpolynomial update times, as well as the first static algorithms using only near-linear time and space. Additionally, we obtain the currently fastest algorithm for fully dynamic knapsack.

 Approximate Selection with Unreliable Comparisons in Optimal Expected Time   
 Authors:  Shengyu Huang, Chih-Hung Liu, and Daniel Rutschmann  
  Abstract    
 Given n elements, an integer k ≤ n/2 and a parameter ε ≥ 1/n, we study the problem of selecting an element with rank in (k-nε, k+nε] using unreliable comparisons where the outcome of each comparison is incorrect independently with a constant error probability, and multiple comparisons between the same pair of elements are independent. In this fault model, the fundamental problems of finding the minimum, selecting the k-th smallest element and sorting have been shown to require Θ(n log 1/Q), Θ(n log k/Q) and Θ(n log n/Q) comparisons, respectively, to achieve success probability 1-Q [Uriel Feige et al., 1994]. Considering the increasing complexity of modern computing, it is of great interest to develop approximation algorithms that enable a trade-off between the solution quality and the number of comparisons. In particular, approximation algorithms would even be able to attain a sublinear number of comparisons. Very recently, Leucci and Liu [Stefano Leucci and Chih-Hung Liu, 2022] proved that the approximate minimum selection problem, which covers the case that k ≤ nε, requires expected Θ(ε^{-1} log 1/Q) comparisons, but the general case, i.e., for nε < k ≤ n/2, is still open. We develop a randomized algorithm that performs expected O(k/n ε^{-2} log 1/Q) comparisons to achieve success probability at least 1-Q. For k = n ε, the number of comparisons is O(ε^{-1} log 1/Q), matching Leucci and Liu’s result [Stefano Leucci and Chih-Hung Liu, 2022], whereas for k = n/2 (i.e., approximating the median), the number of comparisons is O(ε^{-2} log 1/Q). We also prove that even in the absence of comparison faults, any randomized algorithm with success probability at least 1-Q performs expected Ω(min{n, k/n ε^{-2} log 1/Q}) comparisons. As long as n is large enough, i.e., when n = Ω(k/n ε^{-2} log 1/Q), our lower bound demonstrates the optimality of our algorithm, which covers the possible range of attaining a sublinear number of comparisons. Surprisingly, for constant Q, our algorithm performs expected O(k/n ε^{-2}) comparisons, matching the best possible approximation algorithm in the absence of computation faults. In contrast, for the exact selection problem, the expected number of comparisons is Θ(n log k) with faults versus Θ(n) without faults. Our results also indicate a clear distinction between approximating the minimum and approximating the k-th smallest element, which holds even for the high probability guarantee, e.g., if k = n/2, Q = 1/n and ε = n^{-α} for α ∈ (0, 1/2), the asymptotic difference is almost quadratic, i.e., Θ̃(n^α) versus Θ̃(n^{2α}).

 Relating Description Complexity to Entropy   
 Authors:  Reijo Jaakkola, Antti Kuusisto, and Miikka Vilander  
  Abstract    
 We demonstrate some novel links between entropy and description complexity, a notion referring to the minimal formula length for specifying given properties. Let MLU be the logic obtained by extending propositional logic with the universal modality, and let GMLU be the corresponding extension with the ability to count. In the finite, MLU is expressively complete for specifying sets of variable assignments, while GMLU is expressively complete for multisets. We show that for MLU, the model classes with maximal Boltzmann entropy are the ones with maximal description complexity. Concerning GMLU, we show that expected Boltzmann entropy is asymptotically equivalent to expected description complexity multiplied by the number of proposition symbols considered. To contrast these results, we prove that this link breaks when we move to considering first-order logic FO over vocabularies with higher-arity relations. To establish the aforementioned result, we show that almost all finite models require relatively large FO-formulas to define them. Our results relate to links between Kolmogorov complexity and entropy, demonstrating a way to conceive such results in the logic-based scenario where relational structures are classified by formulas of different sizes.

 Induced Matching Below Guarantees: Average Paves the Way for Fixed-Parameter Tractability   
 Authors:  Tomohiro Koana  
  Abstract    
 In this work, we study the Induced Matching problem: Given an undirected graph G and an integer 𝓁, is there an induced matching M of size at least 𝓁? An edge subset M is an induced matching in G if M is a matching such that there is no edge between two distinct edges of M. Our work looks into the parameterized complexity of Induced Matching with respect to "below guarantee" parameterizations. We consider the parameterization u - 𝓁 for an upper bound u on the size of any induced matching. For instance, any induced matching is of size at most n/2 where n is the number of vertices, which gives us a parameter n/2 - 𝓁. In fact, there is a straightforward 9^{n/2 - 𝓁} ⋅ n^O(1)-time algorithm for Induced Matching [Moser and Thilikos, J. Discrete Algorithms]. Motivated by this, we ask: Is Induced Matching FPT for a parameter smaller than n/2 - 𝓁? In search for such parameters, we consider MM(G) - 𝓁 and IS(G) - 𝓁, where MM(G) is the maximum matching size and IS(G) is the maximum independent set size of G. We find that Induced Matching is presumably not FPT when parameterized by MM(G) - 𝓁 or IS(G) - 𝓁. In contrast to these intractability results, we find that taking the average of the two helps - our main result is a branching algorithm that solves Induced Matching in 49^{(MM(G) + IS(G))/ 2 - 𝓁} ⋅ n^O(1) time. Our algorithm makes use of the Gallai-Edmonds decomposition to find a structure to branch on.

 Finding and Counting Patterns in Sparse Graphs   
 Authors:  Balagopal Komarath, Anant Kumar, Suchismita Mishra, and Aditi Sethia  
  Abstract    
 We consider algorithms for finding and counting small, fixed graphs in sparse host graphs. In the non-sparse setting, the parameters treedepth and treewidth play a crucial role in fast, constant-space and polynomial-space algorithms respectively. We discover two new parameters that we call matched treedepth and matched treewidth. We show that finding and counting patterns with low matched treedepth and low matched treewidth can be done asymptotically faster than the existing algorithms when the host graphs are sparse for many patterns. As an application to finding and counting fixed-size patterns, we discover Õ(m³)-time, constant-space algorithms for cycles of length at most 11 and Õ(m²)-time, polynomial-space algorithms for paths of length at most 10.

 Maximum Matching via Maximal Matching Queries   
 Authors:  Christian Konrad, Kheeran K. Naidu, and Arun Steward  
  Abstract    
 We study approximation algorithms for Maximum Matching that are given access to the input graph solely via an edge-query maximal matching oracle. More specifically, in each round, an algorithm queries a set of potential edges and the oracle returns a maximal matching in the subgraph spanned by the query edges that are also contained in the input graph. This model is more general than the vertex-query model introduced by binti Khalil and Konrad [FSTTCS'20], where each query consists of a subset of vertices and the oracle returns a maximal matching in the subgraph of the input graph induced by the queried vertices. In this paper, we give tight bounds for deterministic edge-query algorithms for up to three rounds. In more detail: 1) As our main result, we give a deterministic 3-round edge-query algorithm with approximation factor 0.625 on bipartite graphs. This result establishes a separation between the edge-query and the vertex-query models since every deterministic 3-round vertex-query algorithm has an approximation factor of at most 0.6 [binti Khalil, Konrad, FSTTCS'20], even on bipartite graphs. Our algorithm can also be implemented in the semi-streaming model of computation in a straightforward manner and improves upon the state-of-the-art 3-pass 0.6111-approximation algorithm by Feldman and Szarf [APPROX'22] for bipartite graphs. 2) We show that the aforementioned algorithm is optimal in that every deterministic 3-round edge-query algorithm has an approximation factor of at most 0.625, even on bipartite graphs. 3) Last, we also give optimal bounds for one and two query rounds, where the best approximation factors achievable are 1/2 and 1/2 + Θ(1/n), respectively, where n is the number of vertices in the input graph.

 Distributed Quantum Interactive Proofs   
 Authors:  François Le Gall, Masayuki Miyamoto, and Harumichi Nishimura  
  Abstract    
 The study of distributed interactive proofs was initiated by Kol, Oshman, and Saxena [PODC 2018] as a generalization of distributed decision mechanisms (proof-labeling schemes, etc.), and has received a lot of attention in recent years. In distributed interactive proofs, the nodes of an n-node network G can exchange short messages (called certificates) with a powerful prover. The goal is to decide if the input (including G itself) belongs to some language, with as few turns of interaction and as few bits exchanged between nodes and the prover as possible. There are several results showing that the size of certificates can be reduced drastically with a constant number of interactions compared to non-interactive distributed proofs. In this paper, we introduce the quantum counterpart of distributed interactive proofs: certificates can now be quantum bits, and the nodes of the network can perform quantum computation. The first result of this paper shows that by using distributed quantum interactive proofs, the number of interactions can be significantly reduced. More precisely, our result shows that for any constant k, the class of languages that can be decided by a k-turn classical (i.e., non-quantum) distributed interactive protocol with f(n)-bit certificate size is contained in the class of languages that can be decided by a 5-turn distributed quantum interactive protocol with O(f(n))-bit certificate size. We also show that if we allow to use shared randomness, the number of turns can be reduced to three. Since no similar turn-reduction classical technique is currently known, our result gives evidence of the power of quantum computation in the setting of distributed interactive proofs as well. As a corollary of our results, we show that there exist 5-turn/3-turn distributed quantum interactive protocols with small certificate size for problems that have been considered in prior works on distributed interactive proofs such as [Kol, Oshman, and Saxena PODC 2018, Naor, Parter, and Yogev SODA 2020]. We then utilize the framework of the distributed quantum interactive proofs to test closeness of two quantum states each of which is distributed over the entire network.

 Reconfiguration of Digraph Homomorphisms   
 Authors:  Benjamin Lévêque, Moritz Mühlenthaler, and Thomas Suzan  
  Abstract    
 For a fixed graph H, the H-Recoloring problem asks whether, given two homomorphisms from a graph G to H, one homomorphism can be transformed into the other by changing the image of a single vertex in each step and maintaining a homomorphism to H throughout. The most general algorithmic result for H-Recoloring so far has been proposed by Wrochna in 2014, who introduced a topological approach to obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for any undirected loopless square-free graph H. We show that the topological approach can be used to recover essentially all previous algorithmic results for H-Recoloring and that it is applicable also in the more general setting of digraph homomorphisms. In particular, we show that H-Recoloring admits a polynomial-time algorithm i) if H is a loopless digraph that does not contain a 4-cycle of algebraic girth 0 and ii) if H is a reflexive digraph that contains no triangle of algebraic girth 1 and no 4-cycle of algebraic girth 0.

 An 𝒪(3.82^k) Time FPT Algorithm for Convex Flip Distance   
 Authors:  Haohong Li and Ge Xia  
  Abstract    
 Let P be a convex polygon in the plane, and let T be a triangulation of P. An edge e in T is called a diagonal if it is shared by two triangles in T. A flip of a diagonal e is the operation of removing e and adding the opposite diagonal of the resulting quadrilateral to obtain a new triangulation of P from T. The flip distance between two triangulations of P is the minimum number of flips needed to transform one triangulation into the other. The Convex Flip Distance problem asks if the flip distance between two given triangulations of P is at most k, for some given parameter k ∈ ℕ. We present an FPT algorithm for the Convex Flip Distance problem that runs in time 𝒪(3.82^k) and uses polynomial space, where k is the number of flips. This algorithm significantly improves the previous best FPT algorithms for the problem.

 Tight Bounds for Repeated Balls-Into-Bins   
 Authors:  Dimitrios Los and Thomas Sauerwald  
  Abstract    
 We study the repeated balls-into-bins process introduced by Becchetti, Clementi, Natale, Pasquale and Posta (2019). This process starts with m balls arbitrarily distributed across n bins. At each round t = 1,2,…, one ball is selected from each non-empty bin, and then placed it into a bin chosen independently and uniformly at random. We prove the following results: - For any n ⩽ m ⩽ poly(n), we prove a lower bound of Ω(m/n ⋅ log n) on the maximum load. For the special case m = n, this matches the upper bound of 𝒪(log n), as shown in [Luca Becchetti et al., 2019]. It also provides a positive answer to the conjecture in [Luca Becchetti et al., 2019] that for m = n the maximum load is ω(log n/ log log n) at least once in a polynomially large time interval. For m ∈ [ω(n), n log n], our new lower bound disproves the conjecture in [Luca Becchetti et al., 2019] that the maximum load remains 𝒪(log n). - For any n ⩽ m ⩽ poly(n), we prove an upper bound of 𝒪(m/n ⋅ log n) on the maximum load for all steps of a polynomially large time interval. This matches our lower bound up to multiplicative constants. - For any m ⩾ n, our analysis also implies an 𝒪(m²/n) waiting time to reach a configuration with a 𝒪(m/n ⋅ log m) maximum load, even for worst-case initial distributions. - For m ⩾ n, we show that every ball visits every bin in 𝒪(m log m) rounds. For m = n, this improves the previous upper bound of 𝒪(n log² n) in [Luca Becchetti et al., 2019]. We also prove that the upper bound is tight up to multiplicative constants for any n ⩽ m ⩽ poly(n).

 Maintaining CMSO₂ Properties on Dynamic Structures with Bounded Feedback Vertex Number   
 Authors:  Konrad Majewski, Michał Pilipczuk, and Marek Sokołowski  
  Abstract    
 Let 𝜑 be a sentence of CMSO₂ (monadic second-order logic with quantification over edge subsets and counting modular predicates) over the signature of graphs. We present a dynamic data structure that for a given graph G that is updated by edge insertions and edge deletions, maintains whether 𝜑 is satisfied in G. The data structure is required to correctly report the outcome only when the feedback vertex number of G does not exceed a fixed constant k, otherwise it reports that the feedback vertex number is too large. With this assumption, we guarantee amortized update time O_{𝜑,k}(log n). By combining this result with a classic theorem of Erdős and Pósa, we give a fully dynamic data structure that maintains whether a graph contains a packing of k vertex-disjoint cycles with amortized update time O_k(log n). Our data structure also works in a larger generality of relational structures over binary signatures.

 Sublinear-Time Probabilistic Cellular Automata   
 Authors:  Augusto Modanese  
  Abstract    
 We propose and investigate a probabilistic model of sublinear-time one-dimensional cellular automata. In particular, we modify the model of ACA (which are cellular automata that accept if and only if all cells simultaneously accept) so that every cell changes its state not only dependent on the states it sees in its neighborhood but also on an unbiased coin toss of its own. The resulting model is dubbed probabilistic ACA (PACA). We consider one- and two-sided error versions of the model (in the same spirit as the classes RP and BPP) and establish a separation between the classes of languages they can recognize all the way up to o(√n) time. As a consequence, we have a Ω(√n) lower bound for derandomizing constant-time one-sided error PACAs (using deterministic ACAs). We also prove that derandomization of T(n)-time PACAs (to polynomial-time deterministic cellular automata) for various regimes of T(n) = ω(log n) implies non-trivial derandomization results for the class RP (e.g., P = RP). The main contribution is an almost full characterization of the constant-time PACA classes: For one-sided error, the class equals that of the deterministic model; that is, constant-time one-sided error PACAs can be fully derandomized with only a constant multiplicative overhead in time complexity. As for two-sided error, we identify a natural class we call the linearly testable languages (LLT) and prove that the languages decidable by constant-time two-sided error PACAs are "sandwiched" in-between the closure of LLT under union and intersection and the class of locally threshold testable languages (LTT).

 Real Numbers Equally Compressible in Every Base   
 Authors:  Satyadev Nandakumar and Subin Pulari  
  Abstract    
 This work solves an open question in finite-state compressibility posed by Lutz and Mayordomo [Lutz and Mayordomo, 2021] about compressibility of real numbers in different bases. Finite-state compressibility, or equivalently, finite-state dimension, quantifies the asymptotic lower density of information in an infinite sequence. Absolutely normal numbers, being finite-state incompressible in every base of expansion, are precisely those numbers which have finite-state dimension equal to 1 in every base. At the other extreme, for example, every rational number has finite-state dimension equal to 0 in every base. Generalizing this, Lutz and Mayordomo in [Lutz and Mayordomo, 2021] (see also Lutz [Lutz, 2012]) posed the question: are there numbers which have absolute positive finite-state dimension strictly between 0 and 1 - equivalently, is there a real number ξ and a compressibility ratio s ∈ (0,1) such that for every base b, the compressibility ratio of the base-b expansion of ξ is precisely s? It is conceivable that there is no such number. Indeed, some works explore "zero-one" laws for other feasible dimensions [Fortnow et al., 2011] - i.e. sequences with certain properties either have feasible dimension 0 or 1, taking no value strictly in between. However, we answer the question of Lutz and Mayordomo affirmatively by proving a more general result. We show that given any sequence of rational numbers ⟨q_b⟩_{b=2}^∞, we can explicitly construct a single number ξ such that for any base b, the finite-state dimension/compression ratio of ξ in base-b is q_b. As a special case, this result implies the existence of absolutely dimensioned numbers for any given rational dimension between 0 and 1, as posed by Lutz and Mayordomo. In our construction, we combine ideas from Wolfgang Schmidt’s construction of absolutely normal numbers from [Schmidt, 1961], results regarding low discrepancy sequences and several new estimates related to exponential sums.

 Gap Preserving Reductions Between Reconfiguration Problems   
 Authors:  Naoto Ohsaka  
  Abstract    
 Combinatorial reconfiguration is a growing research field studying problems on the transformability between a pair of solutions for a search problem. For example, in SAT Reconfiguration, for a Boolean formula φ and two satisfying truth assignments σ_𝗌 and σ_𝗍 for φ, we are asked to determine whether there is a sequence of satisfying truth assignments for φ starting from σ_𝗌 and ending with σ_𝗍, each resulting from the previous one by flipping a single variable assignment. We consider the approximability of optimization variants of reconfiguration problems; e.g., Maxmin SAT Reconfiguration requires to maximize the minimum fraction of satisfied clauses of φ during transformation from σ_𝗌 to σ_𝗍. Solving such optimization variants approximately, we may be able to obtain a reasonable reconfiguration sequence comprising almost-satisfying truth assignments. In this study, we prove a series of gap-preserving reductions to give evidence that a host of reconfiguration problems are PSPACE-hard to approximate, under some plausible assumption. Our starting point is a new working hypothesis called the Reconfiguration Inapproximability Hypothesis (RIH), which asserts that a gap version of Maxmin CSP Reconfiguration is PSPACE-hard. This hypothesis may be thought of as a reconfiguration analogue of the PCP theorem. Our main result is PSPACE-hardness of approximating Maxmin 3-SAT Reconfiguration of bounded occurrence under RIH. The crux of its proof is a gap-preserving reduction from Maxmin Binary CSP Reconfiguration to itself of bounded degree. Because a simple application of the degree reduction technique using expander graphs due to Papadimitriou and Yannakakis (J. Comput. Syst. Sci., 1991) does not preserve the perfect completeness, we modify the alphabet as if each vertex could take a pair of values simultaneously. To accomplish the soundness requirement, we further apply an explicit family of near-Ramanujan graphs and the expander mixing lemma. As an application of the main result, we demonstrate that under RIH, optimization variants of popular reconfiguration problems are PSPACE-hard to approximate, including Nondeterministic Constraint Logic due to Hearn and Demaine (Theor. Comput. Sci., 2005), Independent Set Reconfiguration, Clique Reconfiguration, and Vertex Cover Reconfiguration.

 Dynamic Data Structures for Parameterized String Problems   
 Authors:  Jędrzej Olkowski, Michał Pilipczuk, Mateusz Rychlicki, Karol Węgrzycki, and Anna Zych-Pawlewicz  
  Abstract    
 We revisit classic string problems considered in the area of parameterized complexity, and study them through the lens of dynamic data structures. That is, instead of asking for a static algorithm that solves the given instance efficiently, our goal is to design a data structure that efficiently maintains a solution, or reports a lack thereof, upon updates in the instance. We first consider the CLOSEST STRING problem, for which we design randomized dynamic data structures with amortized update times d^𝒪(d) and |Σ|^𝒪(d), respectively, where Σ is the alphabet and d is the assumed bound on the maximum distance. These are obtained by combining known static approaches to CLOSEST STRING with color-coding. Next, we note that from a result of Frandsen et al. [J. ACM'97] one can easily infer a meta-theorem that provides dynamic data structures for parameterized string problems with worst-case update time of the form 𝒪_k(log log n), where k is the parameter in question and n is the length of the string. We showcase the utility of this meta-theorem by giving such data structures for problems DISJOINT FACTORS and EDIT DISTANCE. We also give explicit data structures for these problems, with worst-case update times 𝒪(k 2^k log log n) and 𝒪(k²log log n), respectively. Finally, we discuss how a lower bound methodology introduced by Amarilli et al. [ICALP'21] can be used to show that obtaining update time 𝒪(f(k)) for DISJOINT FACTORS and EDIT DISTANCE is unlikely already for a constant value of the parameter k.

 An Algebraic Approach to Vectorial Programs   
 Authors:  Charles Paperman, Sylvain Salvati, and Claire Soyez-Martin  
  Abstract    
 Vectorial programming, the combination of SIMD instructions with usual processor instructions, is known to speed-up many standard algorithms. Simple regular languages have benefited from this technology. This paper is a first step towards pushing these benefits further. We take advantage of the inner algebraic structure of regular languages and produce high level representations of efficient vectorial programs that recognize certain classes of regular languages. As a technical ingredient, we establish equivalences between classes of vectorial circuits and logical formalisms, namely unary temporal logic and first order logic. The main result is the construction of compilation procedures that turns syntactic semigroups into vectorial circuits. The circuits we obtain are small in that they improve known upper-bounds on representations of automata within the logical formalisms. The gain is mostly due to a careful sharing of sub-formulas based on algebraic tools.

 Reconstructing Words Using Queries on Subwords or Factors   
 Authors:  Gwenaël Richomme and Matthieu Rosenfeld  
  Abstract    
 We study word reconstruction problems. Improving a previous result by P. Fleischmann, M. Lejeune, F. Manea, D. Nowotka and M. Rigo, we prove that, for any unknown word w of length n over an alphabet of cardinality k, w can be reconstructed from the number of occurrences as subwords (or scattered factors) of O(k²√{nlog₂(n)}) words. Two previous upper bounds obtained by S. S. Skiena and G. Sundaram are also slightly improved: one when considering information on the existence of subwords instead of on the numbers of their occurrences, and, the other when considering information on the existence of factors.

 Dynamic Binary Search Trees: Improved Lower Bounds for the Greedy-Future Algorithm   
 Authors:  Yaniv Sadeh and Haim Kaplan  
  Abstract    
 Binary search trees (BSTs) are one of the most basic and widely used data structures. The best static tree for serving a sequence of queries (searches) can be computed by dynamic programming. In contrast, when the BSTs are allowed to be dynamic (i.e. change by rotations between searches), we still do not know how to compute the optimal algorithm (OPT) for a given sequence. One of the candidate algorithms whose serving cost is suspected to be optimal up-to a (multiplicative) constant factor is known by the name Greedy Future (GF). In an equivalent geometric way of representing queries on BSTs, GF is in fact equivalent to another algorithm called Geometric Greedy (GG). Most of the results on GF are obtained using the geometric model and the study of GG. Despite this intensive recent fruitful research, the best lower bound we have on the competitive ratio of GF is 4/3. Furthermore, it has been conjectured that the additive gap between the cost of GF and OPT is only linear in the number of queries. In this paper we prove a lower bound of 2 on the competitive ratio of GF, and we prove that the additive gap between the cost of GF and OPT can be Ω(m ⋅ log log n) where n is the number of items in the tree and m is the number of queries.

 The Complexity of Translationally Invariant Problems Beyond Ground State Energies   
 Authors:  James D. Watson, Johannes Bausch, and Sevag Gharibian  
  Abstract    
 The physically motivated quantum generalisation of k-SAT, the k-Local Hamiltonian (k-LH) problem, is well-known to be QMA-complete ("quantum NP"-complete). What is surprising, however, is that while the former is easy on 1D Boolean formulae, the latter remains hard on 1D local Hamiltonians, even if all constraints are identical [Gottesman, Irani, FOCS 2009]. Such "translation-invariant" systems are much closer in structure to what one might see in Nature. Moving beyond k-LH, what is often more physically interesting is the computation of properties of the ground space (i.e. "solution space") itself. In this work, we focus on two such recent problems: Simulating local measurements on the ground space (APX-SIM, analogous to computing properties of optimal solutions to MAX-SAT formulae) [Ambainis, CCC 2014], and deciding if the low energy space has an energy barrier (GSCON, analogous to classical reconfiguration problems) [Gharibian, Sikora, ICALP 2015]. These problems are known to be P^{QMA[log]}- and QCMA-complete, respectively, in the general case. Yet, to date, it is not known whether they remain hard in such simple 1D translationally invariant systems. In this work, we show that the 1D translationally invariant versions of both APX-SIM and GSCON are intractable, namely are P^{QMA_{EXP}}- and QCMA^{EXP}-complete ("quantum P^{NEXP}" and "quantum NEXP"), respectively. Each of these results is attained by giving a respective generic "lifting theorem". For APX-SIM we give a framework for lifting any abstract local circuit-to-Hamiltonian mapping H satisfying mild assumptions to hardness of APX-SIM on the family of Hamiltonians produced by H, while preserving the structural properties of H (e.g. translation invariance, geometry, locality, etc). Each result also leverages counterintuitive properties of our constructions: for APX-SIM, we compress the answers to polynomially many parallel queries to a QMA oracle into a single qubit. For GSCON, we show strong robustness, i.e. soundness even against adversaries acting on all but a single qudit in the system.

 Restless Temporal Path Parameterized Above Lower Bounds   
 Authors:  Philipp Zschoche  
  Abstract    
 Reachability questions are one of the most fundamental algorithmic primitives in temporal graphs - graphs whose edge set changes over discrete time steps. A core problem here is the NP-hard Short Restless Temporal Path: given a temporal graph G, two distinct vertices s and z, and two numbers δ and k, is there a δ-restless temporal s-z path of length at most k? A temporal path is a path whose edges appear in chronological order and a temporal path is δ-restless if two consecutive path edges appear at most δ time steps apart from each other. Among others, this problem has applications in neuroscience and epidemiology. While Short Restless Temporal Path is known to be computationally hard, e.g., it is NP-hard even if the temporal graph consists of three discrete time steps and it is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the feedback vertex number of the underlying graph, it is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the path length k. We improve on this by showing that Short Restless Temporal Path can be solved in (randomized) 4^(k-d)|G|^O(1) time, where d is the minimum length of a temporal s-z path.

 Optical Communications  
 Optical communication technologies will continue to be increasingly important in supporting the future Internet's expected scaling requirements of billions of users, their IT needs and aggregated huge bandwidths. Over the last two decades, optical communication technologies have increased the transmission capacity per fiber by several orders of magnitude, achieving Tbit/s transmissions. If the data traffic usage continues to increase at the current rate, a further increase in the transmission capacity of several orders of magnitude will be needed over the coming decades. This implies that future optical systems and networks should be able to support capacities well over Peta bit/s. However, the current technologies have already begun to reveal several fundamental limits; the electronic speed limit, the Shannon and quantum limit, and the IP  bottleneck. The future technologies must overcome these limits ensuring sustainable growth of network traffic. The optical communications theme aims to provide a forum for the presentation and discussion of significant progress of research, development and applications of cutting-edge technologies in optical communication devices, subsystems, systems and networks.

 Submission  
 Submissions for the main symposium or a special track must be in PDF file format (20MB max size). Authors will be able to update/change their paper submission(s) before the deadline. All information submitted must be error free, as it will be used for reviewing purposes and to generate the final symposium program and proceedings. During submission, you will be asked to select some research topics (including special tracks) that best fit your paper(s). Please, carefully choose these topics as they will be used by the system to find qualified reviewers for your paper(s).  
 Each paper will be reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee (PC) using a “double-blind” review process to determine its appropriateness for acceptance and presentation (oral or poster) at ISVC. Therefore, paper submissions should not contain names or other information revealing authors’ identity  .  
 A complete paper should be submitted in camera-ready format for review purposes. The length should match that intended for final publication. Papers accepted for the symposium will be allocated 12 pages in the proceedings (including references), with the option of purchasing up to 2 extra pages for $100 per page. If you are unwilling or unable to pay the extra charge you should limit yourself to 12 pages. Otherwise the page limit is 14 pages. All paper submissions will be handled electronically through our online web submission system.  
 Review  
 This is a fully refereed symposium. Papers submitted to ISVC must not have been previously published and must not be currently under consideration for publication in another conference. Submissions will be reviewed with an emphasis on potential to contribute to the state of the art in the field. Selection criteria include accuracy and originality of ideas, clarity and significance of results, and presentation quality. The form of presentation (oral or poster) will be decided based on the reviews of each submission and recommendation of the program chairs and the steering committee.  
 ChatGPT policy:  ChatGPT can be used for proofreading assistance but NOT  for manuscript writing, manufacturing of data, results, and arguments. Strong suspicion of violation of the above policy will result in automatically rejecting the submission.  
 Attendance  
 ISVC is a premier forum for presenting and discussing current research in visual computing. At least one author must attend and present the paper at the symposium. If no author can attend the symposium and present their paper(s) due to unforeseen reasons, they should contact the steering committee chair to make alternative arrangements (i.e., video presentation or presentation by another attendee).  Papers not presented at the symposium without a valid reason will be withdrawn from the symposium proceedings.   
 Publication  
 All papers, regardless to the form of presentation (i.e., oral or poster), will appear in the symposium proceedings, which will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). In submitting a paper the author(s) agree that, upon acceptance, they will prepare the final manuscript in time for inclusion into the symposium proceedings, attend the symposium in person, and present the paper.  
 Formatting  
 To format your paper, follow the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) guidelines and technical instructions  closely. Springer will eventually re-format all papers to produce the camera-ready pdf versions using the same formatting instructions. Therefore, if an author has squashed his or her paper by removing vertical spaces or changing font sizes, etc., the final pdf will cover more pages and additional page charges will apply.  
 Color Pages  
 There is no charge for color pages in the on-line  paper proceedings. Color figures in the printed  paper proceedings cost between 250 Euros per page on average and must be explicitly requested during registration (i.e., email admin@isvc.net).  
 Camera-Ready Manuscripts  
 Papers will be published both in printed proceedings and online. Since papers would need to be reformatted, besides submitting the pdf version of your paper, you would also need to submit ALL  files needed for generating the pdf file, for example:  
 (1) the tex-file(s) including any special style files you may have used,  
  (2) all images and illustrations in PostScript and/or PDF, and the final document in  
  (3) DVI (or Word doc and rtf file),  
  (4) PostScript and  
  (5) PDF formats.  
 Create a single gzipped tar-file or a ZIP archive file containing all files. Specific instructions where to upload your gzipped file will be provided at a later time.  
 As noted earlier, Springer will re-produce the final pdf version of all papers. They will contact you by email at a later time (i.e., after 3-4 weeks) for final approval of your paper(s). The e-mail will come from India and will have attachments (i.e., make sure that your spam filter does not reject it!!).  
 Copyright form  
 The copyright form can be downloaded from the LNCS web site  . It must be signed by at least one author to publish the paper in Springer Lecture Notes on Computer Science. Papers without signed copyright form will not be included in the proceedings. Please sign the form and submit it along with your final paper materials. In the “Editors” field, please put “Bebis et al.”

 In 2007, a minor name change occurred but did not alter the name "ATNAC". The first "A" in ATNAC was originally "Australian" but was changed to "Australasian" and the first ATNAC held outside Australia was held in Christchurch New Zealand in 2007. The idea being to host one in every three conferences in New Zealand for the foreseeable future.  
 ATNAC 2006, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 4-6 December, 2006   
 ATNAC 2005, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 21-24 November 2005   
 ATNAC 2004, Sydney, Australia, December 8-10, 2004   
 In 2003 ATNAC was held in conjunction with the re-formation of the Australian Telecommunications CRC. The Australian Telecommunications CRC CEO, Leith Campbell, suggested that ATNAC be revived as a flagship of Telecommunications research in Australia. This new revitalised series began in 2003 and has continued uninterrupted ever since.  
 In 1996, ATNAC conferences was delivered as a joint conference with the International Switching Symposium in Sydney.  
 In 1994, ATNAC was born as an amalgamation of local conferences and symposium. The first one was held in Melbourne in 1994 with General Chair Paul Kirton from Telecom Research Labs.  
 In 1993 the last of the "Australian Teletraffic Research Seminars" was conducted at RMIT University, Melbourne Australia and at that point, Telstra management felt that there were three seminars in Australia that attracted similar people and that they would only support a combined conference which brought together the three seminars titled "Australian Teletraffic Engineering Research Seminar", "Australian Multi-media Communications, Applications & Technology Workshop" and "Australian Broadband Switching & Services Symposium". Each of these had their own separate seminar series that had been supported by Telstra and were run in Australia.  
 For approximately eight years starting in the mid-1980s, a seminar series called the "Australian Teletraffic Research Seminar" was run on an annual basis.

 The International Teletraffic Congress (ITC) in 2025 will take place at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Campus Trondheim, Norway. The 36th event of this series features the topic Sustainable Digital Infrastructures. It is sponsored by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. During the event we will celebrate the 70th anniversary of the conference series, which took place in Copenhagen in 1955 for the first time. The evolution of communications, networking and digital infrastructures is driving the digitalization of our society. The immense energy consumption of digital infrastructures and broader implications on the environment trigger the need to embed the sustainability paradigm into the technological development. Sustainable evolution of these technologies is triggered by the influence of computer science and telecommunication, the massive deployment of mobile communications and optics, the success of collaborative networking and social networks, the ever-increasing speed and flexibility of new communication technologies, networks, user devices, and applications, and the ever-changing operational challenges arising from these developments. ITC 36 solicits original contributions that address the latest changes and developments in design, modelling, measurement, and performance evaluation of communication systems, networks, and services. The objectives in these areas include, among others, energy-efficiency and sustainable IT, network security and privacy, QoS and QoE, and resilience. ITC 36 covers topics in the areas of: Performance Evaluation, Control and Optimization Computer and communication networks, protocols and algorithms Wireless, mobile, ad-hoc and sensor networks, IoT applications Virtualization, data centers, distributed and cloud computing Mobile and personal computing systems Energy-efficient computing systems Real-time and fault-tolerant systems Social networks, multimedia systems, service-oriented architectures and Web services Smart power grids and other cyber-physical systems Emerging technologies Analytical modeling techniques and model validation Workload characterization and benchmarking Performance, scalability, power and reliability analysis Sustainability analysis and power management System measurement, performance monitoring and forecasting Anomaly detection, problem diagnosis and trouble-shooting Capacity planning, resource allocation, run time management and scheduling Quality of service, total cost of ownership and pricing Network Measurements, Big Data and AI Big data analytics and machine learning for network & traffic measurements analysis Application of Big Data frameworks (streaming, batch) to network data Novel or better algorithms for topology discovery, network tomography, etc. Measurement-driven network simulation methodologies Performance models from network measurements Network performance measurements and analysis Traffic & workload modeling, traffic generation techniques User characterization and modeling Quality-of-Service and Quality-of-Experience Application layer measurement methodologies and characterization Traffic classification, evasion and deanonymization Network anomaly detection and diagnosis Measurements for network security and forensics Measurements for privacy quantification, and privacy-preserving measurements Deep learning and foundation models Networking Architectures and Paradigms Software Defined Networking Network Function Virtualization Information and Content-centric networks Named data networking Energy efficiency Network security Programmable data planes Applications of SDN and NFV Network virtualization Wireless and Cellular Networks 5G communications and architectures and beyond Internet of Things Age of information Dynamic spectrum access/cognitive radio Game-theoretic/economic models Green (energy-efficient) wireless communications IEEE802.11x Mesh networks Mobile ad-hoc networks Mobile computing services Radio resource allocation/management Spectrum auctions/management Self-organizing networks Small and ultra-dense cells Scheduling mechanisms Software defined wireless networks Traffic model, characterization and measurements Vehicular communications Wireless multiaccess and communication Wireless sensors  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2024-11-28

  Nobel Prize to John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton  
 At IWANN we join in the congratulation to John J. Hopfield and Geoffrey E. Hinton for the Nobel Prize in Physics  awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. We are ecstatic by the recognition of the field of Machine Learning and Neural Networks implied by the prize. Already at the first IWANN  edition in 1991, two papers ( this  and this  ) had the word “Hopfield” in their title, bearing witness to the high interest that John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton’s work has always raised in IWANN audience.  
 Tutorial: AI and Digital Twins in Healthcare  
 We are glad to announce that the tutorial AI and Digital Twins in Healthcare  will take place during IWANN 2025, delivered by Julià Camps. The tutorial can be attended by all IWANN 2025 participants, with no need for an additional registration.  
 First Call for Papers  
 On behalf of the Organizing Committee of the International Work-Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (IWANN 2025), we are pleased to invite you to participate in this event that will be held in June 2025 in A Coruña (Spain). This will be the 18th edition of IWANN, following on from an uninterrupted sequence of a staggering 34 years.  
 This biennial meeting seeks to provide a discussion forum for scientists, engineers, educators and students about the latest discoveries and realizations in the foundations, theory, models and applications of systems inspired by nature, as well as in emerging areas related to the above items, using computational intelligence methodologies. As in previous editions, we strongly emphasize the wide range of topics comprised under the umbrella of IWANN2025, from which we present a non-exhaustive list of areas of interest for the congress to get a flavour of IWANN25’s orientation:  
 Mathematical and theoretical methods in computational intelligence 
  Deep Learning 
  Learning and adaptation 
  Emulation of cognitive functions 
  Bio-inspired systems and neuro-engineering 
  Advanced topics in computational intelligence 
  Agent based models 
  Time series forecasting 
  Robotics and cognitive systems 
  Interactive systems and BCI 
  Machine Learning for 4.0 industry solutions 
  AI Health 
  AI in 5G technology 
  Social and Ethical aspects of AI 
  General Applications of AI 
  The approach will be both theoretical and practical, through invited talks, tutorials, workshops, posters, presentation of demos and functional prototypes. Besides, we offer the possibility to carry out a limited number of virtual presentations for those who want to participate but have serious difficulties to travel. The proceedings will include all the presented communications to the conference. As in previous editions of IWANN, we are arranging the publication of the proceedings with Springer-Verlag as Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series, and the books will be available shortly after the Congress in order to allow the authors to incorporate suggestions and improvements from the presentations. It is also foreseen the publication of extended versions of selected papers in special issues of several prestigious journals. Previous congresses led to special issues of Neural Computing and Applications, PLoS One and Neural Processing Letters. We are working to have at least the same collaborations.  
 We hope to see you in A Coruña next June. Do not miss on the deadline  !!

   Probing Taxonomic and Thematic Embeddings for Taxonomic Information    
  Filip Klubička  | John Kelleher    
 Modelling taxonomic and thematic relatedness is important for building AI with comprehensive natural language understanding. The goal of this paper is to learn more about how taxonomic information is structurally encoded in embeddings. To do this, we design a new hypernym-hyponym probing task and perform a comparative probing study of taxonomic and thematic SGNS and GloVe embeddings. Our experiments indicate that both types of embeddings encode some taxonomic information, but the amount, as well as the geometric properties of the encodings, are independently related to both the encoder architecture, as well as the embedding training data. Specifically, we find that only taxonomic embeddings carry taxonomic information in their norm, which is determined by the underlying distribution in the data.

   A W  ord N  et View on Crosslingual Transformers    
  Wondimagegnhue Tufa  | Lisa Beinborn  | Piek Vossen    
 WordNet is a database that represents relations between words and concepts as an abstraction of the contexts in which words are used. Contextualized language models represent words in contexts but leave the underlying concepts implicit. In this paper, we investigate how different layers of a pre-trained language model shape the abstract lexical relationship toward the actual contextual concept. Can we define the amount of contextualized concept forming needed given the abstracted representation of a word? Specifically, we consider samples of words with different polysemy profiles shared across three languages, assuming that words with a different polysemy profile require a different degree of concept shaping by context. We conduct probing experiments to investigate the impact of prior polysemy profiles on the representation in different layers. We analyze how contextualized models can approximate meaning through context and examine crosslingual interference effects.

   What to Make of make? Sense Distinctions for Light Verbs    
  Julie Kallini  | Christiane Fellbaum    
 Verbs like make, have and get present challenges for applications requiring automatic word sense discrimination. These verbs are both highly frequent and polysemous, with semantically “full” readings, as in make dinner, and “light” readings, as in make a request. Lexical resources like WordNet encode dozens of senses, making discrimination difficult and inviting proposals for reducing the number of entries or grouping them into coarser-grained supersenses. We propose a data-driven, linguistically-based approach to establishing a motivated sense inventory, focusing on make to establish a proof of concept. From several large, syntactically annotated corpora, we extract nouns that are complements of the verb make, and group them into clusters based on their Word2Vec semantic vectors. We manually inspect, for each cluster, the words with vectors closest to the centroid as well as a random sample of words within the cluster. The results show that the clusters reflect an intuitively plausible sense discrimination of make. As an evaluation, we test whether words within a given cluster cooccur in coordination phrases, such as apples and oranges, as prior work has shown that such conjoined nouns are semantically related. Conversely, noun complements from different clusters are less likely to be conjoined. Thus, coordination provides a similarity metric independent of the contextual embeddings used for clustering. Our results pave the way for a WordNet sense inventory that, while not inconsistent with the present one, would reduce it significantly and hold promise for improved automatic word sense discrimination.

   Towards Effective Correction Methods Using W  ord N  et Meronymy Relations    
  Javier Álvez  | Itziar Gonzalez-Dios  | German Rigau    
 In this paper, we analyse and compare several correction methods of knowledge resources with the purpose of improving the abilities of systems that require commonsense reasoning with the least possible human-effort. To this end, we cross-check the WordNet meronymy relation member against the knowledge encoded in a SUMO-based first-order logic ontology on the basis of the mapping between WordNet and SUMO. In particular, we focus on the knowledge in WordNet regarding the taxonomy of animals and plants. Despite being created manually, these knowledge resources — WordNet, SUMO and their mapping — are not free of errors and discrepancies. Thus, we propose three correction methods by semi-automatically improving the alignment between WordNet and SUMO, by performing some few corrections in SUMO and by combining the above two strategies. The evaluation of each method includes the required human-effort and the achieved improvement on unseen data from the WebChild project, that is tested using first-order logic automated theorem provers.

   On the Acquisition of W  ord N  et Relations in P  ortuguese from Pretrained Masked Language Models    
  Hugo Gonçalo Oliveira    
 This paper studies the application of pretrained BERT in the acquisition of synonyms, antonyms, hypernyms and hyponyms in Portuguese. Masked patterns indicating those relations were compiled with the help of a service for validating semantic relations, and then used for prompting three pretrained BERT models, one multilingual and two for Portuguese (base and large). Predictions for the masks were evaluated in two different test sets. Results achieved by the monolingual models are interesting enough for considering these models as a source for enriching wordnets, especially when predicting hypernyms of nouns. Previously reported performances on prediction were improved with new patterns and with the large model. When it comes to selecting the related word from a set of four options, performance is even better, but not enough for outperforming the selection of the most similar word, as computed with static word embeddings.

   W  ordnet for Definition Augmentation with Encoder-Decoder Architecture    
  Konrad Wojtasik  | Arkadiusz Janz  | Maciej Piasecki    
 Data augmentation is a difficult task in Natural Language Processing. Simple methods that can be relatively easily applied in other domains like insertion, deletion or substitution, mostly result in changing the sentence meaning significantly and obtaining an incorrect example. Wordnets are potentially a perfect source of rich and high quality data that when integrated with the powerful capacity of generative models can help to solve this complex task. In this work, we use plWordNet, which is a wordnet of the Polish language, to explore the capability of encoder-decoder architectures in data augmentation of sense glosses. We discuss the limitations of generative methods and perform qualitative review of generated data samples.

   Data Augmentation Method for Boosting Multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation    
  Arkadiusz Janz  | Marek Maziarz    
 Recent advances in Word Sense Disambiguation suggest neural language models can be successfully improved by incorporating knowledge base structure. Such class of models are called hybrid solutions. We propose a method of improving hybrid WSD models by harnessing data augmentation techniques and bilingual training. The data augmentation consist of structure augmentation using interlingual connections between wordnets and text data augmentation based on multilingual glosses and usage examples. We utilise language-agnostic neural model trained both with SemCor and Princeton WordNet gloss and example corpora, as well as with Polish WordNet glosses and usage examples. This augmentation technique proves to make well-known hybrid WSD architecture to be competitive, when compared to current State-of-the-Art models, even more complex.

   Mapping Wordnets on the Fly with Permanent Sense Keys    
  Eric Kafe    
 Most of the major databases on the semantic web have links to Princeton WordNet (PWN) synonym set (synset) identifiers, which differ for each PWN release, and are thus incompatible between versions. On the other hand, both PWN and the more recent Open English Wordnet (OEWN) provide permanent word sense identifiers (the sense keys), which can solve this interoperability problem. We present an algorithm that runs in linear time, to automatically derive a synset mapping between any pair of Wordnet versions that use PWN sense keys. This allows to update old WordNet links, and seamlessly interoperate with newer English Wordnet versions for which no prior mapping exists. By applying the proposed algorithm on the fly, at load time, we combine the Open Multilingual Wordnet (OMW 1.4, which uses old PWN 3.0 identifiers) with OEWN Edition 2021, and obtain almost perfect precision and recall. We compare the results of our approach using respectively synset offsets, versus the Collaborative InterLingual Index (CILI version 1.0) as synset identifiers, and find that the synset offsets perform better than CILI 1.0 in all cases, except a few ties.

   Linking the S  anskrit W  ord N  et to the V  edic Dependency Treebank: a pilot study    
  Erica Biagetti  | Chiara Zanchi  | Silvia Luraghi    
 The Sanskrit WordNet is a resource currently under development, whose core was induced from a Vedic text sample semantically annotated by means of an ontology mapped on the Princeton WordNet synsets. Building on a previous case study on Ancient Greek (Zanchi et al. 2021), we show how sentence frames can be extracted from morphosyntactically parsed corpora by linking an existing dependency treebank of Vedic Sanskrit to verbal synsets in the Sanskrit WordNet. Our case study focuses on two verbs of asking, yāc- and prach-, featuring a high degree of variability in sentence frames. Treebanks enhanced with WordNet-based semantic information revealed to be of crucial help in motivating sentence frame alternations.

  Oğuzhan Kuyrukçu  | Ezgi Sanıyar  | Olcay Taner Yildiz    
 In this paper, we introduce StarNet WordNet Editor, an open-source annotation tool designed for natural language processing. It’s mainly used for creating and maintaining machine-readable dictionaries like WordNet (Miller, 1995) or domain-specific dictionaries. WordNet editor provides a user friendly interface and since it is open-source, it is easy to use and develop. Besides English and Turkish WordNet (KeNet) (Bakay et al., 2020), it is also applicable to several languages and their domain specific dictionaries.

   Identifying F  rame N  et Lexical Semantic Structures for Knowledge Graph Extraction from Financial Customer Interactions    
  Cécile Robin  | Atharva Kulkarni  | Paul Buitelaar    
 We explore the use of the well established lexical resource and theory of the Berkeley FrameNet project to support the creation of a domain-specific knowledge graph in the financial domain, more precisely from financial customer interactions. We introduce a domain independent and unsupervised method that can be used across multiple applications, and test our experiments on the financial domain. We use an existing tool for term extraction and taxonomy generation in combination with information taken from FrameNet. By using principles from frame semantic theory, we show that we can connect domain-specific terms with their semantic concepts (semantic frames) and their properties (frame elements) to enrich knowledge about these terms, in order to improve the customer experience in customer-agent dialogue settings.

   Some Considerations in the Construction of a Historical Language W  ord N  et    
  Fahad Khan  | John P. McCrae  | Francisco Javier Minaya Gómez  | Rafael Cruz González  | Javier E. Díaz-Vera    
 This article describes the manual construction of a part of the Old English WordNet (Old-EWN) covering the semantic field of emotion terms. This manually constructed part of the wordnet is to be eventually integrated with the automatically generated/manually checked part covering the whole of the rest of the Old English lexicon (currently under construction). We present the workflow for the definition of these emotion synsets on the basis of a dataset produced by a specialist in this area. We also look at the enrichment of the original Global WordNet Association Lexical Markup Framework (GWA LMF) schema to include the extra information which this part of the OldEWN requires. In the final part of the article we discuss how the wordnet style of lexicon organisation can be used to share and disseminate research findings/datasets in lexical semantics.

   Hidden in Plain Sight: Can G  erman W  iktionary and Wordnets Facilitate the Detection of Antithesis?    
  Ramona Kuehn  | Jelena Mitrović  | Michael Granitzer    
 Existing wordnets mainly focus on synonyms, while antonyms have often been neglected, especially in wordnets in languages other than English. In this paper, we show how regular expressions are used to generate an antonym resource for German by using Wiktionary as a source. This resource contains antonyms for 45499 words. The antonyms can be used to extend existing wordnets. We show that this is important by comparing our antonym resource to the antonyms in OdeNet, the only freely available German wordnet that contains antonyms for 3059 words. We demonstrate that antonyms are relevant for the detection of the rhetorical figure antithesis. This figure has been known to influence the audience by creating contradiction and using a parallel sentence structure combined with antonyms. We first detect parallelism with part-of-speech tags and then apply our rule-based antithesis detection algorithm to a dataset of the messenger service Telegram. We evaluate our approach and achieve a precision of 57% and a recall of 45% thus overcoming the existing approaches.

   How do We Treat Systematic Polysemy in Wordnets and Similar Resources? – Using Human Intuition and Contextualized Embeddings as Guidance    
  Nathalie Sørensen  | Sanni Nimb  | Bolette Pedersen    
 Systematic polysemy is a well-known linguistic phenomenon where a group of lemmas follow the same polysemy pattern. However, when compiling a lexical resource like a wordnet, a problem arises regarding when to underspecify the two (or more) meanings by one (complex) sense and when to systematically split into separate senses. In this work, we present an extensive analysis of the systematic polysemy patterns in Danish, and in our preliminary study, we examine a subset of these with experiments on human intuition and contextual embeddings. The aim of this preparatory work is to enable future guidelines for each polysemy type. In the future, we hope to expand this approach and thereby hopefully obtain a sense inventory which is distributionally verified and thereby more suitable for NLP.

  Elena Irimia  | Verginica Mititelu    
 In this paper we present the standardization of the Romanian Wordnet by means of conversion to the Linked Open Data format. We describe the vocabularies used to encode data and metadata of this resource. The decisions made are in accordance with the characteristics of the Romanian Wordnet, which are the outcome of the development method, enrichment strategies and resources used for its creations. By interlinking with other resources, words in the Romanian Wordnet have now the pronunciation associated, as well as syntagmatic information, in the form of contexts of occurrences.

   Word Sense Disambiguation Based on Iterative Activation Spreading with Contextual Embeddings for Sense Matching    
  Arkadiusz Janz  | Maciej Piasecki    
 Many knowledge-based solutions were proposed to solve Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) problem with limited annotated resources. Such WSD algorithms are able to cover very large sense repositories, but still being outperformed by supervised ones on benchmark data. In this paper, we start with analysis identifying key properties and issues in application of spreading activation algorithms in knowledge-based WSD, e.g. influence of the network local structures, interaction with context information and sense frequency. Taking our observations as a point of departure, we introduce a novel solution with new context-to-sense matching using BERT embeddings, iterative parallel spreading activation function and selective sense alignment using contextual BERT embeddings. The proposed solution obtains performance beyond the state-of-the-art for the contemporary knowledge-based WSD approaches for both English and Polish data.

 In this project note we describe our work to make better documentation for the Open Multilingual Wordnet (OMW), a platform integrating many open wordnets. This includes the documentation of the OMW website itself as well as of semantic relations used by the component wordnets. Some of this documentation work was done with the support of the Google Season of Docs. The OMW project page, which links both to the actual OMW server and the documentation has been moved to a new location: https://omwn.org.

   Mapping G  erma N  et for the Semantic Web using O  nto L  ex-Lemon    
  Claus Zinn  | Marie Hinrichs  | Erhard Hinrichs    
 GermaNet is a large lexical-semantic net that relates German nouns, verbs, and adjectives semantically. The word net has been manually constructed over the last 25 years and hence presents a high-quality, valuable resource for German. While GermaNet is maintained in a Postgres database, all its content can be exported as an XML-based serialisation. Recently, this XML representation has been converted into RDF, largely by staying close to GermaNet’s principle of arrangement where lexunits that share the same meaning are grouped together into so-called synsets. With each lexical unit and synset now globally addressable via a unique resource identifier, it has become much easier to link together GermaNet entries with other lexical and semantic resources. In terms of semantic interoperability, however, the RDF variant of GermaNet leaves much to be desired. In this paper, we describe yet another conversion from GermaNet’s XML representation to RDF. The new conversion makes use of the OntoLex-Lemon ontology, and therefore, presents a decisive step toward a GermaNet representation with a much higher level of semantic interoperability, and which makes it possible to use GermaNet with other wordnets that already support this conceptualisation of lexica.

   Incorporating prepositions in the B  ul T  ree B  ank W  ord N  et    
  Zara Kancheva    
 A model for preposition incorporation in the BulTreeBank WordNet is presented which follows the model for presenting open class words in wordnets. An adapted semantic classification of prepositions is done on the base of Bulgarian grammars and the classes are used for synset categories. The good coverage of prepositions in the wordnet will be used for the aim of neural language models creation for Bulgarian. This extension of the wordnet improves its utility for semantic annotation.

 For Sign Languages (SLs), can we create a SignNet, like a WordNet for spoken languages: a network of semantic relations between constitutive elements of SLs? We first discuss approaches that link SL data to wordnets, or integrate such elements with some adaptations into the structure of WordNet. Then, we present requirements for a SignNet, which is built on SL data and then linked to WordNet.

 This paper describes the recently developed Latvian WordNet and the main linguistic principles used in its development. The inventory of words and senses is based on the Te̅zaurs.lv online dictionary, restructuring the senses of the most frequently used words based on corpus evidence. The semantic linking methodology adapts Princeton WordNet principles to fit the Latvian language usage and existing linguistic tradition. The semantic links include hyponymy, meronymy, antonymy, similarity, conceptual connection and gradation. We also measure inter-annotator agreement for different types of semantic links. The dataset consists of 7609 words linked in 6515 synsets. 1266 of these words are considered fully completed as they have all the outgoing semantic links annotated, corpus examples assigned for each sense, as well as links to the English Princeton WordNet formed. The data is available to the public on Te̅zaurs.lv as an addition to the general dictionary data, and is also published as a downloadable dataset.

  Luis Chiruzzo  | Marvin Agüero-Torales  | Aldo Alvarez  | Yliana Rodríguez    
 This paper presents a work in progress about creating a Guarani version of the WordNet database. Guarani is an indigenous South American language and is a low-resource language from the NLP perspective. Following the expand approach, we aim to find Guarani lemmas that correspond to the concepts defined in WordNet. We do this through three strategies that try to select the correct lemmas from Guarani-Spanish datasets. We ran them through three different bilingual dictionaries and had native speakers assess the results. This procedure found Guarani lemmas for about 6.5 thousand synsets, including 27% of the base WordNet concepts. However, more work on the quality of the selected words will be needed in order to create a final version of the dataset.

   A CCG  bank for T  urkish: From Dependency to CCG     
  Aslı Kuzgun  | Oğuz Kerem Yıldız  | Olcay Taner Yildiz    
 In this paper, we present the building of a CCGbank for Turkish by using standardised dependency corpora. We automatically induce Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) categories for each word token in the Turkish dependency corpora. The CCG induction algorithm we present here is based on the dependency relations that are defined in the latest release of the Universal Dependencies (UD) framework. We aim for an algorithm that can easily be used in all the Turkish treebanks that are annotated in this framework. Therefore, we employ a lexicalist approach in order to make full use of the dependency relations while creating a semantically transparent corpus. We present the treebanks we employed in this study as well as their annotation framework. We introduce the structure of the algorithm we used along with the specific issues that are different from previous studies. Lastly, we show how the results change with this lexical approach in CCGbank for Turkish compared to the previous CCGbank studies in Turkish.

 In this paper we report on a new Danish lexical initiative, the Central Word Register for Danish, (COR), which aims at providing an open-source, well curated and large-coverage lexicon for AI purposes. The semantic part of the lexicon (COR-S) relies to a large extent on the lexical-semantic information provided in the Danish wordnet, DanNet. However, we have taken the opportunity to evaluate and curate the wordnet information while compiling the new resource. Some information types have been simplified and more systematically curated. This is the case for the hyponymy relations, the ontological typing, and the sense inventory, i.e. the treatment of polysemy, including systematic polysemy.

 The paper reports on recent developments in Bulgarian BTB-WordNet (BTB-WN). This resource is viewed as playing a central role with respect to the integration and interlinking of various language resources such as: e-dictionaries (morphological, terminological, bilingual, orthographic, etymological and explanatory, etc., including editions from previous periods); corpora (coming from outside or being internal - like the corpus of definitions as well as the corpus of examples to synset meanings); ontologies (such as CIDOC-CRM, DBpedia, etc.); sources of world knowledge (such as information from the Bulgarian Encyclopedia, Wikipedia, etc.). The paper also gives information about a number of applications built on BTB-WN. These are: the Bulgaria-centered knowledge graph, the All about word application as well as some education-oriented exercises.

   Lexicalised and non-lexicalized multi-word expressions in W  ord N  et: a cross-encoder approach    
  Marek Maziarz  | Łukasz Grabowski  | Tadeusz Piotrowski  | Ewa Rudnicka  | Maciej Piasecki    
 Focusing on recognition of multi-word expressions (MWEs), we address the problem of recording MWEs in WordNet. In fact, not all MWEs recorded in that lexical database could with no doubt be considered as lexicalised (e.g. elements of wordnet taxonomy, quantifier phrases, certain collocations). In this paper, we use a cross-encoder approach to improve our earlier method of distinguishing between lexicalised and non-lexicalised MWEs found in WordNet using custom-designed rule-based and statistical approaches. We achieve F1-measure for the class of lexicalised word combinations close to 80%, easily beating two baselines (random and a majority class one). Language model also proves to be better than a feature-based logistic regression model.

   Towards an RDF  Representation of the Infrastructure consisting in using Wordnets as a conceptual Interlingua between multilingual Sign Language Datasets    
  Thierry Declerck  | Thomas Troelsgård  | Sussi Olsen    
 We present ongoing work dealing with a Linked Data compliant representation of infrastructures using wordnets for connecting multilingual Sign Language data sets. We build for this on already existing RDF and OntoLex representations of Open Multilingual Wordnet (OMW) data sets and work done by the European EASIER research project on the use of the CSV files of OMW for linking glosses and basic semantic information associated with Sign Language data sets in two languages: German and Greek. In this context, we started the transformation into RDF of a Danish data set, which links Danish Sign Language data and the wordnet for Danish, DanNet. The final objective of our work is to include Sign Language data sets (and their conceptual cross-linking via wordnets) in the Linguistic Linked Open Data cloud.

 In 2008, the Princeton team released the last version of the “Princeton Annotated Gloss Corpus”. In this corpus. The word forms from the definitions and examples (glosses) of Princeton WordNet are manually linked to the context-appropriate sense in WordNet. However, the annotation was not complete, and the dataset was never officially released as part of WordNet 3.0, remaining as one of the standoff files available for download. Eleven years later, in 2019, one of the authors of this paper restarted the project aiming to complete the sense annotation of the approximately 200 thousand word forms not yet annotated. Here, we provide additional motivations to complete this dataset and report the progress in the work and evaluations. Intending to provide an extra level of consistency in the sense annotation and a deep semantic representation of the definitions and examples promoting WordNet from a lexical resource to a lightweight ontology, we now employ the English Resource Grammar (ERG), a broad-coverage HPSG grammar of English to parse the sentences and project the sense annotations from the surface words to the ERG predicates. We also report some initial steps on upgrading the corpus to WordNet 3.1 to facilitate mapping the data to other lexical resources.

   Context-Gloss Augmentation for Improving A  rabic Target Sense Verification    
  Sanad Malaysha  | Mustafa Jarrar  | Mohammed Khalilia    
 Arabic language lacks semantic datasets and sense inventories. The most common semantically-labeled dataset for Arabic is the ArabGlossBERT, a relatively small dataset that consists of 167K context-gloss pairs (about 60K positive and 107K negative pairs), collected from Arabic dictionaries. This paper presents an enrichment to the ArabGlossBERT dataset, by augmenting it using (Arabic-English-Arabic) machine back-translation. Augmentation increased the dataset size to 352K pairs (149K positive and 203K negative pairs). We measure the impact of augmentation using different data configurations to fine-tune BERT on target sense verification (TSV) task. Overall, the accuracy ranges between 78% to 84% for different data configurations. Although our approach performed at par with the baseline, we did observe some improvements for some POS tags in some experiments. Furthermore, our fine-tuned models are trained on a larger dataset covering larger vocabulary and contexts. We provide an in-depth analysis of the accuracy for each part-of-speech (POS).

   The Open C  antonese Sense-Tagged Corpus    
  Joanna Sio  | Luis Morgado Da Costa    
 This paper introduces the Open Cantonese Sense-Tagged Corpus, a new and ongoing project to serve as the companion to the development of the Cantonese Wordnet. This corpus is built on top of the Cantonese Wordnet Corpus, which currently provides example sentences for most verbs in this wordnet. This paper motivates the choice of starting a sense-tagged corpus from both linguistic and educational perspectives, and discusses the current solutions to issues arisen from the sense-tagging exercise. In total, we have tagged over 5,000 concepts, with more than 3,700 direct links to the Cantonese Wordnet.

   Correcting Sense Annotations Using Wordnets and Translations    
  Arnob Mallik  | Grzegorz Kondrak    
 Acquiring large amounts of high-quality annotated data is an open issue in word sense disambiguation. This problem has become more critical recently with the advent of supervised models based on neural networks, which require large amounts of annotated data. We propose two algorithms for making selective corrections on a sense-annotated parallel corpus, based on cross-lingual synset mappings. We show that, when applied to bilingual parallel corpora, these algorithms can rectify noisy sense annotations, and thereby produce multilingual sense-annotated data of improved quality.

   A Benchmark and Scoring Algorithm for Enriching A  rabic Synonyms    
  Sana Ghanem  | Mustafa Jarrar  | Radi Jarrar  | Ibrahim Bounhas    
 This paper addresses the task of extending a given synset with additional synonyms taking into account synonymy strength as a fuzzy value. Given a mono/multilingual synset and a threshold (a fuzzy value [0−1]), our goal is to extract new synonyms above this threshold from existing lexicons. We present twofold contributions: an algorithm and a benchmark dataset. The dataset consists of 3K candidate synonyms for 500 synsets. Each candidate synonym is annotated with a fuzzy value by four linguists. The dataset is important for (i) understanding how much linguists (dis/)agree on synonymy, in addition to (ii) using the dataset as a baseline to evaluate our algorithm. Our proposed algorithm extracts synonyms from existing lexicons and computes a fuzzy value for each candidate. Our evaluations show that the algorithm behaves like a linguist and its fuzzy values are close to those proposed by linguists (using RMSE and MAE). The dataset and a demo page are publicly available at https://portal.sina.birzeit.edu/synonyms.

   Expanding the Conceptual Description of Verbs in W  ord N  et with Semantic and Syntactic Information    
  Ivelina Stoyanova  | Svetlozara Leseva    
 This paper describes an ongoing effort towards expanding the semantic and conceptual description of verbs in WordNet by combining information from two other resources, FrameNet and VerbNet, as well as enriching the verbs’ description with syntactic patterns extracted from the three resources. The conceptual description of verb synsets is provided by assigning a FrameNet frame which provides the relevant set of frame elements denoting the predicate’s participants and props. This information is supplemented by assigning a VerbNet class and the set of semantic roles associated with it. The information extracted from FrameNet and VerbNet and assigned to a synset is aligned (semi-automatically with subsequent manual corrections) at the following levels: (i) FrameNet frame: VerbNet class; (ii) FrameNet frame elements: VerbNet semantic roles; (iii) FrameNet semantic types and restrictions: VerbNet selectional restrictions. We then link the syntactic patterns associated with the units in FrameNet, VerbNet and WordNet, by unifying their representation and by matching the corresponding patterns at the level of syntactic groups. The alignment of the semantic components and their syntactic realisations is essential for the better exploitation of the abundance of information across resources, including shedding light on cross-resource similarities, discrepancies and inconsistencies. The syntactic patterns can facilitate the extraction of examples illustrating the use of verb synset literals in corpora and their semantic characterisation through the association of the syntactic groups with the components of semantic description (frame elements or semantic roles) and can be employed in various tasks requiring semantic and syntactic description. The resource is publicly available to the community. The components of the conceptual description are visualised showing the links to the original resources each component is drawn from.

   An Experiment: Finding Parents for Parentless Synsets by Means of CILI     
  Ahti Lohk  | Martin Rebane  | Heili Orav    
 Identifying and correcting inconsistencies in wordnets is a natural part of their development. Focusing only on the subproblem of missing links, we aim to find automatically possible parents for parentless synsets in IS-A hierarchies of a target wordnet by means of source wordnets where target and source wordnets are in XML-format and equipped with Collaborative Interlingual Index (CILI). In this paper, we describe the algorithm and provide statistics on the possible parents of parentless synsets of the wordnets included in the study. Additionally, we investigate the suitability of the proposed potential parent synsets for correcting noun and verb synsets within the Estonian wordnet.

   Extending the usage of adjectives in the Z  ulu A  f WN     
  Laurette Marais  | Laurette Pretorius    
 The African languages Wordnet (AfWN) for Zulu (ZWN) was built using the expand approach, which relies on the translation of concepts in the Princeton WordNet (PWN), while retaining their PWN lexical categories. In this paper the focus is on the adjective as PWN lexical category. What is considered adjectival information (provided both attributively and predicatively) in English, is usually verbalised quite differently in Zulu - often as verb or copulative constructions - as may be seen by inspecting the Zulu written forms in “adjective” entries in ZWN. These written forms are not complete Zulu verb or copulative constructions and in order for them to be useful, tense, polarity and agreement have to be added. This paper presents a grammar-based approach to recover important morphosyntactic information implicit in the ZWN “adjective” written forms in order to derive a tool that would assist a user of the ZWN to render and analyse correct full forms automatically as desired by the context in which an “adjective” is used.

   Linking SIL  Semantic Domains to W  ordnet and Expanding the A  bui W  ordnet through Rapid Word Collection Methodology    
  Luis Morgado Da Costa  | František Kratochvíl  | George Saad  | Benidiktus Delpada  | Daniel Simon Lanma  | Francis Bond  | Natálie Wolfová  | A.l. Blake    
 In this paper we describe a new methodology to expand the Abui Wordnet through data collected using the Rapid Word Collection (RWC) method – based on SIL’s Semantic Domains. Using a multilingual sense-intersection algorithm, we created a ranked list of concept suggestions for each domain, and then used the ranked list as a filter to link the Abui RWC data to wordnet. This used translations from both SIL’s Semantic Domain’s structure and example words, both available through SIL’s Fieldworks software and the RWC project. We release both the new mapping of the SIL Semantic Domains to wordnet and an expansion of the Abui Wordnet.

   W  ordnet-oriented recognition of derivational relations    
  Wiktor Walentynowicz  | Maciej Piasecki    
 Derivational relations are an important element in defining meanings, as they help to explore word-formation schemes and predict senses of derivates (derived words). In this work, we analyse different methods of representing derivational forms obtained from WordNet – from quantitative vectors to contextual learned embedding methods – and compare ways of classifying the derivational relations occurring between them. Our research focuses on the explainability of the obtained representations and results. The data source for our research is plWordNet, which is the wordnet of the Polish language and includes a rich set of derivation examples.

   What do Language Models know about word senses? Zero-Shot WSD  with Language Models and Domain Inventories    
  Oscar Sainz  | Oier Lopez de Lacalle  | Eneko Agirre  | German Rigau    
 Language Models are the core for almost any Natural Language Processing system nowadays. One of their particularities is their contextualized representations, a game changer feature when a disambiguation between word senses is necessary. In this paper we aim to explore to what extent language models are capable of discerning among senses at inference time. We performed this analysis by prompting commonly used Languages Models such as BERT or RoBERTa to perform the task of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). We leverage the relation between word senses and domains, and cast WSD as a textual entailment problem, where the different hypothesis refer to the domains of the word senses. Our results show that this approach is indeed effective, close to supervised systems.

   Resolving Multiple Hyperonymy    
  Svetla Koeva  | Dimitar Hristov    
 WordNet contains a fair number of synsets with multiple hyperonyms. In parent–child relations, a child can have only one parent (ancestor). Consequently, multiple hyperonymy represents distinct semantic relations. In order to reclassify the multiple hyperonyms, we define a small set of new semantic relations (such as function, origin and form) that cover the various instances of multiple hyperonyms. The synsets with multiple hyperonyms that lead to the same root and belong to the same semantic class were grouped automatically, resulting in semantic patterns that serve as a point of departure for the classification. The proposed changes are based on semantic analysis and may involve the redefinition of one or several multiple hyperonymy relations to new ones, the removal of one or several multiple hyperonymy relations, and rarely the addition of a new hyperonymy relation. As a result, we incorporate the newly defined semantic relations that resolve the former multiple hyperonymy relations and propose an updated WordNet structure without multiple hyperonyms. The resulting WordNet structure without multiple hyperonyms may be used for a variety of purposes that require proper inheritance.

   Towards the integration of W  ord N  et into C  lin IDM  ap    
  Elena Zotova  | Montse Cuadros  | German Rigau    
 This paper presents the integration of WordNet knowledge resource into ClinIDMap tool, which aims to map identifiers between clinical ontologies and lexical resources. ClinIDMap interlinks identifiers from UMLS, SMOMED-CT, ICD-10 and the corresponding Wikidata and Wikipedia articles for concepts from the UMLS Metathesaurus. The main goal of the tool is to provide semantic interoperability across the clinical concepts from various knowledge bases. As a side effect, the mapping enriches already annotated medical corpora in multiple languages with new labels. In this new release, we add WordNet 3.0 and 3.1 synsets using the available mappings through Wikidata. Thanks to cross-lingual links in MCR we also include the corresponding synsets in other languages and also, extend further ClinIDMap with different domain information. Finally, the final resource helps in the task of enriching of already annotated clinical corpora with additional semantic annotations.

   Connecting Multilingual Wordnets: Strategies for Improving ILI  Classification in O  de N  et    
  Melanie Siegel  | Johann Bergh    
 The Open Multilingual Wordnet (OMW) is an open source project that was launched with the goal to make it easy to use wordnets in multiple languages without having to pay expensive proprietary licensing costs. As OMW evolved, the interlingual indicator (ILI)1 was used to allow semantically equivalent synsets in different languages to be linked to each other. OdeNet2 is the German language wordnet which forms part of the OMW project. This paper analyses the shortcomings of the initial ILI classification in OdeNet and the consequent methods used to improve this classification.

 The International Work-Conference on Artificial Neural Networks ( IWANN  ) is a biennial meeting that, since the first edition in 1991, seeks to provide a discussion forum about systems inspired by nature, focusing, in particular, on trending topics such as Deep Learning and Explainability. Besides conventional talks and special sessions, IWANN 2023 has included complementary activities, such as a tutorial on Deep Learning Interpretability, and a round table to debate the timely topic of Generative Artificial Intelligence.  
 This 17th edition has been held in Azores, Portugal, enriched with the plenary talks by the outstanding researchers Amaury Lendasse (University of Houston, USA) and Alberto Bosio (École Centrale de Lyon, France). More than one hundred papers were been accepted, submitted by authors from over 40 different countries, comprising five continents. Also the strong participation of young researchers is particularly rewarding.  
 The warm atmosphere and relaxed mindset are distinguishing features of IWANN, which often encourage fruitful discussion and further collaboration.

 Janine Strotherm   PhD candidate at Bielefeld University, Germany.     
  Can you tell us a bit about yourself and your research interests?   
 I am Janine Strotherm, a PhD student within the Machine Learning Group of the Technical Faculty at Bielefeld University. Originally, I studied Maths and Physics, but got interested into the applications of Mathematics within the world of Machine Learning (ML). Visiting some of the related lectures, I met my now-supervisor Prof. Dr. Barbara Hammer and joined the project “Water Futures” funded by the European Research Council (ERC) ( https://waterfutures.eu/  ) after finishing my Masters. Within this project, we work on methods in which ML can support tasks within Water Distribution Networks, such as leakage detection. In my case, specifically, I focus on how to introduce the relevant topic of fairness into the domain of ML-assisted Water Distribution Network tasks.  
 What first interested you in this field of research?   
 Guaranteeing access to clean drinking water, Water Distribution Networks display critical infrastructure. At the same time, studies show that water scarcity will be a significant problem in the future. Therefore, if a ML-system makes decisions related to such infrastructure, fairness of such decisions is essential. However, while there exists a lot of research within the domain of water-related ML-systems already, to the best of our knowledge, none of them considered fair ML so far. Also in other human-affecting and ML-based systems, fairness is a highly relevant topic. As the usage of ML in our daily lives increases, this topic seemed quite appealing to me.  
 You won the Best Poster award at IWANN 2023, can you briefly explain the research you presented?   
 The paper which I presented at IWANN 2023 is called “Fairness-Enhancing Ensemble Classification in Water Distribution Networks” and was motivated by the question of how to introduce fairness into mechanisms we already use within the domain of Water Distribution Networks. More specifically, the idea is to make a ML-based leakage detection model, which we proved to not be fair, fair in the sense that the location where the leakage is present has no influence on the quality of the leakage detection. If that was be the case, instead, people living at places where the model detects leakages significantly worse compared to other regions would be discriminated by only the location they live at due to a higher risk of water scarcity, which is considered as unfair. The paper introduces fairness-enhancing algorithms that allow to train models that are fair in this sense.  
 What are you next steps?   
 My current work was a first step on the one hand to introduce the notion of fairness within the domain of Water Distribution Networks and on the other hand to prove that adaptations of well known fairness-enhancing algorithms work in such setting. However, the Water Distribution Network used is a first-step toy network and the leakage detection model is based on rather simple linear ensemble methods. Obvious next steps will be to test the solutions on more realistic networks using more powerful leakage detection models, such as Graph Neural Networks.  
  Moreover, as soon as suitable data will be available, the fairness question will be even more interesting in more relatable fields such as water quality control, network planning or pricing policies using ML.  
  
 El Mahdi Mercha   PhD candidate at ENSIAS, Mohammed V University, Morocco.     
  Can you tell us a bit about yourself and your research interests?   
 I am a fourth-year PhD candidate at ENSIAS. My journey began with a focus on applied mathematics. However, driven by the immense impact of machine learning and deep learning in various domains, I decided to delve into these advancements. Presently, my research revolves around advanced deep learning techniques and graph neural networks for multilingual sentiment analysis including dialects. Broadly, my research interests include information retrieval, computer vision and adversarial machine learning..  
 What first interested you in this field of research?   
 Despite extensive research in sentiment analysis, the predominant focus has been on analyzing sentiment in specific languages. However, given that web users tend to express themselves in their native languages, the content available for analysis is multilingual in nature. Consequently, the need to support sentiment analysis across languages has become increasingly crucial. In light of this, and considering the effectiveness of graph neural networks, I find it particularly interesting to explore the development of multilingual sentiment analysis approaches based on graph neural networks.  
 You won the Best Presentation award at IWANN 2023, can you briefly explain the research you presented?   
 The research work I presented at IWANN 2023 was entitled ”SlideGCN: slightly deep graph convolutional network for multilingual sentiment analysis”. In this work, we propose an approach for multilingual sentiment analysis using a graph convolutional network. We construct a single heterogeneous text graph to model the entire multilingual corpus. The words and documents serve as nodes in the constructed graph. The relationships between these nodes are built based on semantic, sequential, and statistical information. Then, we propose SlideGCN (SLIghtly DEep Graph Convolutional Network), to model the graph. The task of multilingual sentiment analysis is then considered as a node classification problem. The proposed approach can learn insightful representations for words and documents, and it achieves strong classification performance without using external sentiment information.  
 What are you next steps?   
 I intend to generalize our proposed approach to inductive settings. Also, I plan to work on the optimization of the memory consumption in large corpora. In addition, I will conduct more extensive experiments on other new language combinations with new datasets to investigate the robustness of the proposed approach against language variation. Furthermore, I plan to integrate our approach into real big data systems.

 About IITH      
   
 Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad (IITH) is a premier institute of science and technology established in 2008. IITH has been consistently ranked in the top 10 institutes in India for Engineering according to NIRF making it one of the most coveted schools for science and technology in the country. IITH offers undergraduate programs in all the classical engineering disciplines, applied sciences, design, as well as several modern interdisciplinary areas. Students are given a flexibility to explore a broad set of areas, and potentially pursue a minor or double major in a discipline that is not their own. Students who wish to seek a deeper understanding of their own discipline are strongly encouraged to get involved in cutting-edge research with the help of a faculty to mentor them, and earn an Honors in their own field. The very foundation of IIT Hyderabad is based on research and innovation. The vibrant research culture is evident from the number of patents and publications that IITH produces consistently every year. IITH offers graduate programs at both a masters, and a doctoral level, in several diverse areas. There are separate programs for technology, design, science, and liberal arts. The MTech program is offered in various modes and durations to cater to the ever-growing need of postgraduate level professionals in the country. IITH encourages and supports innovation and entrepreneurship at every stage. The minor program in entrepreneurship is open to all students of IITH, and many of the courses are offered by industrialists who are entrepreneurs themselves. There are various innovation centers and incubators that promote entrepreneurship and help mentor young innovators. IITH has been very successful in building tie-ups with leading academic institutions around the globe. IITH enjoys a very special relationship with Japanese universities and industries that goes beyond academic and research collaborations. In fact, some of the iconic buildings in IITH campus will carry the signature of Japanese architecture. IITH creates a unique holistic ecosystem for education that offers interactive learning, a very flexible academic structure, cutting-edge research, strong industry collaboration, and entrepreneurship. This is an environment which enables students and faculty to translate their dreams into realities.

 9th International Workshop on Combinations of Intelligent Methods and Applications (CIMA 2021)-2nd CFP  
  March 23rd, 2021  Daniela Lopez de Luise   
  
 ********************************************************************************     
 SUBMISSION DEADLINE EXTENDED TO 19 APRIL 2021     
 ********************************************************************************     
 9th International Workshop on     
 COMBINATIONS of INTELLIGENT METHODS and APPLICATIONS     
 (CIMA 2021)     
 (URL: http://aigroup.ceid.upatras.gr/cima2021/  )     
 in conjunction with     
 The Twelfth International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems and Applications     
 (IISA 2021)     
 12-14 July 2021, Chania, Greece     
 **********************************************************************************     
 CALL FOR PAPERS     
 *************************************************************************************     
 The combination of different intelligent methods is a very active research area     
 in Artificial Intelligence (AI). The aim is to create integrated or hybrid methods     
 that benefit from each of their components. It is generally believed that complex     
 problems can be easier solved with such integrated or hybrid methods. Some of the     
 existing efforts combine what are called soft computing methods (fuzzy logic,     
 neural networks and genetic algorithms) either among themselves or with more     
 traditional AI technologies such as logic and rules. Another stream of efforts     
 integrates case-based reasoning and machine learning with soft-computing and     
 traditional AI methods. Yet another integrates agent-based approaches with logic     
 and also non-symbolic approaches. Some of the combinations have been quite important     
 and more extensively used, like neuro-symbolic methods, neuro-fuzzy methods and     
 methods combining rule-based and case-based reasoning. However, there are other     
 combinations that are still under investigation, such as those related to the     
 Semantic Web and Deep Learning. In some cases, combinations are based on first     
 principles, but in most cases they are created in the context of specific     
 applications.     
     
 The Workshop is intended to become an annual forum for exchanging experience and     
 ideas among researchers and practitioners who are dealing with combining intelligent     
 methods either based on first principles or in the context of specific applications.     
     
 Topics of interest of the Workshop are (but not limited to):     
     
 Bayesian Networks Integrations     
 Case-Based Reasoning Integrations

 Beschreibung  
   
 The combination of different intelligent methods is a very active research area in Artificial Intelligence (AI). The aim is to create integrated or hybrid methods that benefit from each of their components. The 3rd Workshop on "Combinations of Intelligent Methods and Applications" (CIMA 2012) was intended to become a forum for exchanging experience and ideas among researchers and practitioners who are dealing with combining intelligent methods either based on first principles or in the context of specific applications. CIMA 2012 was held in conjunction with the 22nd European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2012). This volume includes revised versions of the papers presented at CIMA 2012.

 Overview:  
 17th Theoretical Aspects of Software Engineering Conference (TASE 2023) will be held in Bristol, United Kingdom on 4-6 July 2023. TASE 2023 aims to provide a forum for people from academia and industry to communicate their latest results on innovative advances in software engineering. Modern society is increasingly dependent on software systems that are becoming larger and more complex. This poses new challenges to the various aspects of software engineering, for instance, software dependability in trusted computing, interaction with physical components in cyber physical systems, quality assurance in AI-embedded systems, distribution in cloud computing applications, security and privacy in general. Hence, new concepts and methodologies are required to enhance the development of software engineering from theoretical aspects.  
 TASE 2023 is 17th in the TASE series. The past TASE symposia were successfully held in Shanghai ('07), Nanjing ('08), Tianjin ('09), Taipei ('10), Xi'an ('11), Beijing ('12), Birmingham ('13), Changsha('14), Nanjing('15), Shanghai('16), Nice('17), Guangzhou('18), Guilin('19), Hangzhou (’20), Shanghai ('21), Cluj-Napoca ('22).  
 The proceedings of the TASE 2023 symposium will be published in Lecture Notes in Computer Science  (Springer). The authors of a selected subset of accepted papers will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers to a special issue in journal Science of Computer Programming ( https://www.journals.elsevier.com/science-of-computer-programming  ).

  Biography  
   
 I am an Associate Professor at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) where I am heading the Coding and Cryptography (COD) group. I am a recipient of an ERC Starting Grant and the DFG Heinz Maier-Leibnitz-Preis.  
 From 2016 to 2020, I was a Rudolf Mößbauer Tenure Track Assistant Professor at TUM and a Fellow at the TUM Institute for Advanced Study (TUM IAS).  
 From 2013 to 2016, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Computer Science Department of the Technion---Israel Institute of Technology in the group of Tuvi Etzion, Ronny Roth, and Eitan Yaakobi.  
 From 2009 to 2013, I was a PhD student and teaching assistant under the co-supervision of Martin Bossert at the Institute of Communications Engineering, Ulm University, Germany, and Pierre Loidreau at the Institut de Recherche Mathématique de Rennes (IRMAR), Université de Rennes 1, Rennes, France.  
 My main research interests are coding theory, post-quantum cryptography (code- and lattice-based), efficient algorithms, security, privacy, machine learning, and applying error-correcting codes to communications, security, and storage in general, in particular to coded computing, DNA storage, network coding, non-volatile memories, distributed data storage, machine learning, and physical unclonable functions.

  Research Topics  
   
 Post-Quantum Cryptography  
 The recent developments of a quantum supercomputers has motivated research on post-quantum cryptography. Assuming an attack of a sufficiently large quantum computer, several classical public-key algorithms as RSA and elliptic curve cryptography become insecure since computationally intensive mathematical problems become easy-to-solve. It is therefore necessary to design techniques which are secure against an attack of a quantum computer. One approach to achieve this security is code-based cryptography, where encryption and decryption is based on encoding and decoding an algebraic code; another one is based on hard problems in lattices. We investigate and improve post-quantum cryptographic schemes.

  Coding for Insertions/Deletions and DNA Storage  
 The Levenshtein distance, also known as the edit distance, is a measure of similarity between two strings evaluated based on the minimum number of insertion/deletion operations required to transform one string into the other. Codes for correcting insertions and deletions were first proposed for communication applications in the presence of synchronization or sampling errors. However, insertions, deletions, and duplications have particular importance also for numerous applications in bioinformatics such as DNA storage. DNA storage is recently attracting attention as a dense and robust concept for archival storage. The data is written on DNA strands by synthesis and read by DNA sequencing. DNA storage has to cope with sequence losses, loss of ordering of the sequences, and symbol errors such as insertions, deletions and subtitutions.

  Coding for Storage  
 Data storage media like flash memories (used in USB flash drives or solid state drives) suffer from manufacturing imperfections, wearout, and fluctuating read/write errors. In distributed data storage (necessary for cloud storage systems), the most common problem are failures of servers and the task is to reconstruct the lost data efficiently. It is therefore necessary to design coding solutions tailored to these storage applications.

  Network Coding and Rank-Metric Codes  
 The principle of network coding has been attracting growing attention in the recent years as a technique to disseminate information in data networks. The reason for this interest is that network coding achieves higher throughput than routing. In routing, the packets are simply forwarded at each node of the network, whereas in network coding, the nodes perform linear combinations of all packets received so far. Fundamental questions in the area of network coding include assigning appropriate linear combinations to the nodes and choosing a suitable error-correcting code for the case when erroneous packets occur or packets are lost. Rank-metric codes are thereby of relevance, not only for network coding but also for space time codes and code-based cryptography.

  List Decoding  
 List decoding is a major technique for increasing the error correcting capability of codes. The basic idea of list decoding is to return not only a unique decoding result (which is only possible up to half the minimum distance of the corresponding code), but to return all codewords in a certain radius around the received word. This enables us to decode more errors at the cost of a usually small list. Practically, list decoding is used in concatenated coding schemes. Apart from explicit list decoding algorithms, a fundamental question is whether list decoding in a certain metric up to a certain radius can be done in polynomial time.

  Private Information Retrieval  
 Private information retrieval (PIR) studies the problem when a user wants to retrieve a file from a storage system without revealing the identity of the file in question to the storage servers. Private information retrieval (PIR) studies the problem when a user wants to retrieve a file from a storage system without revealing the identity of the file in question to the storage servers. The files that are stored on the servers might be coded (e.g., to prevent server failures) and some servers might be communicating with each other. We investigate PIR schemes that guarantee either information-theoretic privacy or computational privacy.

  Physical Unclonable Functions  
 A Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) is a digital circuit that possesses an intrinsic randomness resulting from process variations. This randomness is exploited to generate random keys for cryptographic applications which can be reproduced on demand. Thus, no embedded physically secure non-volatile memory is needed. However, the regeneration of a key is not perfect due to environmental factors such as temperature variations and aging effects of the digital circuit. These variations can be seen as an erroneous channel and therefore error-correcting codes increase the reliability of key regenerations.

 The keynote speakers of the IWCIA 2022 are: Bhargab Bhattacharia, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India who will give the lecture“Digital Geometry in Medical Diagnostics and Biochemistry” on Wednesday, July 13, 13:30-14:30 (italian time) Benedek Nagy, Eastern Mediterranean University, Famagusta,…   

 Scope   

 Image analysis is a scientific discipline providing theoretical foundations and methods for solving problems appearing in a wide range of areas, as diverse as medicine, robotics, defense, and security. As a rule, the processed data are discrete; therefore, the “discrete approach” to image analysis appears to be a natural one and has an increasing importance. It is based on studying combinatorial properties of the considered digital data sets. Combinatorial image analysis often features various advantages (in terms of efficiency and accuracy) over the more traditional approaches based on continuous models requiring numeric computation.

  IWCT 2023 is to be held in conjunction with ICST 2023, focusing on combinatorial testing. The workshop welcomes academic research submissions, as well as industrial experience reports.  
 Combinatorial Testing (CT), or Combinatorial Interaction Testing (CIT), is a widely applicable generic methodology and technology for software verification and validation, considered a testing best practice. In a combinatorial test plan, all interactions between parameters up to a certain level are covered. For example, in pairwise testing, for every pair of parameters, every pair of values will appear at least once. Studies show that CT is more efficient and effective than random testing.  
 CT has gained significant interest in recent years, both in research and in practice. However, many issues still remain unresolved, and much research is still needed in the field. For example, while pairwise testing is a well recognized and popular test planning method, investigations of actual failures in a number of software and systems convincingly show that pairwise testing is usually not sufficient, so high strength CT (i.e., t-way for t > 2) may be needed.  
 In addition, the combinatorial test plans need to exclude invalid combinations of test values that cannot be executed, which limits the degrees of freedom the algorithms have, thus complicating the problem. Moreover, modeling languages and tools for easily capturing the input test space are also required for real-life applicability of CT. Other obstacles for wide acceptance of CT in industry are the gap between the generated test plans and executable tests, and the difficulty in determining expected results for the generated tests. Finally, empirical studies on CT, as well as thorough comparison with other methods, are also required.  
 In this workshop, we plan to bring together researchers actively working on combinatorial testing, and create a productive and creative environment for sharing and collaboration. IWCT being the primary venue dedicated to CT, yet there are many researchers working in the field, we expect, like in previous years, to see high responsiveness to take part in the workshop. Researchers attending the workshop will have an opportunity to publish their work in a dedicated venue, create new collaborations and take active part in the growing community of researchers working in the field.  
 The workshop will also be a meeting place between academia and industry, thus uniting academic excellence and industrial experience and needs. This will allow participants from academia to learn about the industrial experience in practical application of CT to real-life testing problems, and together with the colleagues from industry identify the difficulties that are obstacle to wider application of CT, and should be addressed in future research. Industrial participants will have an opportunity to meet the leading scientists in the field, and hear about the latest advances and innovations.  
 Combinatorial test competition   
 IWCT will host the second edition of the competition among tools for combinatorial testing - We are still working on the details, some preliminary information is here: https://fmselab.github.io/ct-competition/  . We are working on extending the benchmarks with new categories, please stay tuned.

 Call for Papers  
  
 We invite submissions of high-quality papers presenting original work on both theoretical and experimental aspects of combinatorial testing  (CT)  .   
 Each submitted paper must conform to the IEEE two-column publication format  . All papers will be reviewed by at least three  members from the program committee. If a submission is accepted, at least one author  of the paper is required to attend the workshop  and present the paper  for it to be published in the ICST 2023 workshop proceedings.  
 Submission   
 Submissions are handled via an EasyChair instance provided by ICST for all workshops, authors are kindly asked to select the track ‘International Workshop on Combinatorial Testing’ in the first step: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icstw23   
 Full and short papers   
 We invite submissions for full papers  (up to 8 pages, excluding references) as well as short papers  (up to 4 pages, excluding references). For both of these submission types, pages are not a strict limit, if you need more space please contact the chairs. Accepted papers in these two categories – full and short – will be part of the proceedings of IWCT 2023.  
 Journal-First   
 The aim of the Journal-First (JF)  submission category is to further enrich the program of IWCT, as well as to provide an overall more flexible path to publication and dissemination of original research that is within the scope of IWCT. A submission in this category must adhere to the following criteria:  
 It should be clearly within the scope of the workshop. 
  It should be recent: it should have been accepted and made publicly available in a journal (online or in print) by January 1, 2021 or more recently. 
  It has not been presented at, and is not under consideration for, Journal- First tracks of other conferences or workshops. 
  The submission has to be in the form of a 2-page extended abstract and has to provide a concise summary of the published journal paper. 
  Journal-First submissions must be marked as such in the submission’s title, and must explicitly include full bibliographic details (including a DOI) of the journal publication they are based on. Since the referenced journal papers have already been reviewed and accepted by the corresponding journals, submissions in the JF category will not be reviewed again for technical content. Submissions will be judged on the basis of the above criteria, but also considering how well they would complement the workshop’s technical program. Accepted submissions in this category will be part of the proceedings of IWCT 2023, with the title equal to the original title of the article with the prefix Summary of  .  
 Posters   
 In addition to the traditional program topics from the past years, and taking advantage of the fact that some of the lead CT tool developers have expressed interest in participating again in the second iteration of the CT competition (see below), we would like to offer with the poster session a low-threshold opportunity – especially targeting industry – to present activities within the scope of the workshop to the participants of IWCT. A tool demonstration can be given along a poster. In case a poster contribution wishes to provide more details or information, but does not want to submit a short of full paper, the authors can choose to submit in addition to the poster a maximal 2-page extended abstract detailing the content of the poster. The title of the extended abstract has to have the prefix Extended Abstract of Poster  and these extended abstracts – if accepted – will also appear in the proceedings of IWCT 2023.  
 CT competition   
 IWCT 2023 will also host the 2nd combinatorial testing competition  for combinatorial test generation tools. Details for how to participate can be found here  .  
 Special Issue in Section of Springer Nature Journal   
 We plan to organize a call among the best papers of the workshop to submit extended versions in the Springer Nature Computer Science  journal in the Section Combinatorial Methods and Models in System Testing  . More information will be provided at the workshop.  
 Topics for submissions   
 Topics of interest for submissions include, but are not limited to:  
 Combinatorial testing workflow   
 Modeling the input space for CT – the input to CT algorithms is a set of parameters, respective values, and constraints on value combinations. This input should capture correctly the points of variability in testing the system. While this input is clearly crucial for the effectiveness of CT, it is a difficult problem. 
  Efficient algorithms to generate test suites with small size for t-way testing for t > 2, involving support of constraints on combinations that are possible. 
  Determination of expected system behavior for each test case – while the test cases are automatically generated by the CT algorithm, determining the expected system behavior is currently usually a manual task. 
  Executing CT test suites – the result of CT algorithms is a list of tests, where a test is represented by a value for each parameter. There is still significant effort in transforming this representation into actual tests that a tester or testing tool can execute. 
  Combinatorial testing based fault localization. 
  Implementation of CT in existing testing infrastructures. 
  Handling changes in test requirements – current CT methods focus on onetime generation of a test plan from a given set of requirements. However, test requirements are almost never static, and tend to change between different releases and versions. On the other hand, generating a new set of tests for each release may not be practical either. 
  Real-world experience in deployment of combinatorial testing   
 Empirical studies and feedback from practical applications of CT. 
  Evaluation and return of investment metrics to assess the degree of usefulness of CT. 
  Methodology used for test space modeling and determination of interaction coverage requirements. 
  Discussion of challenges and open problems in the application of CT in industrial settings. 
  Applicability of combinatorial testing   
 Comparison and combination of CT with other dynamic verification methods. 
  Investigation of historical records of failures to determine the kind of CT which may have detected underlying faults. 
  Combinatorial testing for concurrent and real-time systems. 
  CT for testing cloud computing systems and use of combinatorial methods in cloud architecture. 
  Combinatorial testing for AI-based systems. 
  Application of CT in other domains, e.g., information security, study of gene regulation and other biotechnology applications and mechanical engineering. 
  Combinatorial testing of feature models for software product lines. 
  Combinatorial and complementing methods   
 Combinatorial analysis of existing test suites – analyze a test suite not generated by a CT algorithm in light of a combinatorial test space. 
  Test plan reduction and completeness – both under stable, and under changing test requirements. 
  CT and coverage metrics – combining the two, and studying the relation between them.

Liability of the organizers is therefore excluded. The links to other websites have been carefully chosen.

 Call For Papers  
 The aim of this one-day workshop is to bring together researchers who are interested in optimizing database performance on modern computing infrastructure by designing new data management techniques and tools.  
 Topics of Interest  
 The continued evolution of computing hardware and infrastructure imposes new challenges and bottlenecks to program performance. As a result, traditional database architectures that focus solely on I/O optimization increasingly fail to utilize hardware resources efficiently. Multi-core CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, new memory and storage technologies (such as flash and non-volatile memory), and low-power hardware imposes a great challenge to optimizing database performance. Consequently, exploiting the characteristics of modern hardware has become an important topic of database systems research.  
 The goal is to make database systems adapt automatically to the sophisticated hardware characteristics, thus maximizing performance transparently to applications. To achieve this goal, the data management community needs interdisciplinary collaboration with computer architecture, compiler, operating systems and storage researchers. This involves rethinking traditional data structures, query processing algorithms, and database software architectures to adapt to the advances in the underlying hardware infrastructure.  
 We seek submissions bridging the area of database systems to computer architecture, compilers, and operating systems. In particular, submissions covering topics from the following non-exclusive list are encouraged:  
 database algorithms and data structures on modern hardware 
  cost models and query optimization for novel hierarchical memory systems 
  hardware systems for query processing 
  data management using co-processors 
  novel application of new storage technologies to data management 
  query processing using computing power in storage systems 
  database architectures for low-power computing and embedded devices 
  database architectures on multi-threaded and chip multiprocessors 
  performance analysis of database workloads on modern hardware 
  compiler and operating systems advances to improve database performance 
  new benchmarks for micro-architectural evaluation of database workloads 
  taking advantage of modern network capabilities for data processing 
  hardware/software co-design for modern data-intensive workloads (e.g., machine learning, graph analytics) 
  Submission Tracks  
 We invite submissions to two tracks:  
 Full papers: A full paper must be no longer than 6 pages excluding the bibliography. There is no limit on the length of the bibliography. Full papers describe a complete work in the area of data management for new hardware. Accepted papers will be given 10 pages (plus bibliography) for the camera-ready version and a long presentation slot during the workshop. 
  Short Papers: Short papers must not exceed 2 pages excluding the bibliography. Short papers describe very early stage works or summaries of mature systems. Short papers will be included in the proceedings, given 4 pages (plus bibliography) for the camera-ready version, and may be given a short presentation slot during the workshop. 
  All accepted papers (full and short) will also be presented as posters during a workshop poster session.  
 Best of DaMoN 2024  
 This year all accepted DaMoN papers will be considered for a best paper award  .  
 We intend to invite extended versions of a selection of DaMoN'24 papers for submission to the VLDB Journal. Extended papers that are accepted by the VLDB Journal will appear in a special “Best of DaMoN 2024” section within one of the regular VLDBJ issues.  
 Important Dates  
 Paper submission: March 15th, 2024  March 22nd, 2024 (11:59pm PST)  
 Notification of acceptance: April 26th, 2024  April 29th, 2024  
 Camera-ready copies: May 10th, 2024  May 15th, 2024 (23:59pm PST)

 Keynote & Invited Talks  
 Keynote Talk  
 NVMe and Data Systems: A Decade and Counting  
 Philippe Bonnet, IT University of Copenhagen  

 Abstract  : NVMe is synonymous with modern storage. It was introduced as a means to efficiently expose Solid-State Drives as PCIe 3.0 peripherals. With NVMe, I/Os were no longer the bottleneck. Initially, the challenge for operating system and database system designers was to accomodate radically faster storage devices. Then, SSDs evolved to meet a range of cost/performance requirements. Accordingly, NVMe 2.0 introduced new transport models, storage models and cross-layer optimizations. This diversity introduced new challenges. Today, NVMe passthru and Flexible Data Placement enable data systems designers to shape how data is stored, instead of designing their systems around the characteristics of opaque storage devices. Computational storage was supposed to further improve the ability of system designers to specialize storage devices to fit their workloads. However, device memory management became a challenge. We discuss the proposed standard and speculate on the role NVMe may play in future data systems, in a context where CXL emerges, PCIe 7.0 is being standardized and power consumption is the bottleneck.  
 About the Speaker  Philippe Bonnet is professor at DIKU, the department of Computer Science of the University of Copenhagen. He contributed to the uFlip Benchmark, the Linux multiqueue block layer, the Linux framework for Open-Channel SSDs, the OX architecture for computational storage, the xNVMe library and Delilah, a prototype for eBPF offload on computational storage. Philippe is co-author of the book “Principles of Database and Solid State Drive Co-Design” with Alberto Lerner. He is currently trustee of the VLDB endowment and chair of the ACM EIG on Reproducibility and Replicability.   Invited Talk  
 Computer Architecture in Flux: The Central Processing Unit Is No Longer Central  
 David Patterson, University of California Berkeley  

 Abstract  : We start with a review of the instability of modern hardware, given the  
 slowing of Moore’s Law, 
  the end of Dennard scaling, and 
  the rise of the demand for AI cycles versus traditional applications. 
  Data is becoming more critical than compute due to its increasing cost and slowing capacity curves for memory and storage. Data location and movement are now central to cost and performance. To build robust systems in light of these changes, we must shift the focus of hardware and software design from processing to the memory, storage, and network components.  
 About the Speaker  David Patterson  is a UC Berkeley Pardee professor emeritus, a Google distinguished engineer, and the RISC-V International  Vice-Chair. His most influential Berkeley projects likely were RISC  (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) and RAID  (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks). His best-known book is Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach  . He and his co-author John Hennessy  shared the 2017 ACM A.M Turing Award  and the 2022 NAE Charles Stark Draper Prize for Engineering  . The Turing Award is often referred to as the “Nobel Prize of Computing” and the Draper Prize is considered a “Nobel Prize of Engineering.”   Fresh Thinking Talk  
 Effortless Locality Through On-the-fly Data Transformation  
 Manos Athanassoulis, Boston University  

 Abstract  : What if we could access any layout and ship only the relevant data through the memory hierarchy by transparently converting rows to (arbitrary groups of) columns? We capitalize on the reinvigorated trend of hardware specialization to propose Relational Fabric, a near-data vertical partitioner that allows memory or storage components to perform on-the-fly transparent data transformation. By exposing an intuitive API, Relational Fabric pushes vertical partitioning to the hardware, which has a profound impact on the process of designing and building data systems. (A) There is no need for data duplication and layout conversion, making hybrid systems viable using a single layout. (B) It simplifies the memory and storage manager. (C) It reduces unnecessary data movement through the memory hierarchy allowing for better hardware utilization and, ultimately, better performance. In this talk, I will introduce the Relational Fabric vision and present our initial results on in-memory systems. I will also share some of the challenges of building this hardware and the opportunities it brings for simplicity and innovation in the data system software stack, including physical design, query processing, and concurrency control, and conclude with ongoing work for data transformation for general workloads including matrix and tensor processing.  
 About the Speaker  Manos Athanassoulis is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Boston University, Director and Founder of the BU Data-intensive Systems and Computing Laboratory and co-director of the BU Massive Data Algorithms and Systems Group. His research is in the area of data management focusing on building data systems that efficiently exploit modern hardware (computing units, storage, and memories), are deployed in the cloud, and can adapt to the workload both at setup time and, dynamically, at runtime. Before joining Boston University, Manos was a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Manos obtained his PhD from EPFL, Switzerland, and spent one summer at IBM Research, Watson. Manos’ work is published in top conferences and journals of the community, like ACM SIGMOD, PVLDB, ACM TODS, VLDBJ, and others, and has been recognized by awards like “Best Demonstration” in VLDB 2023, “Best of SIGMOD” in 2017, “Best of VLDB” in 2010 and 2017, and “Most Reproducible Paper” at SIGMOD in 2016. Manos has been acting as a program committee member and technical reviewer in top data management conferences and journals for the past 12 years, having received the “Distinguished PC Member Award” for SIGMOD 2018 and SIGMOD 2023. He is currently an associate editor for ACM SIGMOD Record, co-chair of ACM SIGMOD 2023 Availability and Reproducibility, and co-chair of ICWE 2023 Industrial Track. His work is supported by several awards, including an NSF CRII award, an NSF CAREER award, a Facebook Faculty Research Award, multiple RedHat Collaboratory Research Incubation Awards, and a Cisco Research Award.
