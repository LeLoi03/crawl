 Conference Theme  
 Ghost in the machine  
 Artificial life seeks to unravel the mysteries of life and mind, to naturalise the “ghost in the machine” . What is life? What is the mind? Are these two concepts related?  
   
  These ghosts are however elusive, and difficult to identify or even just define at times. To try and learn more about the mind, research in artificial life and other related fields has more recently focused on studies of complexity, emergence,agency, autonomy, or information theory. As a results, this has led to major advancements in robotics, synthetic biology and artificial intelligence, among others. The main research programs in these areas however seem to be simply forgetting about the mind, rather than trying to explain it.  
   
  At the same time, with the advent of new technologies such as brain-machine interface, cyborgization, virtual/augmented reality and the metaverse, the boundaries between agents/living organisms and their environment have began fluctuating. Minds are no longer in our (living organism) shells, expanding beyond current spatial boundaries and into a new form of the “extended mind” hypothesis. At ALIFE 2023, we will bring back the focus to studies of the mind, facing the challenges and embracing the opportunities that come with studies of an often neglected but ever so important concept in both artificial life research and our daily lives.

 IEEE Symposium on Adaptive Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning (IEEE ADPRL)  
  
 Adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) and reinforcement learning (RL) are two related paradigms for solving decision making problems where a performance index must be optimized over time. ADP and RL methods are enjoying a growing popularity and success in applications, fueled by their ability to deal with general and complex problems, including features such as uncertainty, stochastic effects, and nonlinearity.  
  ADP tackles these challenges by developing optimal control methods that adapt to uncertain systems over time. A user-defined cost function is optimized with respect to an adaptive control law, conditioned on prior knowledge of the system and its state, in the presence of uncertainties. A numerical search over the present value of the control minimizes a nonlinear cost function forward-in-time providing a basis for real-time, approximate optimal control. The ability to improve performance over time subject to new or unexplored objectives or dynamics has made ADP successful in applications from optimal control and estimation, operation research, and computational intelligence.  
  RL takes the perspective of an agent that optimizes its behavior by interacting with its environment and learning from the feedback received. The long-term performance is optimized by learning a value function that predicts the future intake of rewards over time. A core feature of RL is that it does not require any a priori knowledge about the environment. Therefore, the agent must explore parts of the environment it does not know well, while at the same time exploiting its knowledge to maximize performance. RL thus provides a framework for learning to behave optimally in unknown environments, which has already been applied to robotics, game playing, network management and traffic control.  
  The goal of the IEEE Symposium on ADPRL is to provide an outlet and a forum for interaction between researchers and practitioners in ADP and RL, in which the clear parallels between the two fields are brought together and exploited. We equally welcome contributions from control theory, computer science, operations research, computational intelligence, neuroscience, as well as other novel perspectives on ADPRL. We host original papers on methods, analysis, applications, and overviews of ADPRL. We are interested in applications from engineering, artificial intelligence, economics, medicine, and other relevant fields.

 ALIFE 2023: The International Conference on Artificial Life. Sapporo - Japan, 24th-28th July 2023.     
   
 From sites  .google  .com  -  November 29, 2022 1:01 AM      
          Conference Theme: Ghosts in the machine  
  Artificial life seeks to unravel the mysteries of life and mind, to naturalise the “ghosts in the machine”. What is life? What is the mind? Are these two concepts related?  
 These ghosts are however elusive, and difficult to identify or even just define at times. To try and learn more about the mind, research in artificial life and other related fields has more recently focused on studies of complexity, emergence, agency, autonomy, or information theory. As a results, this has led to major advancements in robotics, synthetic biology and artificial intelligence, among others. The main research programs in these areas however seem to be simply forgetting about the mind, rather than trying to explain it.  
 At the same time, with the advent of new technologies such as brain-machine interface, cyborgization, virtual/augmented reality and the metaverse, the boundaries between agents/living organisms and their environment have began fluctuating. Minds are no longer in our (living organism) shells, expanding beyond current spatial boundaries and into a new form of the "extended mind" hypothesis. At ALIFE 2023, we will bring back the focus to studies of the mind, facing the challenges and embracing the opportunities that come with studies of an often neglected but ever so important concept in both artificial life research and our daily lives.

 Complex thinking and artificial intelligence, Octobe  r 28, 2024, Online     
   
 From ces  .uc  .pt  - September 11, 9:40 PM      
 Workshop | October 28, 2024, 13h00-19h30 (GMT+1), Online  

 Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have also opened new possibilities for Human-AI interaction towards systems of co and augmented intelligence. On the other hand, developments regarding the practice of complex thinking, as a mode of coupling with the world that is organisationally coherent with the properties that organise complex natural and social systems, has been proposed as potentially leading to more effective ecosystemically positive and sustainable possibilities for action. It is hypothesised that more complex modes of thinking may lead to creative and abductive leaps capable of guiding effective interventions and the process of managing change in “real-world” complex systems, in conditions of uncertainty and risk. The CT & AI project will explore possibilities and limits of the interaction of a framework for the practice and promotion of Complex Thinking (CT) with AI tools based on LLMs (e.g. Chat GPT, Gemini). It aimed at developing and evaluating preliminary protocols to guide the integration of methods and tools for promoting CT with the use of AI tools towards generating complex understandings for practice and research. Finally, it aimed at exploring stakeholders (policy-makers, practitioners, scientists/academics) stances regarding the use of AI in relation to CT.

 School on Biological Physics across Scales: Pattern Formation. November 11 – 22, 2024, São Paulo, Brazil     

 From www  .ictp-saifr  .org  - August 8, 8:01 PM      
  
 Systems as different as the cellular cytoskeleton, microbial communities in soil, and savanna landscapes have in common the emergence of patterns: random yet organized spatial structures that form in an otherwise translationally invariant space. These structures emerge due to the local, individual-level interactions of agents – proteins, cells, trees – that, on a larger scale, result in nonlinear dynamics for the density field. Crucial phenomena hinge on the formation of these patterns: mitosis, embryo development, bacterial population survival, ecosystem’s robustness to aridification.  
 While broadly different in scale, these systems can be theoretically described by similar statistical physics frameworks, an approach pioneered by Alan Turing in 1952 and still the focus of very active development. The goal of this school is to bring together experts on these different systems using mathematical modeling, experimental approaches and modern data-driven techniques to engage in an interdisciplinary dialogue about pattern formation in living systems.  
 There is no registration fee and limited funds are available for travel and local expenses.

 ICTP – SAIFR » School on Active Matter     

 From www  .ictp-saifr  .org  - June 11, 11:16 PM      
 Date:  September 30 – October 4, 2024   
   
 Venue:  IFT-UNESP, São Paulo, Brazil   
   
 Active matter describes systems whose constituent elements consume energy locally in order to move or to exert mechanical forces. As such, active matter systems are intrinsically out of thermodynamic equilibrium. Examples include flocks or herds of animals, collections of cells, components of the cellular cytoskeleton and even artificial microswimmers. Active matter is a rapidly growing field involving diverse scientific communities in physics, biology, computational sciences, applied mathematics, chemistry, and engineering. Numerous applications of active matter are constantly arising in biological systems, smart materials, precision medicine, and robotics.  
   
  This school is intended for graduate students and researchers interested in the physics of active matter. The lectures will cover well-tested and successful theoretical approaches as well as a discussion of experimental results. To achieve this purpose, leading experts will present lectures on fundamental aspects of active matter and a pedagogical exposition of its recent trends.  
   
  Applicants are invited to submit abstracts for poster presentations.  
   
  There is no registration fee and limited funds are available for travel and local expenses.

 Eleventh International Conference on Guided Self-Organization (GSO-2025)     

 From www  .guided-self  .org  - May 29, 12:12 AM      
 ​"Guided Self-Organization: Machine Learning in Embodied Agents"  
  The 11th International Conference on Guided Self-Organization takes place during 12-14 February 2025 in Tübingen, Germany. GSO-2025 is organized by The University of Tübingen, The Hamburg University of Technology, The Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, and The International Association for Guided Self-Organization (TIA-GSO).  
  Research Aims and Topics  
  The goal of Guided Self-Organization (GSO) is to leverage the strengths of self-organization (simplicity, parallelization, adaptability, robustness, scalability) while still being able to direct the outcome of the self-organizing process. GSO typically has the following features: (i) an increase in organization (structure and/or functionality) over some time; (ii) the local interactions are not explicitly guided by any external agent; (iii) task-independent objectives are combined with task-dependent constraints.  
 GSO "aims to regulate self-organization for specific purposes, so that a dynamical system may reach specific attractors or outcomes. The regulation constrains a self-organizing process within a complex system by restricting local interactions between the system components, rather than following an explicit control mechanism or a global design blueprint." Information theory, nonlinear dynamics and network theory are core to many of these methods, and quantifying complexity, its sources and effects is a common theme.  
  ​  
  The GSO-2025 conference will bring together invited experts and researchers in machine learning, artificial life, self-organizing systems, and complex adaptive systems, with particular emphasis on autonomous agents, information theory, critical phenomena and emergent behaviour. Special topics of interest include: reinforcement learning, intrinsic motivations, origin of life, systems biology, physics of life, unconventional computation, swarm intelligence, measures of complexity, criticality, complex networks, information-driven self-organization (IDSO), etc.  
 The program includes three days, with five keynote talks, and a number of regular onsite presentations on each day. There are no registration fees for the conference.

 ICTP – SAIFR » School on Water: From the Anomalies to the Biological and Technological Applications     

 From www  .ictp-saifr  .org  - May 9, 5:49 AM      
 School on Water: From the Anomalies to the Biological and Technological Applications    
   
 Date:  September 2 – 7, 2024   
   
 Venue:  IFT-UNESP, São Paulo, Brazil   
   
 We can all agree that a liquid that occupies 70 percent of Earth’s surface and two-thirds of our body is very important. Do we already know everything about water? Water has more than 70 thermodynamic, dynamic and structural anomalies and also shows new strange behavior upon analysis of the biological or material nanostructures. For instance, at nanoconfinement, water violates the hydrodynamic equations. Since water is present everywhere, understanding how the anomalies affect different systems is relevant. In this school, we explore the water anomalies starting from the basic ideas of phase transitions and critical phenomena, and show how they can be measured from scattering experiments and simulations of the nanoscale results.  
   
  There is no registration fee and limited funds are available for travel and local expenses.   

 Lecturers:    
 Gustavo Appignanesi | (Universidad Nacional del Sur, Argentina): | Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Surfaces and Interfaces 
  Marcia Barbosa | (UFRGS, Brazil): | Nanoconfined Water

 Workshop: Demystifying machine learning for population researchers. November 5-6, Rostock, Germany     
   
 From www  .demogr  .mpg  .de  - April 30, 9:51 PM      
 Advances in computational power and statistical algorithms, in conjunction with the increasing availability of large datasets, have led to a Cambrian explosion of machine learning (ML) methods. For population researchers, these methods are useful not only for predicting population dynamics but also as tools to improve causal inference tasks. However, the rapid evolution of this literature, coupled with terminological disparities from conventional approaches, renders these methods enigmatic and arduous for many population researchers to grasp.  
 This workshop on November 5 to 6, 2024 at the Max Planck Intsitute for Demographic Research (MPIDR) in Rostock, Germany, clarifies the goals, techniques, and applications of machine learning methods for population research. The workshop covers  
 an introduction to ML methods for population researchers, 
  showcases of ML applications to answer causal questions, 
  discussions of the current developments of ML for population health, fertility and family dynamics, and 
  fosters critical discussions about the shortfalls of these techniques. 
  The main focus of this workshop is on ML techniques using quantitative population data and research questions, not on ML language models. The workshop consists of keynotes, contributed sessions, and a tutorial.

 School on Modelling Infectious Disease Dynamics. May 6 – 12, 2024. São Paulo, Brazil     

 From www  .ictp-saifr  .org  - February 27, 11:02 PM      
  
 The recent COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the power of modeling to support policymaking. However, most South American countries lack capacity in the field of modeling. This seven-day school will address how modeling allows us to use the health resources we currently have more efficiently, increasing their impact, improving people’s well-being, and saving lives as a result. The school includes a course on epidemic models, on numerical treatment of models and on epidemiological data analysis, and will be focused on group work involving “hands-on” modeling challenges. There will be classes in the morning and group projects in the afternoon. Participants from all areas related to the subject are welcome to apply. Knowledge of basic differential calculus is required.

 ICTP – SAIFR » Minicourse on Bayesian Machine Learning for Scientific Research     

 From www  .ictp-saifr  .org  - September 11, 9:42 PM      
  
 October 28 – November 1, 2024  
 São Paulo, Brazil  
 ICTP-SAIFR/IFT-UNESP  

 We will present five 3-hour lectures that will introduce participants to the world of Bayesian Machine Learning for scientific purposes. The minicourse is tailored to suit both senior and junior researchers, catering to their respective levels of experience and interest.  
   
  In the first block of each lecture, we aim to transmit the big picture of the lecture’s topic with a focus on the details from a supervising point of view. The fine points and subtleties will be addressed here, but without strict demonstrations or supplied code. This block is intended for both seniors and juniors: for seniors as a summary that shows how to apply these tools to scientific research; and for juniors as an entrance to the second block in which we put our hands in the dough. We conclude the block with an extended coffee break where we expect that the proposed ideas trigger discussions around each participant’s field of study and how to apply it in their data.  
   
  The second block is very hands-on and is intended for juniors, but seniors interested in getting actively involved in the calculations are welcome as well. We present, discuss and write code. Participants are engaged in coding exercises and discussing practical applications. This block emphasizes practical skills and real-world problem-solving. We use different libraries, and we deploy statistical software especially designed to tackle the presented problems  
   
  The minicourse is generally designed for any scientific career. We use mostly physics examples, but the material will be useful and insightful for any other field with hard scientific research. We will try to adapt and discuss the problems within the participants’ fields of research.  
   
  Participants are expected to have taken courses in algebra and analysis, be familiar with multi-dimensional vectors and expressions, have some knowledge of probability and statistics, and be prepared for non-trivial abstract reasoning and thinking. Juniors, in addition, are expected to have some knowledge of Python.  
   
  There is no registration fee and limited funds are available for local expenses.

 From css  .lakecomoschool  .org  - February 5, 10:23 AM      
  
 May 13-17, 2024 Villa del Grumello, Como, Italy  
 Over the past decade, computational social science (CSS) has risen as an interdisciplinary field that combines methods and theories from computer science, statistics, and social sciences to study complex social phenomena using computational tools and techniques.   

 By leveraging the power of computing and data, computational social scientists aim to uncover patterns and trends in complex social systems that may be difficult or impossible to discern through traditional research methods.   

 Topics of interest include social networks, online communities, opinion dynamics, and collective decision-making, among others. Computational social science has become increasingly important as our world becomes more digitised, and its insights have significant implications for fields such as public policy, marketing, and sociology.   

 The First edition of the school  Computational Social Science: Advances, Challenges and Opportunities  is designed to provide an intensive and immersive learning experience for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and early career faculty interested in utilising computational methods to study social phenomena.   
 The school will be open to  45 selected students.  Application deadline: February 25th  , 2024

 SCOPE AND OVERVIEW  
 IEEE WoWMoM 2023 is soliciting original and previously unpublished papers addressing research challenges and advances in the areas of wireless, mobile, and multimedia networking as well as ubiquitous and pervasive systems and applications. Wireless networking technologies are continuously evolving and have become a critical part of modern life, be it for communication services, media distribution, or sensing and actuation services within the Internet of Things (IoT) context. Appropriate resource management, application design, and architectural networking paradigms are necessary to provide users with high quality experience in multimedia communication and services. Edge computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are becoming essential tools to cope with the increasing diversity of connected devices and the plethora of new data-intensive and latency-sensitive applications. At the same time, the interoperability among IoT environments (including wearable computing and sensors), the network edge, and the cloud are evolving towards an fog-edge-cloud continuum that is expected to support a wide range of application domains and services in a more smooth and efficient manner. In this context, providing rich sets of measurements for characterizing, and understanding the behavior of such complex systems is of paramount importance.  
 IEEE WoWMoM 2023 takes a broad view and seeks papers describing innovative research contributions to the field of mobile and wireless networking and applications. We solicit papers that present original work, validated by experimentation, simulation, or analysis. We also welcome practical experiences and experimental efforts from both industry and academia, duly documenting the lessons learned from testbeds, field trials, or real deployments.

  IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory 

 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory    

 The IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory, or ISIT, is the flagship conference of the IEEE Information Theory Society. The symposium centers around the presentation of previously unpublished contributions in all of the areas of information theory, including source and channel coding, communication theory and systems, cryptography and security, detection and estimation, networks, pattern recognition and learning, statistics, stochastic processes and complexity, and signal processing. Furthermore, it provides an open forum to discuss and exchange with other researchers on any of these topics.  
 The highlight of ISIT the Shannon Lecture, given by that year's holder of the Shannon Award. The following year's Shannon Award winner is also announced at ISIT.  
 Some people pronounce ISIT as eye-es-eye-tee. Others pronounce it eye-sit. Both pronunciations are acceptable.  
 The list below includes ISITs since 2001. The list of previous event has ISITs since 1950  .

  IEEE ISORC  was founded in 1998 (with its first meeting in Kyoto, Japan) to address research into the application of real-time object-oriented distributed technology. Since then, ISORC has continually evolved to meet the latest challenges faced by researchers and practitioners in the real-time domain with an emphasis on object-, component- and service-oriented systems and solutions.  
 ISORC is a single-track conference,  with a lively community. We have hosted a number of associated workshops, and are proud of our spirit of openness. We seek to encourage diverse views and new approaches to all Real-Time Issues and Challenges for novel applications and systems in RT computing issues.  
 Papers are to be submitted through the HotCRP system  .  
 For our 23rd symposium, we are meeting in USA,  in the city of Nashville  , Tennessee from May 23 - 25, 2023  . Our meetings will take place at Vanderbilt University School of Engineering (Featheringill Hall Auditorium room 134).   . For more information on IEEE ISORC 2023 and its location, calls for papers, workshops, and events, please use the menu bar at the top of the screen of the main page.

 Speaker: Prof. Sanjoy Baruah 
 Title: Explainable Safety 
 Abstract 
 Safety-critical systems should have their safety properties authoritatively established before they are considered for deployment. If this safety validation is performed via "black-box" methods (e.g., ones based on Deep Learning and related techniques) that are difficult for humans to comprehend, then an accompanying explanation should be provided as to why one may trust that the claim that safety has been validated. But what constitutes an acceptable explanation, and how do we verify the veracity of such explanations? -- these issues will be investigated in this presentation, with a particular focus on the explainability of safety properties relating to timing correctness (i.e., schedulability). 
 Bio: Prof. Sanjoy Baruah 
 Dr. Sanjoy Baruah is Ina Champ Urbauer Professor at the department of Computer Science and Engineering Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA  
  Dr. Sanjoy Baruah (Fellow, IEEE) was with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA, from 1999 to 2017, and The University of Vermont, Burlington, VT, USA from 1993 to 1999. He joined the Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA, in September 2017. His research interests and activities are in real-time and safety-critical system design, scheduling theory resource allocation and sharing in distributed computing environments, and algorithm design and analysis. He is a Fellow of the IEEE, and the recipient of the 2014 Outstanding Technical Contributions and Leadership Award of the IEEE Technical Committee on Real-Time Systems.

  Submission Types and Procedures  
 Notes & Briefs  
 ISWC accepts contributions of original, unpublished research in two lengths. Papers are published and archived in the ACM Digital  Library  .  
 Notes   :  novel, rigorous research contributions of smaller scope than full papers submissions to IMWUT  . Notes should reflect a more narrow research question, but not reflect early-stage (e.g. pilot, under-developed) research, or preliminary technological development without a robust evaluation.  Notes should not exceed 4 pages in the 2-column, ACM proceedings format  (please refer to the UbiComp/ISWC templates and formatting  ). References do not count to the page limit (i.e. references can be on pages 5+), but it is important that the core paper including all text and figures  is in the first 4 pages. Appendices are not allowed.  
 Briefs   :  novel research contributions of a narrow scope. Briefs should include system or technology development with limited evaluation. Briefs should not exceed 2 pages in the 2-column, ACM proceedings format  (please refer to the UbiComp/ISWC templates and formatting  ). References do not count to the page limit (i.e. references can be on pages 3+), but it is important that the core paper including all text and figures  is in the first 2 pages. Appendices are not allowed.  
 Former “  Long Papers”   : Since ISWC and UbiComp have started co-hosting the conference, papers formerly known as “Long papers” must be submitted via the IMWUT journal system  . IMWUT has 4 submission deadlines a year (15 February, 15 May, 15 August, 15 November). When submitting to IMWUT, please make sure you tick the “Wearable” checkbox  as it helps allocate the papers to suitable Associate Editors. More information about IMWUT submissions and their presentation is available here  .  
 ISWC 2023 contributions will be presented at the UbiComp/ISWC 2023 conference in Cancun, Mexico  , October 8-12, 2023   
 *ISWC Notes & Briefs, as any other track at UbiComp/ISWC 2023, will be in-person only.  
  More details for exceptions can be found here  .   
    
 Template for the Submission  
 Please refer to the UbiComp/ISWC template and formatting  .  
 Submission, Reviewing and Camera-ready Procedures  
 All papers should be sent through the submission site available through the Precision Conference System (PCS)  .  
 Double-blind review   :  ISWC follows a double-blind review process, and the anonymization policy of ACM IMWUT  should be observed. Therefore, submit your papers without identifying information (i.e. it must be anonymized), including author names and pay attention when citing prior work to use a style which does not lend to easy identification of the authors (i.e. in third person). For instance, instead of “In our previous work we showed….” one could write “It was recently shown that … [ref]”. Authors must leave citations to their previous work unanonymized to allow reviewers to ensure that the existing literature has been adequately taken into account. Any link to codes or visual materials (e.g., videos, images) needs to be anonymized too.  
 Accepted papers:   final edits (in alignment with reviewer comments) will be prepared by the authors for submission on the Camera Ready Deadline  .  
 Shepherded papers   :  those are papers which require very specific changes identified by reviewers and the program committee members. They are considered to be conditionally accepted, subject to the authors modifying their paper to address specific shepherding comments. These may fall in two categories. Some papers may be requested to be revised in a shorter format (e.g. from Notes to Briefs), while others may be requested to be revised in the same format. A shepherd will guide the authors to ensure that the required changes are adequately completed. Revision timelines will be agreed between the shepherd and authors, but must be fully complete and approved by the shepherd by the Shepherding Acceptance Deadline  and then readied for the Camera Ready Deadline  .  
 Rejected papers   : Some rejected papers may be invited for submission as posters or demonstrations at the UbiComp/ISWC 2023 Conference.  
 Desk Rejects   :  Papers out of the scope of ISWC or without appropriate anonymization may be rejected without reviews.  
 All papers well suited for the format may also be invited for an additional submission as a demonstration at the UbiComp/ISWC 2023 conference  .  
 Reviewing Criteria  
 All papers are reviewed based on their scientific merit and contribution to the scientific progress in the domain of wearable technology. Submissions should demonstrate novelty (contribution above the state of the art); impact (contribution that furthers the state of the art in meaningful and significant ways, that can be translated and applied to new contexts); and rigor (contribution that is thoroughly supported with well-constructed evidence).  
 For authors to get a sense of what the ISWC community likes to see in papers we may suggest consulting the 2023 ISWC Author Guide  .

 ASSET Symposium  Manas Bedmutha    2023-04-21T05:35:44+00:00  UbiComp / ISWC 2023   
  ASSET  Symposium   

 Submission Deadlines:  
 1st round: | May 15th | , Notification | June 1st 
  2nd round: | July 1st | , Notification | July 15th 

 UbiComp/ISWC 2023 is featuring a special program called ASSET ( A  mericas S  tudent S  ymposium on E  merging T  echnologies) as part of SIGMOBILE’s student outreach program. Student participating to ASSET will be divided into small groups and each group will be provided with an excellent and dynamic research mentor who will help them hone their research skills.   
 Students accepted into the ASSET program will participate to the pre-conference ASSET Symposium, and will receive full financial support to attend UbiComp/ISWC 2023.   
 Goals  
 In particular, ASSET is designed to help students improve their research skills in four ways:  
 Improve students’ ability to present their ideas in written form by working on and continuously improving a 1-page summary of their research plan ⇒ This will improve their ability to write research papers 
  Improve students’ ability to present their ideas by offering each participant the opportunity to present their research ideas in the form of a poster at the main conference poster presentation session ⇒ This will improve their ability to raise other researchers’ interest in their research work when they are given time to present the details 
  Improve students’ ability to present a quick 30s summary (aka “elevator pitch”) of their research by asking each participant to summarize their research to their research mentor every day ⇒ This will improve their ability to convince people that their research ideas are worth listening to! 
  Improve students’ ability to understand and appreciate world class research by attending the talks and presentations at UbiComp/ISWC and interacting with the UbiComp/ISWC attendees (a “who’s who” of Ubiquitous and Wearable Computing researchers from around the world!) ⇒ This will spark new ideas and collaborations with students, faculty, and industry researchers from top universities and companies located around the world. It will also energize students’ desire to conduct world class research while being immersed in a world class research environment for the entire ASSET stay. 
  Venue  
 We are co-locating ASSET with UbiComp/ISWC as it is the premier  research conference for Ubiquitous and Wearable Computing research. As such, world-class researchers from all the top universities and industry research labs (e.g. Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.) will attend. In addition, many graduate students from around the world will also attend making this a perfect venue to start collaborative research with like-minded research individuals.  
 Previous Runs  
 This will be the 4th incarnation of ASSET with the first two being in Asia, and the last two in Latin America.  
 ASSET 2016 co-located with MobiSys in Singapore 
  ASSET 2018 co-located with COMSNETS in Bengalaru, India 
  ASSET 2019 co-located with MobiCom in Los Cabos, Mexico 
  ASSET 2023 co-located with UbiComp/ISWC in Cancun, Mexico 
  The huge success of previous versions has given us the drive to continue running ASSET and UbiComp/ISWC being held in Mexico was a perfect opportunity to do so.  
 How to attend ASSET?  
 Slots are limited to just 20 graduate student participants  (preference given to Ph.D. students) — preferably from Mexico, Central, and South America. Interested graduate students should submit their request via this online form    by the deadline. We ask students to provide:   
 1 page CV 
  1 page research statement 
  A short explanation (a few sentences) for why you want to attend ASSET and how it will benefit you (please note the selection criteria below and provide answers accordingly) 
  A support letter from your advisor explaining why they think you will benefit from ASSET 
  Deadline to submit ASSET applications is May 15th and July 1st. Notification of acceptance and travel support is June 1st and July 15th.  
     
 Selection Criteria  
 We anticipate that ASSET will be in high demand and our priority is to ensure that travel grants can help us broaden participation of the historically underrepresented community in the conference. In particular, our primary goal is to provide opportunities to students who have never attended a top-tier research conference before and are from underrepresented universities and communities.  
 We highly encourage participation from local universities as well as any institution within South American region.   
 ASSET Scholarships  
 Every student participant selected for ASSET will be provided a special scholarship, courtesy of ACM SIGMOBILE, to attend.  
 What is covered:   
 5 nights stay at a UbiComp/ISWC 2023 conference hotel 
  Double sharing single-sex rooms most likely 
  All food and beverages provide by the conference will be included 
  All conference and workshop fees for UbiComp/ISWC 2023. This allows entry to both workshop days and the entire conference and all events 
  There will also be a transportation allowance provided. The exact amount will be announced later 
  The total value of the support provided to each student is slightly more than USD $1,000 
  What is not covered:   
  Any other costs that are not included as part of the conference package

  Guidelines for Manuscripts  
 IEEE ISORC 2023 invites papers in three categories, all will be published in the IEEE proceeding. Submission guidelines for each category of paper are as follows:  
 Regular Research Papers:  Papers should describe original work and papers submitted for review should be a maximum of 10 pages in length, excluding references, using the IEEE conference paper format. A maximum of two extra pages may be purchased during the camera-ready submission of accepted papers. 
  Industrial Papers and Practitioner Reports:  Papers describing experiences of using ORC technology in application or tool development projects, are an integral part of the technical program of ISORC. These papers should be no longer than 10 pages, excluding references, using the IEEE conference paper format and may be less formal than research papers. They should clearly identify and discuss in detail the issues that represent notable industrial advances. Reports with project metrics supporting their claims are particularly sought, as well as those that show both benefits and drawbacks of the approaches used in the given project. 
  Short Papers:  Short research papers that are no longer than 6 pages, excluding references, using the IEEE conference paper format, on real-time analytics are also invited, and should contain enough information for the program committee to understand the scope of the project and evaluate the novelty of the problem or approach. 
  The IEEE conference paper templates  can be found here  .  
  
 Papers are to be submitted through the HotCRP system  .  
 Acceptance Criteria  
 The review process is double blinded  . Authors' identifiers, including name, affiliation and contact details, must not be revealed in the submission. The title page may list the authors as "anonymous" and any reference to the prior works of the authors must be in the third person, i.e., references to your own prior work still include full author names. Similarly, if you use your own software, state that a copy of this software was obtained from the authors of the software, preferably with a reference. Omit acknowledgements and funding sources in the submission. The camera-ready submission for an accepted paper can restore these details. (Any further questions about double-blind submissions should be directed to the PC chairs.)  
 Publication Information  
 All accepted submissions will appear in the proceedings published by IEEE. Each accepted paper shall be accompanied by at least one non-student registration.  One of the authors of the paper must attend and present their work at the conference. Failure to present the paper in person can lead to the paper being withdrawn from the proceedings. Please contact either Chipara Octav  , Yehan Ma  , or Luca Abeni  if you have questions regarding the paper submissions.

 Mining Software Repositories 2023  
   
 Welcome to the website of the Mining Software Repositories 2023 conference!  
 The Mining Software Repositories (MSR) conference is the premier conference for data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence in software engineering. The goal of the conference is to improve software engineering practices by uncovering interesting and actionable information about software systems and projects using the vast amounts of software data such as source control systems, defect tracking systems, code review repositories, archived communications between project personnel, question-and-answer sites, CI build servers, and run-time telemetry. Mining this information can help to understand software development and evolution, software users, and runtime behavior; support the maintenance of software systems; improve software design/reuse; empirically validate novel ideas and techniques; support predictions about software development; and exploit this knowledge in planning future development.

 GenAI4PC Symposium Program  Manas Bedmutha    2023-10-09T20:21:38+00:00  UbiComp / ISWC 2023   
  GenAI4PC  Symposium   

 Tulum 4 / October 9, 2023 (10.30 am to 5.30 pm)  

 Generative models – most prominently Large language Models (LLMs) for images and text – have been a major computing advance of 2023. For Ubiquitous Computing, these models offer tantalizing opportunities for personalization, data interpretation and more complex and meaningful interactions with humans.  
 In this new era of AI there are many open problems, including how we assess them and how we deploy them both efficiently and safely. The Generative AI for Pervasive Computing Symposium  (GenAI4PC) aims to bring together both industrial and academic Ubiquitous Computing, researchers to explore these issues in a format that is focused on encouraging discussion and debate.

 UbiComp / ISWC   

 Past Conferences   
 The ACM international joint conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing ( UbiComp  ) is the result of a merger of the two most renowned conferences in the field: Pervasive and UbiComp. While it retains the name of the latter in recognition of the visionary work of Mark Weiser, its long name reflects the dual history of the new event.   
 The ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computing ( ISWC  ) discusses novel results in all aspects of wearable computing, and has been colocated with UbiComp and Pervasive since 2013.   
 A complete list of UbiComp, Pervasive, and ISWC past conferences is provided below.

 Welcome to ITC 2024!   
   
 Dear Colleague,  
 We are holding the conference in beautiful San Diego, CA. We have a fantastic program that addresses new test technology challenges that significantly affect today’s electronic products!  
 ITC is the world’s premier conference dedicated to electronics test. This year’s ITC continues with its mission to play a unique role as an information sharing forum,  where the wide range of its offerings allows ITC participants to learn, network and conduct business. This year’s program includes a top-notch technical program, vibrant exhibitors, information-packed tutorials  , interactive technical panels  , three workshops  , as well as the all-important networking that these events can provide. The technical program has been designed to optimize personal interactions on all levels.  
 AI is everywhere, especially at ITC! Our Tuesday keynote and visionary talks are great examples where industry leaders will discuss AI. We also have an AI track comprising 4 papers sessions where speakers will address machine learning and AI in test. Our supporter presentations also will address test in the age of AI, as will two of our tutorials.  
 This year’s program will include papers from a pool of impressive submissions and solicited papers. Of these submissions, a large number will focus on AI, automotive, memory, and hardware security. In complement to the paper presentations, there will be special sessions on hardware security certification, chiplet integration, silicon lifecycle management, computing in memory, as well as design and test of high-power compound devices and quantum electronics.  
 We are continuing and expanding on the inclusion of the Industrial Practice papers sessions as ITC has a very strong focus on industry practice as well as industry and academia advances.  
 ITC 2024 features a vibrant exhibition  showcasing relevant companies. The exhibition will serve as a convenient one-stop-shop for all the elements of test technology.  
 This year’s live event will enable us to embrace all of the features of the conference such as personal interaction and networking. The ITC Grand Reception will be held Tuesday evening.  
 Last, but not least, I would like to recognize the enormous efforts of the multitude of dedicated volunteers who made ITC possible by donating their time, expertise, and enthusiasm. Without their hard work and dedication, ITC would not be possible. Please feel free to contact us if you would like to join our exciting team in the future.  
 ITC is the premier event for networking, where professionals from all over the world converge to sharpen skills, exchange ideas and do business. Join us, throughout the conference, for networking activities and to unwind.

  Mission  
 Software visualization is a broad research area encompassing concepts, methods, tools, and techniques that assist in a range of software engineering and software development activities. Covered aspects include the development and evaluation of approaches for visually analyzing software and software systems, including their structure, execution behavior, and evolution.  
 The VISSOFT IEEE Working Conference on Software Visualization continues the history of the ACM SOFTVIS Symposium on Software Visualization and the IEEE VISSOFT International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis. The conference focuses on visualization techniques that target aspects of software maintenance and evolution, program comprehension, reverse engineering, and reengineering, i.e., how visualization helps professionals to understand, analyze, test and evolve software. We aim to gather tool developers, experts, users, and researchers from software engineering, information visualization, computer graphics, and human-computer interaction to discuss theoretical foundations, algorithms, techniques, tools, and applications related to software visualization. We seek technical papers, empirical studies, applications, or case studies and provide a platform for presenting novel research ideas and tools.

 Introduction  
   
 AboutComputing and Processing  
  Keywords:source code analysis,source code transformation,  
  Scope:The International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM 2022) aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working on theory, techniques, and applications that concern analysis and/or manipulation of the source code of software systems. The term "source code" refers to any fully executable description of a software system, such as machine code, (very) high-level languages, and executable graphical representations of systems. The term "analysis" refers to any (semi-)automated procedure that yields insight into source code, while "manipulation" refers to any automated or semi-automated procedure that takes and returns source code. While much attention in the wider software engineering community is directed towards other aspects of systems development and evolution, such as specification, design, and requirements engineering, it is the source code that contains the only precise description of the behavior of a system.

  Mission  
 Software visualization is a broad research area encompassing concepts, methods, tools, and techniques that assist in a range of software engineering and software development activities. Covered aspects include the development and evaluation of approaches for visually analyzing software and software systems, including their structure, execution behavior, and evolution.  
 The VISSOFT IEEE Working Conference on Software Visualization continues the history of the ACM SOFTVIS Symposium on Software Visualization and the IEEE VISSOFT International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis. The conference focuses on visualization techniques that target aspects of software maintenance and evolution, program comprehension, reverse engineering, and reengineering, i.e., how visualization helps professionals to understand, analyze, test and evolve software. We aim to gather tool developers, experts, users, and researchers from software engineering, information visualization, computer graphics, and human-computer interaction to discuss theoretical foundations, algorithms, techniques, tools, and applications related to software visualization. We seek technical papers, empirical studies, applications, or case studies and provide a platform for presenting novel research ideas and tools.

  23rd IEEE International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM'2023)  
   
 From: Eduardo Figueiredo <figueiredo@dcc.ufmg.br> Date: Thu, 22 Jun 2023 17:39:48 -0300 Subject: [ECOOP-Info] Last CFP: SCAM 2023 - RENE Track - Paper registration in one week To: ecoop-info@ecoop.org 23rd IEEE International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM) Bogotá, Colombia - October 2-3, 2023 Replication and Negative Results Papers (RENE) Track http://www.ieee-scam.org/2023/#cfprenetrack  === Important Dates === All submission dates are at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12). Abstract submission: June 29th, 2023 Paper submission: July 6th, 2023 Authors notification: August 10th, 2023 Camera Ready: August 24th, 2023 === About === The 23rd IEEE International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM) will be hosting a Replication and Negative Results (RENE) track once again in 2023. Taking advantages of nowadays open science practices, this track provides a venue for researchers to submit papers reporting (1) replications of previous empirical studies (including controlled experiments, case studies, and surveys) and (2) important and relevant negative or null results (i.e., results that failed to show an effect, but help to eliminate useless hypotheses, therefore reorienting researchers on more promising research paths) related to source code analysis and manipulation (see list of topics in Technical Research Track). *Replication studies*: Open science is key to fostering progress via transparency and empirical studies should be reproducible. However, papers in this category must go beyond simply re-implementing an algorithm and/or re-running the artifacts provided by the original paper. Such submissions should apply the approach on at least partially new data sets (open-source or proprietary). This also means that it is possible to use available infrastructures to conduct measurements and experiments but with different/extended datasets and different conditions, scenarios, etc. Replication studies can either strengthen the results of the original study by increasing external validity with additional data or provide new insights into the variables that may impact the results. A replication paper should clearly report on results that the authors were able to reproduce as well as on the aspects of the work that were irreproducible. *Negative result papers*: Due to open source and open science initiatives there are vast amounts of data and software artifacts available in repositories and online archival sites, such as GitHub and Zenodo. Not all analyses of such data and software artifacts result in expected positive results. In this category, we seek papers that report on negative results. We seek negative results for all types of software engineering research related to source code and manipulation (qualitative, quantitative, case study, experiment, etc.). Negative results are important contributions to scientific knowledge because they allow us to prune our hypothesis space. As Walter Tichy writes, "Negative results, if trustworthy, are extremely important for narrowing down the search space. They eliminate useless hypotheses and thus reorient and speed up the search for better approaches." === Open Science Policy === Since we have decided to actively support open science, we expect that replication studies clearly point out the artifacts the study is built upon, and to provide the links to all the artifacts in the submission. However, we recognize that the success of the open science initiative depends on the willingness (and possibilities) of authors to disclose their data and artifacts. Note that all submissions will undergo the same review process independent of whether authors disclose their artifacts or data. For more information about our open science policy, please visit the ICSME 2023 call for papers. === Submission Guidelines === Papers must not exceed 12 pages (the last 2 pages can be used for references only) and must conform to the IEEE proceedings paper format guidelines. Templates in Latex and Word are available on IEEE's website. All submissions must be in English and should be submitted electronically in PDF format via EasyChair. We also follow a double-blind reviewing process. Submissions must be original, in the sense that the findings and writing have not been previously published or under consideration elsewhere. The paper must be clearly marked as a RENE paper. Submissions will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. If the paper is accepted, at least one author must attend the conference and present the paper. === Program Committee === Eduardo Figueiredo (Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil) - track co-chair Quentin Stiévenart (Université du Québec à Montréal, Canada) - track co-chair Alexander Serebrenik (Eindhoven University of Technology) Andrea Stocco (Technical University of Munich) Eduardo Fernandes (University of Southern Denmark) Fabiano Ferrari (Federal University of Sao Carlos) Fiorella Zampetti (University of Sannio) Gias Uddin (University of Calgary) Gilles Perrouin (University of Namur) Jeongju Sohn (University of Luxembourg) Leandro Antonelli (Universidad Nacional de La Plata) Lingfeng Bao (Zhejiang University) Mariano Ceccato (University of Verona) Maurizio Leotta (University of Genova) Naser Jivan (Brock University) Vassilis Zafeiris (Athens University of Economics And Business) Wesley Assunção (North Carolina State University) Xiao Chen (Monash University) Zoltán Porkoláb (Eötvös Loránd University) -- Eduardo Figueiredo Associate Professor and Head of LabSoft Computer Science Department - UFMG https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~figueiredo/  http://labsoft.dcc.ufmg.br/

 From: Quentin Stiévenart <quentin.stievenart@gmail.com> Date: Wed, 3 May 2023 14:53:52 -0400 Subject: [SEWORLD] CFP: 23nd IEEE International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM) To: <seworld@sigsoft.org> ******************************************************************** 23rd IEEE International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM) OCTOBER 2-3, 2023 - BOGOTA, COLOMBIA http://www.ieee-scam.org/2023/#home  ******************************************************************** SCAM aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working on theory, techniques and applications which concern analysis and/or manipulation of the source code of computer systems. For the purpose of clarity "source code" is taken to mean any fully executable description of a software system. It is therefore so-construed as to include machine code very high level languages and executable graphical representations of systems. The term "analysis" is taken to mean any automated or semi automated procedure which takes source code and yields insight into its meaning. The term "manipulation" is taken to mean any automated or semi-automated procedure which takes and returns source code. We are currently accepting submissions for different tracks of the 23rd IEEE International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (IEEE SCAM 2023). Conference proceedings will be published by IEEE CS and made available through the IEEE Digital Library. Call for Research Papers: http://www.ieee-scam.org/2023/#cfpresearchtrack  Call for Engineering Papers: http://www.ieee-scam.org/2023/#cfpengtrack  Call for New Ideas and Emerging Results: http://www.ieee-scam.org/2023/#cfpniertrack  Topics of interest of SCAM include, but are not limited to: - abstract interpretation - bad smell detection - bug location and prediction - clone detection - concern, concept, and feature localization and mining - decompilation - energy efficient source code - natural language analysis of source code artifacts - program comprehension - program slicing - program transformation and refactoring - repository, revision, and change analysis - security vulnerability analysis - source level metrics - source level optimization - source-level testing and verification - static and dynamic analysis Important Dates (All submission dates are at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12).

  FedCSIS2023 - 43th IEEE Software Engineering Workshop (SEW-43)  
   
 Date: Thu, 20 Apr 2023 12:37:41 +0200 To: Marcin Paprzycki <marcin.paprzycki@mans.org.pl> From: Marcin Paprzycki <marcin@amu.edu.pl> Subject: [EMSIG Mailing List] CFP; Joint 43rd IEEE Software Engineering Workshop,and,10th International Workshop on Cyber-Physical Systems (SEW-43 & IWCPS-10); Web of Science Reply-To: <announcements@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr>, [...] CALL FOR PAPERS Joint 43rd IEEE Software Engineering Workshop and 10th International Workshop on Cyber-Physical Systems (SEW-43 & IWCPS-10) Warsaw, Poland, 17-20 September, 2023 https://fedcsis.org/sessions/s3e/sew-iwcps  Organized within FedCSIS 2023 (IEEE: #57573) Strict submission deadline: May 23, 2023, 23:59:59 AOE (no extensions) KEY FACTS: Proceedings: submitted to IEEE Digital Library; indexing: DBLP, Scopus and Web of Science; 70 punktów parametrycznych MEiN Please feel free to forward this announcement to your colleagues and associates who could be interested in it. ********************* Statement concerning LLMs ********************* Recognizing developing issue that affects all academic disciplines, we would like to state that, in principle, papers that include text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM) are prohibited, unless the produced text is used within the experimental part of the work. ********************************************************************* The IEEE Software Engineering Workshop (SEW) is the oldest Software Engineering event in the world, dating back to 1969. The workshop was originally run as the NASA Software Engineering Workshop and focused on software engineering issues relevant to NASA and the space industry. After the 25th edition, it became the NASA/IEEE Software Engineering Workshop and expanded its remit to address many more areas of software engineering with emphasis on practical issues, industrial experience and case studies in addition to traditional technical papers. Since its 31st edition, it has been sponsored by IEEE and has continued to broaden its areas of interest. One such extremely hot new area are Cyber-physical Systems (CPS), which encompass the investigation of approaches related to the development and use of modern software systems interfacing with real world and controlling their surroundings. CPS are physical and engineering systems closely integrated with their typically networked environment. Modern airplanes, automobiles, or medical devices are practically networks of computers. Sensors, robots, and intelligent devices are abundant. Human life depends on them. CPS systems transform how people interact with the physical world just like the Internet transformed how people interact with one another. The joint workshop aims to bring together all those researchers with an interest in software engineering, both with CPS and broader focus. Traditionally, these workshops attract industrial and government practitioners and academics pursuing the advancement of software engineering principles, techniques and practices. This joint edition will also provide a forum for reporting on past experiences, for describing new and emerging results and approaches, and for exchanging ideas on best practice and future directions.
