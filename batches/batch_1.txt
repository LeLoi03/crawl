 The Eleventh AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing  
  November 6–9, 2023  Delft, Netherlands  @hcomp_conf  – #HCOMP2023   

 Welcome to HCOMP 2023!  
 The 11th AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing (HCOMP 2023) will be held November 6-10th at Delft University of Technology as a joint conference with the CI2023-ACM Collective Intelligence Series.  
 HCOMP is the premier venue for disseminating the latest research findings on human computation and crowdsourcing. While artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction (HCI) represent traditional mainstays of the conference, HCOMP believes strongly in fostering and promoting broad, interdisciplinary research. Our field is particularly unique in the diversity of disciplines it draws upon and contributes to including human-centered qualitative studies and HCI design, social computing, artificial intelligence economics, computational social science, digital humanities, policy, and ethics. We promote the exchange of advances in human computation and crowdsourcing not only among researchers but also engineers and practitioners to encourage dialogue across disciplines and communities of practice.  
 HCOMP 2023 builds on a successful history of past meetings  : nine HCOMP conferences (2013–2022) and four earlier workshops, held at the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2011–2012), and the ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (2009–2010).

It is the 10th largest municipality in Belgium and the fourth in Flanders. Leuven is home to the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, the largest and oldest university of the Low Countries and the oldest Catholic university still in existence. The related university hospital of UZ Leuven, is one of the largest hospitals of Europe. The city is also known for being the headquarters of Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer and one of the five largest consumer-goods companies in the world.  
 Leuven's Town Hall is one of the best-known Gothic town halls worldwide and Leuven's pride and joy. It took three architects and thirty years to build it. Leuven's 'Hall of Fame' features 236 statues, which were only added to the façade after 1850. There are 220 men and 16 women in total. On the bottom floor are famous Leuven scientists, artists and historical figures, dressed in Burgundian garb. The first floor is reserved for the patron saints of the various parishes of Leuven. Above them the façade is adorned by the counts and dukes of Brabant while the towers primarily feature biblical figures.  
  
  All ANT 2023 accepted papers will be published by Elsevier Science in the open-access Procedia Computer Science series on-line. Procedia Computer Science is hosted by Elsevier on www.Elsevier.com and on Elsevier content platform ScienceDirect (www.sciencedirect.com), and will be freely available worldwide.

12. ANT_3 conference:
The 15th International Conference on Ambient Systems, Networks and Technologies  
  April 23-25, 2024, Hasselt, Belgium   

  to ANT 2024  
 The 15th International Conference on Ambient Systems, Networks and Technologies (ANT 2024) is a leading international conference for researchers and industry practitioners to share their new ideas, original research results and practical development experiences from all Ambient Systems, Networks and Technologies related areas. ANT 2024 will be held in conjunction with the 7th International Conference on Emerging Data and Industry (EDI40)  .  
 Ambient systems can be viewed as interconnected systems that exist anywhere and everywhere in the environment. These systems are able to work together in the network collaboratively or competitively to provide human users with their daily technological needs, during which these systems remain invisible. This concept has emerged as a major research area with many potential applications. This is because of the multi-disciplinary nature of the themes required such as ubiquitous and pervasive computing, artificial intelligence, networks and communications, data science, Internet of Things, Smart Entities, etc.  
 ANT 2024 will be held in the city of Hasselt. Hasselt was founded in approximately the 7th century on the Helbeek, a small tributary of the Demer  river. The name Hasselt came from Hasaluth  , which means hazel wood. During the Middle Ages, it became one of the bigger towns of the county of Loon  , which had borders approximately the same as the current province of Limburg. Hasselt is an old yet modern city which is home to multiple academic institutions and where visitors can enjoy a variety of activities and entertainment.  
 ANT 2024 is co-organized & co-hosted by the Hasselt University, Belgium  . Since 1973 Hasselt University is located on the Campus Diepenbeek, which occupies an attractive 150 acre site in the middle of Limburg's green belt. It is 2 kms west of the town centre of Diepenbeek, a residential town of 17.717 inhabitants, and 4 kms east of Hasselt which has a population of about 69.529 and is the administrative and commercial centre of the province. Brussels is 90 kms away (to the South-West), Antwerp lies 90 kms to the West, Liege (in the French-speaking part of Belgium) 45 kms to the South, Maastricht (in the Netherlands) 25 kms to the East, Aachen (in Germany) 60 kms to the South-East.  
   
 All ANT 2024 accepted papers will be published by Elsevier Science in the open-access Procedia Computer Science series on-line. Procedia Computer Science is hosted by Elsevier on www.Elsevier.com and on Elsevier content platform ScienceDirect (www.sciencedirect.com), and will be freely available worldwide. All papers in Procedia will be indexed by Scopus (www.scopus.com) and by Thomson Reuters' Conference Proceeding Citation Index (http://thomsonreuters.com/conference-proceedings-citation-index/). All papers in Procedia will also be indexed by Scopus (www.scopus.com) and Engineering Village (Ei) (www.engineeringvillage.com). This includes EI Compendex (www.ei.org/compendex). Moreover, all accepted papers will be indexed in DBLP (http://dblp.uni-trier.de/). The papers will contain linked references, XML versions and citable DOI numbers. You will be able to provide a hyperlink to all delegates and direct your conference website visitors to your proceedings.

 Visit to the C-mine expedition :  (located in the nearby city of Genk)  
 C-mine expedition starts in the energy building of the C-mine site. First you descend to 6 meter deep where you get to see a lot of surprising installations. Famous artists such as Stijn Meuris and Pascale Platel made unique stories about the mine in combination with creative image projections. In the interactive sound cell you are going to get busy. Produce your own 'sound ' by levers, buttons and wheels to operate. Or sample the atmosphere while you're wondering around in the maze on the way to the topsoil.The highlight of the expedition is to climb the giant and authentic mine tower on the square. That is more than 60 meters high! Perhaps you reach the top exhausted, but the reward is greater: gorgeous views of the green surroundings of Limburg. For the slightly less ' big ' daredevil, there is a stop at 15 metres height. If you don't like heights, stay comfortable with both feet firmly on the ground. Just enjoy the open feeling on the beautifully renovated square.

 Papers  
  
 TL;DR for Seasoned Authors  
 Authors must submit abstracts by January 20 and full papers by January 27. When submitting abstracts, authors must supply their Semantic Scholar and DBLP ids. 
  Papers submitted to EC’23 must select one of four methodological tracks and several content areas. The list of tracks and content areas can be found below. 
  EC’23 is continuing the forward-to-journal option as in previous years. 
  EC’23 is currently planned as a primarily in-person event. 
   
 Background  
 Since 1999, the ACM Special Interest Group on Economics and Computation (SIGecom) has sponsored the leading scientific conference on advances in theory, empirics, and applications at the interface of economics and computation. The 24th ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (EC’23) will feature invited speakers, a highlight of papers from other conferences and journals, a technical program of submitted paper presentations, as well as posters, workshops, and tutorials. EC’23 is currently planned as a primarily in-person event, taking place from July 9 through July 12, 2023 at King’s College London in London. %Some components (e.g., poster sessions and tutorials) may be held either virtually or in a hybrid format. Presenters of accepted papers who cannot (or do not feel comfortable to) travel will have the option to present their paper virtually during preview week (and must explicitly request permission).  
 We solicit paper submissions for presentation in the technical program.

 Submission Instructions  
 Submit a Paper   
 Identifiers.  Authors must submit abstracts by January 20 and full papers by January 27. When submitting abstracts, authors must supply their Semantic Scholar and DBLP ids.  
 Format.  The body of the submission (excluding the title page and the bibliography) may be up to 18 pages long. The title page should only contain the title, submission number, and the abstract. In addition, an appendix of arbitrary length may be included at the end of the paper only for the review process (i.e., an appendix will not appear if the paper is published). This appendix will be read at the discretion of the reviewers. To add the submission number to the title page, one must first submit a paper without a number, see what number was assigned, and then revise the submission to include this number. The body of the submission should contain a clear presentation of the contributions of the paper, including a discussion of prior work and an outline of the key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. The submission as a whole should include all of the ideas necessary for an expert to fully verify the central claims in the paper. Submitted papers will be evaluated on significance of the contribution, originality, relation to prior research, technical quality, and exposition.  
 LaTex style files.  Authors are required to format their submissions using the EC’23 LaTex style files  (updated: Jan 4, 2023), which uses a single-column format with 10-point font. Papers that do not use the EC’23 LaTex style files or violate the page limit will be rejected without review.  
 Tracks.  Each submission must select one of four tracks that differ along methodological dimensions. The reviewing process of each track will be overseen by the corresponding Track Chair(s), who are primarily responsible for ensuring that consistent reviewing standards are applied to all papers in the same track. Authors should consider the description of the tracks to evaluate which track best captures the research community according to whose standards their paper should be reviewed. The list of conferences/journals is only a sample meant to indicate the research community and typical methodological approach, but authors from any research community are welcome to submit to any of the tracks. EC’23 will use the following four tracks:  
 Theory: | Typical papers in this track make progress on existing theoretical problems, propose new ones, or introduce significant new techniques that could be applied more broadly. These papers are often similar in methodology to papers that are published in FOCS, STOC, SODA, ICALP, JACM, Econometrica, JET, TE, or Math of OR. | Track chairs | : Shuchi Chawla (University of Texas), Brendan Lucier (Microsoft Research), and Philipp Strack (Yale University). 
  Applied Modeling: | Typical papers in this track propose and analyze novel models that capture real-world phenomena or provide fresh perspectives on previously studied applied problems. These papers are often similar in methodology to papers that are published in Operations Research, Management Science, RAND Journal of Economics, or MSOM. | Track chairs: | Daniela Saban (Stanford University) and Alex Teytelboym (University of Oxford). 
  Empirics: | Typical papers in this track draw significant insights from real or synthetic data, through access to new data sources or experiments, or through novel analysis of existing data sources. These papers are often similar in methodology to papers that are published in the Journal of Marketing Research, Management Science, Marketing Science, Organization Science, Strategic Management Journal, Experimental Economics, Quantitative Marketing and Economics, Review of Economics and Statistics, or MSOM. | Track chair: | Denis Nekipelov (University of Virginia) 
  AI: | Typical papers in this track study the design or analysis of intelligent agents or intelligent systems, broadly construed. These papers are often similar in methodology to papers that are published in AAAI, IJCAI, NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, UAI, TARK, AAMAS, AIJ, JAIR, JMLR, or MLJ. | Track chair: | Felix Brandt (Technical University of Munich) 
  Areas.  Each submission must select several content areas from the list provided below. Note that the areas are partially overlapping; if in doubt, authors are advised to select those area(s) that best fit their paper. Content areas will be used to match papers with a member of the Area Chair who is assigned to at least one of the paper’s areas. Area Chairs are responsible for shepherding papers through the review process and for making accept/reject recommendations to the Program Chairs.

  STOC submissions.  Authors who have had submissions to STOC 2023 rejected may submit (potentially revised) versions of those papers to EC 2023, including in the submission the STOC reviews and author response, by Wednesday, February 22. (Abstracts need not be registered in advance.) These papers should be submitted using the submission link above.  
 Review process.  Each paper will be reviewed in detail by at least two referees.  
 There will be two stages of review, with some decisions announced on March 3 after first-round reviews, and the remaining decisions announced on May 1 after a second round of reviews. Between March 28-31, authors of papers undergoing second-round reviewing will be able to submit responses to the reviews, which will be taken into account by the review team.  
 The review process is double blind. Authors must take measures to ensure that their identity is not easily revealed from the submission itself. Authors should refer to their prior work in a neutral manner (i.e., instead of saying “We showed” say “XYZ et al. showed”).  
 Submission of code and data.  In the interest of reproducibility, authors of papers that include empirical results are strongly encouraged to submit their code and data. Such material should be archived as a single zip file and submitted as supplementary material.  
 One-page extended abstract option.  To accommodate the publishing traditions of different fields, authors of accepted papers can ask that only a one-page abstract of the paper appear in the proceedings, along with a URL pointing to the full paper. Authors should guarantee the link to be reliable for at least two years. This option is available to accommodate subsequent publication in journals that would not consider results that have been published in preliminary form in conference proceedings. Such papers must be submitted electronically and formatted just like papers submitted for full-text publication.  
 Submission of publicly available work (e.g., papers on arXiv).  It is acceptable to submit work that has been presented in public (provided there are no published proceedings) or has been uploaded to arXiv or similar online archives, provided the submission itself is anonymized.  
 Simultaneous submissions to journals.  As in prior years, it is acceptable to simultaneously submit papers to EC’23 and to a journal, or to submit papers that are already under review at a journal, including papers that have already received a “revise and resubmit”, as long as the paper has not been accepted for publication prior to the EC submission deadline, and provided that the authors intend to publish the paper as a one-page abstract in EC. Papers that are accepted at EC’23 and appear as a one-page abstract can subsequently be submitted for publication in a journal but may not be submitted to any other archival conference (i.e., with published proceedings).  
 No other simultaneous submissions.  The following submissions are not allowed: (a) papers that are currently under review at another archival conference, (b) papers that have been accepted for publication in a journal or archival conference before the EC’23 submission deadline, (c) papers containing results that have previously been published in a journal or archival conference.  
 Highlights beyond EC.  Papers that have already been published (or have been accepted for publication) in conferences or journals other than EC can be nominated (including self-nominations) for inclusion in a special plenary session at EC’23 called “Highlights beyond EC”, which is intended to highlight some of the best work in economics and computation that has appeared elsewhere. The corresponding call for nominations will be announced soon.  
 Forward to journal:  Authors of accepted papers will have the option to select the forward-to-journal option to have the reviews forwarded to a journal of their choice. Our partner journals are:  
 ACM Transactions on Economics and Computatio | n 
  Econometrica 
  Games and Economic Behavior 
  International Economic Review 
  International Journal of Game Theory 
  Journal of Economic Theory 
  Management Science | , Revenue Management and Market Analytics area 
  Management Science | , Behavioral Economics and Decision Analysis area 
  Marketing Science 
  Mathematics of Operations Research | , Game Theory area 
  Operations Research | , Revenue Management and Market Analytics area 
  Quantitative Marketing and Economics 
  Review of Economic Studies 
  Social Choice and Welfare 
  Theoretical Economics 
  TheoretiCS 
  When submitting the camera-ready version of their papers, authors of accepted papers can (optionally) choose the forward-to-journal option and specify at most one journal. Those authors may then submit a journal version of their paper to the chosen journal, with a deadline of August 15, 2023. The cover letter to the journal should specify that the submission is part of the EC’23 forward-to-journal process. For each paper that has chosen the forward-to-journal option, the EC’23 reviews will be forwarded (along with reviewer identities) to the chosen journal on August 15, 2023.  
 For consideration in Games and Economic Behavior, Econometrica, Journal of Economic Theory, Management Science, Marketing Science, Quantitative Marketing and Economics, RAND Journal of Economics, Review of Economic Studies, Social Choice and Welfare, or Theoretical Economics, authors of accepted papers must select the one-page extended abstract option for the proceedings version, explained above. For consideration in the International Journal of Game Theory, the full paper can be published in the EC proceedings, although the introduction and structure of the journal version will typically be different from the EC version. Other journals may require additional content beyond the EC proceedings version; it is the responsibility of authors to ensure that the version submitted to a journal conforms with any journal-specific expectations regarding the prior proceedings version. A journal’s participation in the EC forward-to-journal option does not mean that other forms of prior publication are acceptable.  
 We emphasize that the ultimate disposition of the paper is within the editorial discretion of each journal; in particular, there is no guarantee of acceptance if the forward-to-journal option is chosen. However, we do anticipate that this process should result in a faster decision from the journal.  
 Feature at INFORMS.  Authors of accepted papers can indicate if they wish to be considered for presenting their papers in special sessions at the 2023 INFORMS Annual Meeting, organized and sponsored by the INFORMS Auctions and Market Design (AMD) Section. To be considered for this fast-track selection process conducted by the AMD cluster chairs, authors will need to provide a short non-technical abstract (at most 500 characters) and indicate whether the intended presenter is an INFORMS job market candidate. The exact deadline to submit this information will be announced soon.  
 Conflict of interest.  Authors will have the opportunity to declare conflicts of interest (COIs) with Track Chairs, Senior Program Committee members, or others. This must be done separately for each submission. Declaring COIs prevents the specified people from reviewing a paper, thereby constraining the matching process and so potentially negatively impacting review quality. For this reason, COIs should not be declared automatically based on a prior relationship. Instead, when declaring COIs, Authors are asked to follow the ACM Conflict of Interest Policy  . Track Chairs and Senior Program Committee members can also declare a conflict of interest with authors as well as with specific papers.  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy  will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

 Last Update : [2 September, 2023]  

 The 30th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) seeks submissions presenting novel contributions related to all real-world aspects of computer security and privacy. Theoretical papers must make a convincing case for the relevance of their results to practice. Authors are encouraged to write the abstract and introduction of their paper in a way that makes the results accessible and compelling to a general computer-security researcher. In particular, authors should bear in mind that anyone on the program committee may be asked to review any paper.  

 CCS has 2 Review Cycles   
 In 2023.   
    
 For each submission,  
  one of the following decisions will be made:  
    
 Accept  
   
 Papers in this category will be accepted for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference possibly after making minor changes with the oversight of a shepherd.  

 Minor Revision  
   
 Papers in this category are considered to be promising but need some minor additional work (e.g., minor experiments, proofs to minor lemmas). Authors will be given the opportunity to resubmit such papers, with appropriate revisions, in which case they should clearly explain in a well-marked appendix how the revisions address the comments of the reviewers. The revised paper will then be re-evaluated, and either accepted or rejected.  

 Reject  
   
 Papers in this category are declined for inclusion in the conference. Papers rejected from the first review cycle may not be submitted again (even in revised form) to the second review cycle.  

 Authors of each accepted paper must ensure that at least one author registers for the conference, and that their paper is presented in-person at the conference if at all possible.

 Paper Submission  
 Information  
    
 Quick Overview:  
    
 11:59 PM AoE / (UTC-12)   
   
 Submission must be received by 11:59 PM AoE (UTC-12) on the day of the corresponding deadline.   

 No Double Submission  
   
 Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or accepted for publication or that are simultaneously in submission to a journal, conference, or workshop with published proceedings.  

 Must be anonymized  
   
 All submission should be properly anonymized; papers not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.  

 All submissions must be received by 11:59 PM AoE (UTC-12) on the day of the corresponding deadline. Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or accepted for publication, or that are simultaneously in submission to a journal, conference, or workshop with published proceedings. All submissions should be properly anonymized; papers not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.  
 All submitted papers will be evaluated based on their merits, particularly their importance to practical aspects of computer and communications security and privacy, novelty, quality of execution, and presentation. For papers that might raise ethical concerns, authors are expected to convince reviewers that proper procedures (such as IRB approval or responsible disclosure) have been followed, and due diligence has been made to minimize potential harm.  
 Submitted papers may be rejected for being out of scope, at the discretion of the PC chairs. Authors who have questions about whether their paper is in scope are encouraged to ask the PC chairs in advance.  

 Paper Format  
    
 Quick Overview:  
    
 PDF File Format  
   
 Submission must be converted or readied in PDF File Format. Please contact your IT service provider if you have any difficulties on preparing your submission(s).  

 Double-Column ACM format (Sigconf style)   
   
 Please refer ACM Proceedings Template  for more information.  

 12 Pages Maximum   
   
 Bibliography, Well-marked Appendices, and Supplementary Material are excluded.  

 Submissions must be a PDF file in double-column ACM format  (see ACM Proceedings Template  , using the sigconf style  ), no more than 12 pages long  , excluding the bibliography, well-marked appendices, and supplementary material. Note that reviewers are not required to read the appendices or any supplementary material. Authors should not change the font or the margins of the ACM format. Submissions not following the required format may be rejected without review.  

 Providing Artifacts at Submission Time  
 Submissions whose claimed contributions rely on artifacts (e.g., code, models, data sets) are expected to make these accessible to the reviewers, unless there are good reasons not to, in which case these reasons must be mentioned in the submission.  
 Submissions whose claimed contributions do not rely on artifacts do not need to submit artifacts.  

 Optional Artifact Evaluation (New!)   
 A published scientific paper consists of a constellation of artifacts that extend beyond the document itself: software, hardware, evaluation data and documentation, raw survey results, mechanized proofs, models, test suites, benchmarks, and so on. To emphasize the importance of such artifacts, the benefits to the authors and the community as a whole, and promote the reproducibility of experimental results, ACM CCS will, for the first time, introduce an optional artifact evaluation (AE) process, inspired by similar efforts at several other conferences. All authors of accepted papers (including shepherd approved and minor revisions) are encouraged to submit artifacts for AE.  
 Each artifact submitted will be reviewed by the Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC); a special call for artifacts will follow in early January.

 ACM CCS 2023 features a multi-track format. Each track operates as a separate mini-conference, with its own Track Program Chair and Track Program Committee. The overall process is managed by the Conference Co-Chairs (Cas Cremers and Engin Kirda).  
 At the time of submission, authors must select one track, which should be the most relevant to the topic of the paper. We understand that some papers might span multiple topics. In specific cases, PC members might be asked to provide reviews for papers outside their track, in an effort to provide the best possible reviews to the authors. The chairs may decide to move a paper to another track.  

 Conflicts of Interest  
 The conference requires cooperation from both authors and program-committee members to ensure a fair review process. For this purpose, authors must report all program-committee members who, in their opinion, have a conflict of interest and therefore may not be able to provide an unbiased review.  
 Mandatory declared conflicts of interest include current or former doctoral advisor/advisee, members of the same institution, close family members, and recent co-authors (within the past 2 years). For any other declared conflict, authors are required to explain the nature of the conflict, which will be reviewed by the Conference Co-Chairs and the Track Chairs. The chairs reserve the right to request further explanation and can remove non-mandatory conflicts at their discretion.  
 Track Chairs are allowed to submit papers, and those papers will be handled by the Conference Co-Chairs. They are only allowed to submit two papers in their own track, and any number in other tracks.  
 Program-committee members who have a genuine conflict of interest with a paper, including the Conference Co-Chairs and the Track Chairs, will be excluded from evaluation and discussion of that paper. When a Track Chair has a conflict, the paper will be handled by the Conference Co-Chairs. When a Conference Co-Chair is conflicted, the other Co-Chair will be responsible for managing that paper. When both Conference Co-Chairs are in conflict, a committee member will be appointed to handle the paper. Conference Co-Chairs are not allowed to be authors or co-authors of any submissions.  

 Policy for Peer-Review Integrity  
 All SIGSAC sponsored conferences and workshops are required to follow ACM policies against harassment activities  and ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.  Also all authors, PC members and non-PC reviewers are required to follow ACM Publications Policies.   
 Particularly, we require all reviewers to uphold the integrity of the peer review process and avoid conflict of interest of any form (e.g., reviewer collusion ring). Those who violate these policies will be penalized according to ACM policies  . If you would like to report a violation, please contact program chairs of your conferences/workshops or SIGSAC officers. We are committed to protecting the confidentiality of your communication.  

 Diversity and Inclusion  
 ACM CCS is committed to promoting diversity and inclusion in our community. If you have suggestions, concerns, or complaints related to biases or sexual harassment, we encourage you to reach out to the Conference Co-Chairs. We are committed to protecting the anonymity of such reports and helping to address your concerns. We value your feedback and ideas to help us all build a healthier and more welcoming community.  
 We encourage the authors to be mindful of not using language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing. Of course, exclusionary treatment can arise unintentionally. Be vigilant and actively guard against such issues in your writing. Reviewers will also be empowered to monitor and demand changes if such issues arise in your submissions. Please check the link   for more information.

 The 11th AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing (HCOMP 2023) was held November 6-10th at Delft University of Technology as a joint conference with the CI2023-ACM Collective Intelligence Series.  
 HCOMP serves as an invaluable platform and believes in fostering and promoting broad, interdisciplinary research in human computation and crowdsourcing. Though artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction (HCI) have been conventional cornerstones of the conference, HCOMP draws upon and contributes to various fields including human-centered qualitative studies and HCI design, social computing, artificial intelligence, economics, computational social science, digital humanities, policy, and ethics. It unites a diverse community of researchers, engineers, and practitioners, encouraging collaborative progress and innovation in this evolving discipline.

 SUBMITTING A PAPER  

 CSCW is the premier international venue for research in the design and use of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and networks. We invite authors to submit their best research on all topics relevant to collaborative or social computing. Accepted papers are published in two annual CSCW issues of the journal series Proceedings of the ACM on Human Computer Interaction (PACM HCI).  
 CSCW 2023 will follow the half-yearly submission model implemented in CSCW 2022. Thus, new paper submissions will be only possible for the July 2022 and January 2023 deadlines.  
 We have two additional deadlines in October and April for revisions only. Below an overview of the submission timeline.  
     
 Important Dates  
 July 2022 Cycle  
 July 15, 2022: New paper submissions due 23:59 Anywhere on Earth (AoE) time. 
  October 15, 2022: | Resubmission of papers that received a Minor Revision recommendation due 23:59 AoE. 
  Important: Failing to resubmit the revised version of a Minor Revision paper of the July 2023 Cycle in this deadline means that the paper must be resubmitted as a new submission to a future cycle and will be assigned to new ACs and reviewers. 
  January 15, 2023: | Earliest resubmission of papers that received a Major Revision recommendation due 23:59 AoE. 
  Earliest resubmission of papers that received a Reject recommendation as new submissions. 
  April 15, 2023: | Latest resubmission of papers that received a Major Revision recommendation due 23:59 AoE. 
  Important: Failing to resubmit the revised version of a Major Revision paper of the July 2023 Cycle in this deadline means that the paper must be resubmitted as a new submission to a future cycle and will be assigned to new ACs and reviewers. 
  Accepted papers are invited to present at CSCW 2023. 
  January 2023 Cycle  
 January 15, 2023: | New paper submissions due 23:59 AoE. 
  Accepted papers are invited to present at CSCW 2023. 
  April 15, 2023: | Earliest resubmission of papers that received a Minor Revision recommendation due 23:59 AoE.

  Accepted papers are invited to present at CSCW 2023. 
  July 15, 2023: | Earliest resubmission of papers that received a Major Revision recommendation due 23:59 AoE. 
  Earliest resubmission of papers that received a Reject recommendation as new submissions. 
  Important: Failing to resubmit the revised version of a Minor Revision paper of the January 2023 Cycle in this deadline means that the paper must be resubmitted as a new submission to a future cycle and will be assigned to new ACs and reviewers. 
  Accepted papers are invited to present at CSCW 2024. 
  October 15, 2023: | Latest resubmission of paper that received a Major Revision recommendation due 23:59 AoE. 
  Important: Failing to resubmit the revised version of a Major Revision paper of the January 2023 Cycle in this deadline means that the paper must be resubmitted as a new submission to a future cycle. 
  Accepted papers are invited to present at CSCW 2024. 
  Paper reviews will be sent to authors roughly 11 weeks from the initial submission and major revision resubmission. Review turnaround for final checks and papers accepted with minor revisions will be shorter. For the CSCW July 2022 submission deadline, we hope to send out notifications on September 30th, 2022.  
 The submission site will open 2 weeks before each deadline. No deadline extensions will be granted.  
 Call for Papers  
 We invite authors to submit papers that inform the design or deployment of collaborative or social systems; introduce novel systems, interaction techniques, or algorithms; or study existing collaborative or social practices. The scope of CSCW 2023 includes social computing and social media, crowdsourcing, open and remote collaboration, technologically enabled or enhanced communication, such as video-conferencing and other remote-presence technologies, CSCL, MOOCs and related educational technologies, multi-user input technologies, collocated work practices, work articulation and coordination, awareness, and information sharing. This scope spans socio-technical domains of work, home, education, healthcare, the arts, sociality, entertainment, and ethics. Papers can report on novel research results, designs, systems, or new ways of thinking about, studying, or supporting shared activities.  
 CSCW encourages papers that contribute to building CSCW systems, including (but not limited to) engineering and technical enablers for CSCW applications, methods, and techniques for new CSCW services and applications, and evaluation of both early-stage and fully built CSCW systems in lab or field settings.  
 To support diverse and high-quality contributions, CSCW uses a two-cycle review process with opportunity for major revisions reviewed by the same reviewers. Additionally, no arbitrary length limit is imposed on submissions. Accepted papers are published in the Proceedings of the ACM: Human Computer Interaction (PACM HCI) journal.  
 We invite contributions to CSCW across a variety of research techniques, methods, approaches, and domains, including:  
 Social and crowd computing. Studies, theories, designs, mechanisms, systems, and/or infrastructures addressing social media, social networking, wikis, blogs, online gaming, crowdsourcing, collective intelligence, virtual worlds, or collaborative information behaviors. 
  System development. Hardware, architectures, infrastructures, interaction design, technical foundations, algorithms, and/or toolkits that enable the building of new social and collaborative systems and experiences. 
  Theory. Critical analysis or theory with clear relevance to the design or study of social and collaborative systems, within and beyond work settings. 
  Empirical investigations. Findings, guidelines, and/or studies of practices, communication, collaboration, or use, as related to collaborative technologies. 
  Data mining and modeling. Studies, analyses, and infrastructures for making use of large- and small-scale data. 
  Methodologies and tools. Novel methods, or combinations of approaches and tools used in building collaborative systems or studying their use. 
  Domain-specific social and collaborative applications. Including applications to healthcare, transportation, gaming, ICT4D, sustainability, education, accessibility, global collaboration, or other domains. 
  Collaboration systems based on emerging technologies. Mobile and ubiquitous computing, game engines, virtual worlds, multi-touch, novel display technologies, vision and gesture recognition, big data, MOOCs, crowd labor markets, SNSs, or sensing systems. 
  Ethics and policy implications. Analysis of the implications of socio-technical systems and the algorithms that shape them. 
  Crossing boundaries. Studies, prototypes, or other investigations that explore interactions across disciplines, distance, languages, generations, and cultures, to help better understand how to transcend social, temporal, and/or spatial boundaries. 
  Send queries about paper submissions to papers2023@cscw.acm.org  .  
 Submission Process Details  
 CSCW 2023 is using the Precision Conference System (PCS) 2.0: https://new.precisionconference.com  . Authors submitting papers for peer-review to ACM publications must comply with the SIGCHI Submission and Review Policy including, but not limited to:  
 That the paper submitted is original, that the listed authors are the creators of the work, that each author is aware of the submission and that they are listed as an author, and that the paper is an honest representation of the underlying work. 
  That the work submitted is not currently under review at any other publication venue, and that it will not be submitted to another venue unless it has been rejected or withdrawn from this venue. 
  For information about re-publication in English of work previously published in another language, please refer to section 1.5.4 of the ACM SIGCHI policy.  
 Parallel submissions: Authors submitting multiple papers related to the same study are required to provide information about the relationship among them, as well as how they are different from one another. Authors should use the “Comments (optional)” field on the Submission form to provide this information.  
 Confidentiality of submitted material will be maintained. Upon acceptance, the titles, authorship, and abstracts of papers will be used in the Advance Program. Submissions should contain no information or material that is or will be proprietary and/or confidential at the time of publication and should cite no publication that will be proprietary or confidential at that time. Final versions of accepted papers must be formatted according to detailed instructions provided by the publisher. Copyright release forms must be signed for inclusion in the PACM HCI and the ACM Digital Library.  
 Formatting and Length  
 Word authors: Because CSCW papers are published in PACM HCI that uses the Sheridan service, authors need to use the old interim ACM Small template, which is no longer published on ACM websites. Please use the following link to access the templates: https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates   
 LaTeX authors need to use the template which is available at https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions  , and insert the acmsmall call.  
 Overleaf authors need to use the template at https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-journals-new-master-template/vgtfrcvmrvxf  , and use the acmsmall call.  
 Note: In preparing revisions, authors should continue using the template they had used for their original submissions.  
 No minimum or maximum length is imposed on papers. Rather, reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length. Typical papers are under 10,000 words.  
 Note: Valuable but concise contributions are welcome as short papers. Shorter, more focused papers will be reviewed with the expectation of a small, focused contribution. Papers whose length is incommensurate with their contribution will be rejected.  
 Anonymous Review Policy  
 Papers are subject to anonymous reviewing. Submissions must have authors’ names and affiliations removed and avoid obvious identifying statements. Any grant information that identifies the author(s) and their institution should be removed as well. Papers that violate this policy will be desk rejected. Please check in particular the front page, headers and footers, Acknowledgement section, AND meta-data of the submitted file.  
 Citations to authors’ own relevant work should NOT be anonymous, but rather should be done without identifying the authors. For example, “Prior work by [authors]” instead of “In our prior work.”  
 CSCW does not have a policy against uploading preprints to SSRN or arXiv before they are submitted for review at the conference.  
 Nevertheless, to ensure the integrity of the peer review process, we ask that no authors publicize the work until that process is complete. Please do not share any confidential info specific to a current review process publicly* or on social media. (*Exception: Doing public exhibitions, festivals, and performances as part of the research where the name is integral to the work).  
 We also ask the reviewers to refrain from taking steps to learn about the author’s identity during the peer review process.  
 Decisions and Deadlines  
 CSCW will be returning submissions to the primary contact author with one of the following decisions, along with the reviews, roughly 11 weeks from the initial submission. For the CSCW July 2022 submission deadline, we hope to send out notifications on September 30th, 2022. Review turnaround for accepted papers and final checks will be shorter:  
 Accept: | Submissions that receive this decision are ready or nearly ready for publication, though they may require a few small changes. The final version of the paper must be submitted in the next deadline (or earlier) for verification by the corresponding associate chair. The submission will appear in an upcoming issue of the PACM HCI. 
  Minor revision: | Submissions that receive this decision will require some revisions before being accepted for publication. The revised submission MUST be submitted within the next deadline, along with a brief response to the reviewers’ comments. The revision will be verified by the corresponding associate chair and if approved, the submission will be promoted to an accepted paper. 
  Major revision: | Submissions that receive this decision have real potential, but will require major portions rewritten or redone, and then re-reviewed. Given the amount of effort that should be invested in a major revision, the earliest resubmission of a revised major revision is after two deadlines of the initial submission. Latest submission will also be acceptable three deadlines after the initial submission. For example, a July 2022 submission receiving a Major Revision decision can be first resubmitted to the January 2023 deadline and must be resubmitted by the April 2023 deadline at the latest. The authors must ensure that the paper has been revised sufficiently to warrant re-review. To the extent possible, resubmissions will be assigned the same AC and reviewers for re-review. Upon re-review, submissions can receive one of two decisions: Accept with minor revisions or Reject. Unlike most journals, the current CSCW review process does NOT allow for more than one major revision recommendation due to reviewer availability and time constraints. 
  Reject: | Authors of rejected papers are allowed to resubmit their papers in the next cycle as a new submission after receiving the Reject decision. For example, if the paper was rejected after a submission in July 2022, authors can re-submit the paper as a new submission in the following January 2023 cycle. However, papers resubmitted with no or marginal changes will be desk rejected without review. Authors must describe the paper’s submission history and briefly outline the changes in a designated field in PCS when resubmitting. Failure to disclose the paper’s submission history may lead to a desk reject decision. ACs and reviewers will have access to this description of the paper’s submission history and may also request to review the detailed submission history. 
  Desk / Quick Reject: | Authors should only submit completed work of publishable quality and within the scope of ACM CSCW. The ACs and Editors may Quick Reject any submission that they believe has little chance of being accepted if it goes through the peer review process. Incomplete or otherwise inappropriate submissions will be desk rejected without review. 
  CSCW Decision Appeal Process  
 We recognize that authors may sometimes feel a review is unfair, inappropriate, or problematic in other ways. CSCW has implemented the following process for authors who wish to appeal a decision:  
 Either: | Authors directly contact the Papers Chairs to officially appeal a decision 
  A committee member (1 AC / 2AC / Editor / Papers Chair) raises an issue about the decision or decision-making process, possibly in response to a communication from an author 
  The appeal involves motivating the case with evidence 
  Papers Chairs assess the situation and make an initial call to bring it up for discussion with the Editors 
  The Editor assigned to the submission reviews the paper, the reviews, and the discussion in PCS to determine if the case is valid. The Editor may choose to involve the ACs at this stage 
  Other Editors weigh in and review the case 
  The Editors come to a collective decision and share their decision with the Papers Chairs 
  The Papers Chairs discuss the Editors’ decision. If a change is agreed, Papers Chairs record the updated decision in PCS 
  The Papers Chairs communicate the final decision to the authors 
  If the authors are dissatisfied with the outcome of this process, the case will then be referred to the CSCW Steering Committee 
  Primary Research Paradigm Selection for Reviewing  
 When uploading the paper to the PCS reviewing system, authors will be able to indicate the primary research paradigm of their paper for appropriate reviewer assignment:  
 Technical/Systems, e.g., building novel systems, algorithms, implementing novel features in existing systems, etc. 
  Empirical-Qualitative, e.g., ethnography, workplace studies, qualitative user studies, etc. 
  Empirical-Quantitative, e.g., “big data,” quantitative user studies, statistical methods, etc. 
  Mixed Methods, e.g., combined qualitative and quantitative empirical research, design explorations combined with technical feature development. 
  Design, e.g., design implications, guidelines, methods, techniques, etc. 
  Theoretical, e.g., conceptual frameworks, theory underpinning CSCW studies/domains, theoretical analysis, and essays. 
  Open and Transparent Science  
 Authors are encouraged to submit supplementary material when possible and when aligned with their methods. Authors are encouraged to submit links to pre-registrations on the Open Science Framework (OSF) when appropriate for their work. Authors are also encouraged to use open access repositories and make their data and other material FAIR when appropriate for their work. Authors are encouraged to describe efforts to make their work more reproducible. Reviewers are encouraged to support evolving approaches to supporting open and transparent research practices.  
 Video Figures  
 Authors should consider submitting a video that illustrates their work as part of the submission (no more than three minutes long). Videos are not required for paper submissions, but are strongly encouraged, particularly for papers contributing novel systems or interaction techniques.  
 Presenting at the Conference  
 Accepted papers are invited to present at the corresponding conference for that deadline, and authors can choose whether or not they wish to present. Because the situation may be changing and times are uncertain, authors are encouraged to discuss alternative options with the Papers Chairs. Presenting at the conference is strongly recommended but not required.

 TL;DR for Seasoned Authors  
 Authors must submit abstracts by January 20 and full papers by January 27. When submitting abstracts, authors must supply their Semantic Scholar and DBLP ids. 
  Papers submitted to EC’23 must select one of four methodological tracks and several content areas. The list of tracks and content areas can be found below. 
  EC’23 is continuing the forward-to-journal option as in previous years. 
  EC’23 is currently planned as a primarily in-person event. 
   
 Background  
 Since 1999, the ACM Special Interest Group on Economics and Computation (SIGecom) has sponsored the leading scientific conference on advances in theory, empirics, and applications at the interface of economics and computation. The 24th ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (EC’23) will feature invited speakers, a highlight of papers from other conferences and journals, a technical program of submitted paper presentations, as well as posters, workshops, and tutorials. EC’23 is currently planned as a primarily in-person event, taking place from July 9 through July 12, 2023 at King’s College London in London. %Some components (e.g., poster sessions and tutorials) may be held either virtually or in a hybrid format. Presenters of accepted papers who cannot (or do not feel comfortable to) travel will have the option to present their paper virtually during preview week (and must explicitly request permission).

 Submission Instructions  
 Submit a Paper   
 Identifiers.  Authors must submit abstracts by January 20 and full papers by January 27. When submitting abstracts, authors must supply their Semantic Scholar and DBLP ids.  
 Format.  The body of the submission (excluding the title page and the bibliography) may be up to 18 pages long. The title page should only contain the title, submission number, and the abstract. In addition, an appendix of arbitrary length may be included at the end of the paper only for the review process (i.e., an appendix will not appear if the paper is published). This appendix will be read at the discretion of the reviewers. To add the submission number to the title page, one must first submit a paper without a number, see what number was assigned, and then revise the submission to include this number. The body of the submission should contain a clear presentation of the contributions of the paper, including a discussion of prior work and an outline of the key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. The submission as a whole should include all of the ideas necessary for an expert to fully verify the central claims in the paper. Submitted papers will be evaluated on significance of the contribution, originality, relation to prior research, technical quality, and exposition.  
 LaTex style files.  Authors are required to format their submissions using the EC’23 LaTex style files  (updated: Jan 4, 2023), which uses a single-column format with 10-point font. Papers that do not use the EC’23 LaTex style files or violate the page limit will be rejected without review.  
 Tracks.  Each submission must select one of four tracks that differ along methodological dimensions. The reviewing process of each track will be overseen by the corresponding Track Chair(s), who are primarily responsible for ensuring that consistent reviewing standards are applied to all papers in the same track. Authors should consider the description of the tracks to evaluate which track best captures the research community according to whose standards their paper should be reviewed. The list of conferences/journals is only a sample meant to indicate the research community and typical methodological approach, but authors from any research community are welcome to submit to any of the tracks. EC’23 will use the following four tracks:  
 Theory: | Typical papers in this track make progress on existing theoretical problems, propose new ones, or introduce significant new techniques that could be applied more broadly. These papers are often similar in methodology to papers that are published in FOCS, STOC, SODA, ICALP, JACM, Econometrica, JET, TE, or Math of OR. | Track chairs | : Shuchi Chawla (University of Texas), Brendan Lucier (Microsoft Research), and Philipp Strack (Yale University). 
  Applied Modeling: | Typical papers in this track propose and analyze novel models that capture real-world phenomena or provide fresh perspectives on previously studied applied problems. These papers are often similar in methodology to papers that are published in Operations Research, Management Science, RAND Journal of Economics, or MSOM. | Track chairs: | Daniela Saban (Stanford University) and Alex Teytelboym (University of Oxford). 
  Empirics: | Typical papers in this track draw significant insights from real or synthetic data, through access to new data sources or experiments, or through novel analysis of existing data sources. These papers are often similar in methodology to papers that are published in the Journal of Marketing Research, Management Science, Marketing Science, Organization Science, Strategic Management Journal, Experimental Economics, Quantitative Marketing and Economics, Review of Economics and Statistics, or MSOM. | Track chair: | Denis Nekipelov (University of Virginia) 
  AI: | Typical papers in this track study the design or analysis of intelligent agents or intelligent systems, broadly construed. These papers are often similar in methodology to papers that are published in AAAI, IJCAI, NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, UAI, TARK, AAMAS, AIJ, JAIR, JMLR, or MLJ. | Track chair: | Felix Brandt (Technical University of Munich) 
  Areas.  Each submission must select several content areas from the list provided below. Note that the areas are partially overlapping; if in doubt, authors are advised to select those area(s) that best fit their paper. Content areas will be used to match papers with a member of the Area Chair who is assigned to at least one of the paper’s areas. Area Chairs are responsible for shepherding papers through the review process and for making accept/reject recommendations to the Program Chairs.  
 Auctions and pricing 
  Behavioral economics and bounded rationality 
  Blockchain and cryptocurrencies 
  Contract design 
  Crowdsourcing and information elicitation 
  Data sharing 
  Decision theory 
  Econometrics, ML, and data science 
  Economics of algorithms 
  Equilibria, learning, and dynamics in games 
  Equilibrium computation and complexity 
  Fair division 
  Information design 
  Market design & matching markets 
  Market equilibria 
  Mechanism design 
  Online algorithms, learning, and decision making

  STOC submissions.  Authors who have had submissions to STOC 2023 rejected may submit (potentially revised) versions of those papers to EC 2023, including in the submission the STOC reviews and author response, by Wednesday, February 22. (Abstracts need not be registered in advance.) These papers should be submitted using the submission link above.  
 Review process.  Each paper will be reviewed in detail by at least two referees.  
 There will be two stages of review, with some decisions announced on March 3 after first-round reviews, and the remaining decisions announced on May 1 after a second round of reviews. Between March 28-31, authors of papers undergoing second-round reviewing will be able to submit responses to the reviews, which will be taken into account by the review team.  
 The review process is double blind. Authors must take measures to ensure that their identity is not easily revealed from the submission itself. Authors should refer to their prior work in a neutral manner (i.e., instead of saying “We showed” say “XYZ et al. showed”).  
 Submission of code and data.  In the interest of reproducibility, authors of papers that include empirical results are strongly encouraged to submit their code and data. Such material should be archived as a single zip file and submitted as supplementary material.  
 One-page extended abstract option.  To accommodate the publishing traditions of different fields, authors of accepted papers can ask that only a one-page abstract of the paper appear in the proceedings, along with a URL pointing to the full paper. Authors should guarantee the link to be reliable for at least two years. This option is available to accommodate subsequent publication in journals that would not consider results that have been published in preliminary form in conference proceedings. Such papers must be submitted electronically and formatted just like papers submitted for full-text publication.  
 Submission of publicly available work (e.g., papers on arXiv).  It is acceptable to submit work that has been presented in public (provided there are no published proceedings) or has been uploaded to arXiv or similar online archives, provided the submission itself is anonymized.  
 Simultaneous submissions to journals.  As in prior years, it is acceptable to simultaneously submit papers to EC’23 and to a journal, or to submit papers that are already under review at a journal, including papers that have already received a “revise and resubmit”, as long as the paper has not been accepted for publication prior to the EC submission deadline, and provided that the authors intend to publish the paper as a one-page abstract in EC. Papers that are accepted at EC’23 and appear as a one-page abstract can subsequently be submitted for publication in a journal but may not be submitted to any other archival conference (i.e., with published proceedings).  
 No other simultaneous submissions.  The following submissions are not allowed: (a) papers that are currently under review at another archival conference, (b) papers that have been accepted for publication in a journal or archival conference before the EC’23 submission deadline, (c) papers containing results that have previously been published in a journal or archival conference.  
 Highlights beyond EC.  Papers that have already been published (or have been accepted for publication) in conferences or journals other than EC can be nominated (including self-nominations) for inclusion in a special plenary session at EC’23 called “Highlights beyond EC”, which is intended to highlight some of the best work in economics and computation that has appeared elsewhere. The corresponding call for nominations will be announced soon.  
 Forward to journal:  Authors of accepted papers will have the option to select the forward-to-journal option to have the reviews forwarded to a journal of their choice. Our partner journals are:  
 ACM Transactions on Economics and Computatio | n 
  Econometrica 
  Games and Economic Behavior 
  International Economic Review 
  International Journal of Game Theory 
  Journal of Economic Theory 
  Management Science | , Revenue Management and Market Analytics area 
  Management Science | , Behavioral Economics and Decision Analysis area 
  Marketing Science 
  Mathematics of Operations Research | , Game Theory area 
  Operations Research | , Revenue Management and Market Analytics area 
  Quantitative Marketing and Economics 
  Review of Economic Studies 
  Social Choice and Welfare 
  Theoretical Economics 
  TheoretiCS 
  When submitting the camera-ready version of their papers, authors of accepted papers can (optionally) choose the forward-to-journal option and specify at most one journal. Those authors may then submit a journal version of their paper to the chosen journal, with a deadline of August 15, 2023. The cover letter to the journal should specify that the submission is part of the EC’23 forward-to-journal process. For each paper that has chosen the forward-to-journal option, the EC’23 reviews will be forwarded (along with reviewer identities) to the chosen journal on August 15, 2023.  
 For consideration in Games and Economic Behavior, Econometrica, Journal of Economic Theory, Management Science, Marketing Science, Quantitative Marketing and Economics, RAND Journal of Economics, Review of Economic Studies, Social Choice and Welfare, or Theoretical Economics, authors of accepted papers must select the one-page extended abstract option for the proceedings version, explained above. For consideration in the International Journal of Game Theory, the full paper can be published in the EC proceedings, although the introduction and structure of the journal version will typically be different from the EC version. Other journals may require additional content beyond the EC proceedings version; it is the responsibility of authors to ensure that the version submitted to a journal conforms with any journal-specific expectations regarding the prior proceedings version. A journal’s participation in the EC forward-to-journal option does not mean that other forms of prior publication are acceptable.  
 We emphasize that the ultimate disposition of the paper is within the editorial discretion of each journal; in particular, there is no guarantee of acceptance if the forward-to-journal option is chosen. However, we do anticipate that this process should result in a faster decision from the journal.  
 Feature at INFORMS.  Authors of accepted papers can indicate if they wish to be considered for presenting their papers in special sessions at the 2023 INFORMS Annual Meeting, organized and sponsored by the INFORMS Auctions and Market Design (AMD) Section. To be considered for this fast-track selection process conducted by the AMD cluster chairs, authors will need to provide a short non-technical abstract (at most 500 characters) and indicate whether the intended presenter is an INFORMS job market candidate. The exact deadline to submit this information will be announced soon.  
 Conflict of interest.  Authors will have the opportunity to declare conflicts of interest (COIs) with Track Chairs, Senior Program Committee members, or others. This must be done separately for each submission. Declaring COIs prevents the specified people from reviewing a paper, thereby constraining the matching process and so potentially negatively impacting review quality. For this reason, COIs should not be declared automatically based on a prior relationship. Instead, when declaring COIs, Authors are asked to follow the ACM Conflict of Interest Policy  . Track Chairs and Senior Program Committee members can also declare a conflict of interest with authors as well as with specific papers.  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy  will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

 WORKSHOPS  

 Saturday, Oct 14, 2023  
 1. Back to “Back to Labor”: Revisiting Political Economies of Computer-Supported Cooperative Work  (Room: Boundary Waters B)  
 Organizers:  Joice Tang, University of Washington; McKane Andrus, University of Washington; Samuel So, University of Washington; Udayan Tandon, University of California San Diego; Andrés Monroy-Hernández, Princeton University; Vera Khovanskaya, University of California San Diego; Sean A. Munson, University of Washington; Mark Zachry, University of Washington; Sucheta Ghoshal, University of Washington  
 Format:  In-person  
 Website:  https://sites.google.com/uw.edu/b2b2labor-workshop/home   
 Description:  Almost thirty years ago, CSCW published an article written by Joan Greenbaum detailing how and why CSCW should consider the framing of “labor” over “work” in researching and designing information systems. This argument is especially salient in the present day, with the increasing wariness of algorithmically-mediated monitoring, surveillance, automation, and management in work processes. Despite its salience, Greenbaum’s paper has had relatively low engagement in CSCW so far. As such, this workshop responds to Greenbaum’s call-to-action, asking: 1) Where is CSCW research now in thinking about “work” vs. “labor” in designing systems? and 2) How can we support emerging CSCW scholars in grounding themselves in theories of work that includes (if not centers) a labor-oriented economic frame? This workshop will aim to generate a critical consciousness around labor issues in CSCW. Ultimately, by crafting individual commitments to labor, this workshop will aim to contribute to a more worker-centered future.  
 How to apply:  We invite participation from CSCW scholars with research interests in the future of work and labor, including but not limited to topics such as workplace technologies, platform-mediated labor, and technical workplace dynamics. We particularly welcome 1) early-career graduate students and their collaborators and 2) senior scholars wanting to broaden or bridge conversations in CSCW about work and labor.  
 Prospective participants must fill out this form  , which asks for a ~500-word reflection on their personal and academic orientations to work and/vs. labor, as well as their current or aspirational connections to labor-related research. Prospective participants also have an option to submit a short workshop paper if they would like to share and discuss works in progress in the virtual grounding event. Submissions are due EOD on August 31, 2023 (AOE).  
 2. Conceptualizing Indigeneity in Social Computing  (Room: Great Lakes A2)  
 Organizers:  Dipto Das, University of Colorado Boulder; Parboti Roy, University of British Columbia; Carlos Toxtli, Clemson University; Kagonya Awori Awori, Microsoft Africa Research Institute; Morgan Vigil-Hayes, Northern Arizona University; Monojit Choudhury, Microsoft Research Lab India; Neha Kumar, Georgia Tech; Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed, University of Toronto, ; Bryan Semaan, University of Colorado Boulder  
 Format:  Hybrid  
 Website:  https://sites.google.com/view/indigeneity-social-computing/   
 Description:  There has been little effort in conceptualizing indigeneity in social computing, despite the concept being central to decolonial and postcolonial perspectives, which scholars have increasingly used in computing research for over a decade. It is crucial to reflect on who can be considered indigenous in the spirit of inclusion and reclamation since the underdevelopment of this concept and the nuances, differences, relationships, and overlaps between indigeneity and colonial marginalization may silence different populations in research. The workshop aims to bring together scholars whose works are associated with different local and indigenous cultures and their technology practices and experiences to initiate conversations around three themes: (a)~defining indigeneity and identifying indigenous communities in social computing, (b)~recognition in different sociopolitical contexts, and (c)~contributions to social computing.  
 How to apply:  Participants will reflect and create a collective vision of how conceptualizing indigeneity can be a critical lens for understanding the power, values, and cultural factors entangled with technology. We invite researchers and practitioners to submit position papers under the following themes:  
 Indigeneity in Social Computing: | When referring to decolonial and postcolonial computing research, what does the term Indigenous mean? 
  Recognition in Sociopolitical Contexts: | What are the similarities and differences between the communities studied in those projects and the indigenous people recognized in their respective sociocultural and geopolitical contexts? 
  Contributions to Social Computing: | What are the implications of conceptualizing indigenousness for critical computing? 
  3. Understanding and Mitigating Cognitive Biases in Human-AI Collaboration  (Room: Great Lakes A3)  
 Organizers:  Nattapat Boonprakong, University of Melbourne; Gaole He, Delft University of Technology; Ujwal Gadiraju, Delft University of Technology; Niels van Berkel, Aalborg University; Danding Wang, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Si Chen, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign; Jiqun Liu, University of Oklahoma; Benjamin Tag, Monash University; Jorge Goncalves, University of Melbourne; Tilman Dingler, University of Melbourne  
 Format:  Hybrid  
 Website:  http://www.critical-media.org/cscw23/   
 Description:  AI systems are increasingly incorporated into human decision-making. Yet, human decision-makers are often affected by their cognitive biases. In critical settings, such as medical diagnosis, criminal judgment, or information consumption, these cognitive biases hinder optimal decision outcomes, thereby resulting in dangerous decisions and negative societal impact. The use of AI systems can amplify and exacerbate cognitive biases in their users. In this workshop, we seek to foster discussions on ongoing research around cognitive biases in human-AI collaboration and identify future research directions to understand, quantify, and mitigate the effects of cognitive biases. We will explore cognitive biases appearing in various contexts of human-AI collaboration: what can cause them?; how can we measure, model, mitigate, and manage cognitive biases?; and how can we utilize cognitive biases for the greater good? We will reflect on workshop discussions to form a research community around cognitive biases and bias-aware systems.  
 We invite participants to this workshop to submit their contributions including:  
 a short research summary or position paper (2-4 pages excluding references) discussing one or more workshop themes 
  an essay (one page) stating motivations for attending this workshop with a short bio 
  Each submission will be reviewed by the workshop organi  z  ers  and accepted based on the quality of the submission and the diversity of perspectives. Accepted submissions will be encouraged to record a short 3-5 minutes video presenting the content of their submission, which will be available to watch before the workshop.  
 All submissions should be sent as PDF via this form  . There is no specific template for submissions; however, we recommend using the ACM single-column templ  a  te  . Please correspond any question to cscw.cobi@gmail.com  .  
 4. Many Worlds of Ethics: Ethical Pluralism in CSCW  (Room: Lake Harriet)  
 Organizers:  Mohammad Rashidujjaman Rifat, University of Toronto; Ayesha Bhimdiwala, University of Texas at Austin; Ananya Bhattacharjee, University of Toronto; Amna Batool, University of Michigan; Dipto Das, University of Colorado Boulder; Nusrat Jahan Mim, Harvard University; Abdullah Hasan Safir, University of Warwick; Sharifa Sultana, Cornell University; Taslima Akter, University of California Irvine; C. Estelle Smith, Colorado School of Mines; Bryan Semaan, University of Colorado Boulder; Shaimaa Lazem, New Borg El-Arab; Robert Soden, University of Toronto; Michael Muller, IBM Research; Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed, University of Toronto  
 Format:  Hybrid  
 Website:  https://sites.google.com/view/pluralismcscw/   
 Description:  Although CSCW has shown a strong interest in diversity and inclusion, the literature predominantly reflects ethics rooted in Western universalism, modernism, scientism, and Euro-centrism. Consequently, CSCW theories and practices tend to marginalize millions of people worldwide whose ethical perspectives do not align with the narrow focus of ethics and values within CSCW. In an effort to embrace ethical pluralism within CSCW, we propose a day-long hybrid workshop in CSCW and invite researchers and practitioners to initiate conversations centered around three themes: (a) foregrounding ethical diversities, (b) adapting diverse ethics, and (c) addressing challenges, barriers, and limitations associated with incorporating plural ethics into CSCW. Through this workshop, we aim to bring together CSCW scholars and practitioners, fostering a community that advocates for and advances the cause of pluralism in socio-technical systems.  
 How to apply:  Despite a strong interest in diversity and inclusion, the CSCW community has marginally engaged with pluralism. In our day-long hybrid workshop, we will explore the opportunities and challenges of recognizing and adapting diverse ethics in CSCW theories and practices. We invite interested researchers and practitioners to submit a position paper under the following themes:  
 Foregrounding ethical diversities: | Identifying the systems of ethics that are marginalized in CSCW research, theories, and practices and underlining the importance of elevating those in CSCW. 
  Adaptation of diverse ethics: | Reflect on and propose ways in which future work in the CSCW community can adapt and accommodate for coexistence of diverse ethical paradigms. 
  Challenges, barriers, and limits of adapting plural ethics in CSCW: | What might be some pressing challenges of adopting pluralism in CSCW. What might be some negative consequences of adopting pluralism in sociotechnical systems? 
  Please send your paper to pluralismatcscw@gmail.com  with the subject line “CSCW 2023 Workshop”.  
 5. Trauma-Informed Design: A Collaborative Approach to Building Safer Online Spaces  (Room: Boundary Waters D)  
 Organizers:  Casey Randazzo, Rutgers University; Carol F. Scott, University of Michigan; Rosanna Bellini, Cornell Tech; Tawfiq Ammari, Rutgers University; Michael Ann DeVito, University of Colorado Boulder; Bryan Semaan, University of Colorado Boulder; Nazanin Andalibi, University of Michigan School of Information  
 Format:  Hybrid  
 Website:  https://sites.google.com/view/traumainformedcscw   
 Description:  Trauma-informed design, which is gaining greater attention in the Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Human-Computer Interaction (CHI) communities, focuses on designing and managing online platforms with consideration for the prevalence and impact of trauma on individuals, communities, and wider societies. This approach aims to build safer and more supportive digital spaces for users who have a history or trauma. This workshop enables participants to critically examine the application and measurement of trauma-informed approaches to social media. We bring together researchers and practitioners to explore the challenges and opportunities of trauma-informed design, with the goal of creating more compassionate and ethical online spaces that prioritizes user safety, well-being, and healing. Participants will engage in activities that encourage collaboration, discussion, and reflection on the principles of trauma-informed design and their application in different online contexts. By the end of the workshop, participants will have a better understanding of the principles of trauma-informed design and be equipped with tools and strategies to apply these principles in their work.  
 6. Centering refugees, migrants, and asylum seekers experiences in digitalization and datafication   
 Organizers:  Firaz Ahmed Peer, University of Kentucky; Reem Talhouk, Northumbria University; Vasilis Vlachokyriakos, Newcastle University; Trine Rask Nielsen, University of Copenhagen; Naja Holten Møller, University of Copenhagen; Kristin Kaltenhäuser, University of Copenhagen  
 Format:  Hybrid  
 Website:  https://migrationanddatafication.github.io/workshop/   
 Description:  Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and related fields of research are advocating for comprehensive investigations into the role of data and data-driven technologies to ensure responsible and appropriate usage within the context of migration, particularly for refugees and asylum seekers – a domain, set to be fundamentally reformed by data-driven technologies. The growing production of new types of data about refugees and asylum seekers presents authorities with novel opportunities to incorporate such data in their decision-making processes. Similarly, the ways through which refugees and asylum seekers are seeking information about healthcare, education, housing, peer support and other services is increasingly being done in online and digital spaces. As such, this workshop aims to center the experience of refugee and asylum seeking experiences across migration related information systems in order to unpack the ways through which digitalization and datafication impacts/transforms their daily lives and vice versa.  
 How to apply:  We invite anyone interested in participating to submit a two to four-page position paper (or equivalent material such as e.g. zines) that addresses the workshop themes (see below). We encourage you to discuss your interest in the themes, welcoming reports of (preliminary) empirical results, theoretically oriented pieces, as well as methodological reflections. We also welcome submissions reflecting on questions related to datafication, digitization, and migration that we have not listed in our themes. Submissions will be reviewed by the organizers and accepted based on the relevance and development of their chosen topic, as well as participants’ potential to contribute to the workshop. We will have two submission deadlines, to allow for early bird registration to the CSCW conference.  
 If you have any questions, please reach out to Firaz Peer (firazpeer@uky.edu).  
 Please use the link to the Google form on the workshop website to submit your paper.  
 7. Emerging Telepresence Technologies for Hybrid Meetings: an Interactive Workshop  (Room: Boundary Waters A)  
 Organizers:  Andriana Boudouraki, University of Nottingham; Houda El Mimouni, Indiana University Bloomington; Marta Orduna, Nokia Spain; Pablo Pérez, Nokia Spain; Ester González-Sosa,Nokia Spain; Pablo Cesar, The National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands; Jesús Gutiérrez, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid; Taffeta Wood, UC Davis; Veronica Ahumada-Newhart, University of California Davis; Joel Fischer, University of Nottingham  
 Format:  Hybrid  
 Website:  https://cscw23emergingtelepresence.wordpress.com   
 Description:  We are rapidly moving to a hybrid world, where telepresence technologies play a crucial role. But, are current technologies ready for such a shift? Do they provide adequate support for interaction and collaboration? In this workshop, together with the participants, we will try out a variety of telepresence technologies for hybrid meetings. Based on small hybrid group activities we will explore how different systems compare in terms of immersion, interaction, and usability. Additionally, we will reflect on the social implications of telepresence. The aim of the workshop is to bring together the lived experiences of both remote and local participants, with activities that stimulate reflections on our experiences. These reflections will fuel group discussions, to identify future research areas in telepresence and hybrid meeting technologies. Results from the workshop will be published as a white paper with recommendations for the design of future telepresence and hybrid meeting technologies.  
 How to apply:  This workshop is intended for HCI researchers and designers who are interested in studying or developing telepresence technologies for hybrid meetings and collaboration. Workshop applicants can make one of two types of submissions; 1) a position paper, 2) a system contribution. Please submit your paper via email to telepresence4hybridmeetings@gmail.com.

 8. Historicism in/as CSCW Method: Research, Sensibilities, and Design  (Room: Great Lakes A2)  
 Organizers:  Robert Soden, University of Toronto; David Ribes, University of Washington; Seyram Avle, University of Massachusetts Amherst; Sarah E Fox, Carnegie Mellon University; Phoebe Sengers, Cornell University; Shreyasha Paudel, University of Toronto; Megh Marathe, Michigan State University  
 Format:  In-person  
 Website:  https://cscwhistory.wordpress.com/   
 Description:  This workshop furthers the growing adoption of historicism in HCI and CSCW. Inspired by mounting attention to history in the field, we aim to convene a broad range of scholars to advance the discussion around what a specifically historicist sensibility might look like for this research community, and how such a sensibility may be reflected in issues around research methods, evaluation, and training. In so doing, we will continue to trouble boundaries, disciplinary and otherwise, that demarcate what is considered to be history and whose histories are considered, as part of the broader turn to historicism that is underway. This one-day workshop will be in person and participant driven, with a stronger methodological focus than those that have come before. In addition to working groups focused on topics that emerge through workshop papers and initial discussions, we will develop practical next steps for creating a stronger enabling environment for historical approaches in HCI and CSCW research.  
 How to apply:  To apply, please send a brief position paper to cscwhistory@gmail.com  by August 21st 2023  . Position papers should be in the ACM Extended Abstract format and address one or more of the following:  
 Describe an ongoing research project that draws on history to make contributions to CSCW and/or HCI. 
  What does an historicist approach/sensibility look like in your work? 
  What challenges do you face in incorporating history in your research?

 9. A Toolbox of Feminist Wonder: Theories and methods that can make a difference  (Room: Boundary Waters B)  
 Website:  https://blogg.sh.se/a-toolbox-of-feminist-wonder/   
 Description:  This one-day hybrid workshop builds on previous feminist CSCW workshops to explore feminist theoretical and methodological approaches that have provided us with useful tools to see things differently and make space for change. Since its inception over a decade ago, feminist HCI has progressed from the margins to mainstream HCI, with numerous references in the literature. Feminist HCI has also evolved to incorporate other critical HCI practices such as Queer HCI, participatory design, and speculative design. While feminist approaches have grown in popularity and become mainstream, it is getting more difficult to distinguish the feminist emancipatory core from other attempts of developing and improving society in various ways. In this workshop, we therefore want to revisit our feminist roots, where theory is a liberatory and creative practice, motivatedby affect, curiosity, and wonder. We will engage in speculative, playful and collaborative making. From this standpoint, we consider which of our feminist tools can make a significant difference today, in a highly datafied world. The goal of this workshop is to; 1) create an inventory of feminist theories and concepts that have had an impact on our work as designers, educators, researchers, and activists; 2) develop a feminist toolbox for the CSCW community to strengthen our feminist literacy.  
 How to apply:  To participate, submit a 2-4 pages position paper where you suggest one or more feminist theories and methods that have been useful in your previous research. Describe the theory/method and explain how you have used them. As this is a hybrid workshop, notify if you intend to participate online or offline.

 10. Data-Enabled Sustainability: The Collective Work of Turning Data into Actions for Environmental Care  (Room: Boundary Waters A)  
 Organizers:  Chiara Rossitto, Stockholm University; Martin V. A. Lindrup, Aalborg University; Rob Comber, KTH Royal Institute of Technology; Jakob Tholander, Stockholm University; Mattias Jacobsson, Södertörn University; Alex Cabral, Harvard University; Rikke Hagensby Jensen, Aalborg University  
 Format:  Hybrid  
 Website:  https://sustws.medieteknik.info   
 Description:  An increasing range of technologies – from sensor-based IoT devices to digital platforms and AI-enabled systems – allows local institutions, collectives, or single individuals to generate and analyze environmental data. This one-day workshop invites discussions on the role of data and data-enabled practices in addressing challenges of environmental sustainability. Fostering acts of care for the environment is a complex endeavor entailing multi-lifespan relations to people and institutions, to the environment and other non-human actors, and to existing infrastructures and processes. The workshop addresses such challenges by exploring the role of data, and the work needed to make them meaningful and actionable for the many actors involved in protecting the environment. It will bring together interdisciplinary scholars, representatives of public institutions, activists, environmental collectives, and IT practitioners interested in the design of more sustainable futures. The workshop will discuss analytical and design issues of data-enabled sustainability, along with the practical opportunities and challenges of using data to infrastructure acts of care for the environment. The workshop will accommodate up to twenty participants and will be mainly run on-site.  
 How to apply:  We welcome researchers, practitioners, designers, and other actors who find this call relevant to their work and/or life practices. This one-day workshop will include short presentations and outdoor explorations of urban data practices for which sustainability is key. It will entail group and plenary discussions on how data can become valuable resources for actions aiming at environmental care.  
 We encourage participants to submit a 2-4 page position paper (references excluded) in the ACM single-column format, either by using the Word or Latex template.  
 11. Supporting User Engagement in Testing, Auditing, and Contesting AI  (Room: Boundary Waters C)  
 Organizers:  Wesley Hanwen Deng, Carnegie Mellon University; Michelle S. Lam, Stanford University, Ángel Alexander Cabrera, Carnegie Mellon University; Danaë Metaxa, University of Pennsylvania; Motahhare Eslami, Carnegie Mellon University; Kenneth Holstein, Carnegie Mellon University  
 Format:  In-person  
 Website:  https://cscw-user-ai-auditing.github.io   
 Description:  In recent years, there has been a growing interest in involving end users directly in testing, auditing, and contesting AI systems. The involvement of end users from diverse backgrounds can be essential to overcome AI developers’ blind spots and to surface issues that would otherwise go undetected prior to causing real-world harm. Emerging bodies of work in CSCW have begun to explore ways to engage end-users in testing and auditing AI systems, and to empower users to contest erroneous AI outputs. However, we know little about how to support effective user engagement.  
 In this one-day workshop, we will bring together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and non-profit organizations to share ongoing efforts related to this workshop’s theme. Central to our discussions will be the challenges encountered in developing tools and processes to support user involvement, strategies to incentivize involvement, the asymmetric power dynamic between AI developers and end users, and the role of regulation in enhancing the accountability of AI developers and ameliorating potential burdens towards end-users. Overall, we hope the workshop outcome could orient the future of user engagement in building more responsible AI.  
 How to apply:  We welcome participants who work on related areas in supporting user engagement in testing, auditing, and contesting AI. We will publicize the workshop through mailing lists, social media, and organizations that work on engaging users in AI testing, auditing, and contesting. Interested participants will be asked to contribute a brief statement of interest to the workshop. Submissions can take several forms:  
 Position paper (3-5 pages) | discussing or contributing to one or more themes highlighted in this proposal. 
  Video or audio demo of an interactive system (3-5 minutes) | that is relevant to user-engagement in AI testing, auditing, and contesting. 
  Case study | discussing ongoing work in engaging end users in AI testing, auditing, and contesting. 
  “Encore” submissions | of highly-relevant conference/journal papers. 
  12. Surfacing Structural Barriers to Community-Collaborative Approaches in Human-Computer Interaction  (Room: Great Lakes A1)  
 Organizers:  Calvin Liang, University of Washington; Emily Tseng, Cornell Tech; Akeiylah DeWitt, University of Washington, Yasmine Kotturi, Carnegie Mellon University; Sucheta Ghoshal, University of Washington; Angela D. R. Smith, University of Texas at Austin; Marisol Wong-Villacres, Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral; Lauren Wilcox, Google;Sheena Erete, University of Maryland College Park  
 Format:  Hybrid  
 Website:  https://sites.google.com/view/cca-at-cscw/home   
 Description:  Community-collaborative approaches to technology research promise a more just, equitable, and societally impactful future for computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW). But how can we ensure that CSCW builds knowledge with communities as meaningful partners, rather than conducting research activities on them? And what would it take for our research activities to go a step further, with the aim of helping communities work towards alternative social structures and counter harmful structural oppression? With growing interest in community-collaborative approaches (CCA) in CSCW among both academic and industry institutions, it is time to reflect upon the field’s history of these forms of engagement to develop pathways for the future. This interactive workshop draws from an expert roundtable featuring CSCW and human-computer interaction (HCI) researchers with a collectively rich wealth of knowledge on enacting, critiquing, and navigating community-based research. Together, we explore the structural challenges of CCA for communities, research institutions, and individual researchers, with an explicit focus on how the values of computing research do and do not align with what is needed for truly community-collaborative work.  
   
 How to apply:  We invite computing researchers interested and invested in community-collaborative approaches to computing research. We welcome researchers with any experience or interest level in CCA work and aim to include a balance of expertise levels in the workshop.  
 Interested participants should fill out a form that asks for applicants to reflect on their goals for this workshop experience and 1-2 high-level questions they would like to explore more deeply. https://forms.gle/c6abHvf6m2MY6NP47   
 13. Supporting Workers in Developing Effective Collaboration Skills for Complex Work  (Room: Boundary Waters D)  
 Organizers:  Evey Huang, Northwestern University; Kapil Garg, Northwestern University; Diego Gómez-Zará, University of Notre Dame; Julie Hui, University of Michigan; Chinmay Kulkarni, Emory University; Michael Massimi, Slack; Elizabeth F Churchill, Google LLC; Elizabeth Gerber, Northwestern University  
 Format:  In-person  
 Website:  https://learning-collaboration-cscw23-workshop.vercel.app   
 Description:  This one–day, in-person workshop aims to support participants in reflecting, ideating, and prototyping new socio-technical approaches to help workers develop effective collaboration skills for complex work. While CSCW researchers have created tools to provide workers access to collaboration opportunities, workers require more support in learning to collaborate effectively to benefit from these opportunities. This workshop invites academic and industry researchers who study these topics and develop socio-technical systems for workplaces to participate. Participants will share insights from their work and work with each other to envision an agenda for future research and design of workplaces that support learning how to collaborate. Discussion and ideas generated from this workshop will be synthesized and archived online for the larger research community and the general public. We hope these discussions will foster new collaborations and further develop a community of researchers interested in supporting learning in the future of work.  
 How to apply:  Interested participants should submit a short paper describing original research and articulation of a contributor’s interest and experience in workshop topics. Interested participants should describe either: Their research, preliminary or completed, related to the topics of this workshop; or a position paper arguing for a particular idea or approach related to the topics of the workshop.  
 Paper should use ACM Extended Abstracts Format and be 3-5 pages long (excluding references). Submissions will be reviewed by the organizers based on both relevance and originality. Please submit papers to eveyhuang@u.northwestern.edu  by August 25th, 2023 (AOE)  .  
 14. Epistemic injustice in online communities: Unpacking the values of knowledge creation and curation within CSCW applications  (Room: Lake Harriet)  
 Organizers:  Leah Ajmani, University of Minnesota; Mo Houtti, University of Minnesota; Jasmine C Foriest, Georgia Institute of Technology; Michael Ann DeVito, Northeastern University; Nicholas Vincent, UC Davis; Isaac Johnson, Wikimedia Foundation  
 Format:  Hybrid  
 Website:  https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/epistemic-injustice-cscw2023/home   
 Description:  Information flows are pervasive on the internet and often have a low entry barrier. From an epistemological perspective, information evolves into knowledge. For example, information about mental health on TikTok can act as actionable knowledge for someone seeking to improve their mental health. However, social computing has long known that people do not interact with knowledge cleanly, especially in digital environments. While knowledge curation is essential for targeting irrelevant, biased, or even harmful information, it is value-laden; in choosing how to present information, we undermine non-traditional information such as personal experiences. In this hybrid workshop, we will bring together researchers from academia, industry, and marginalized communities to discuss how current CSCW applications contribute to the systemic silencing, exclusion, or delegitimization of certain knowledge contributions (i.e., epistemic injustice). We will diagram our own mental models of how knowledge is created and curated and reflect on critical questions to orient the design of inclusive knowledge spaces online, particularly with topics that blend personal experience with factual information, such as mental health.  
 How to apply:  We invite individuals interested in presenting their work to submit a 2-4 page extended abstract. Accepted abstracts will be guaranteed a presentation slot. For individuals interested in attending without presenting, we will later have an application form (capped at 40 people) on our website so stay tuned!

 15. Environmental and Climate Justice in Computing   
 Date:  Sat, October 14, 2023  
 Organizers:  Olivia Doggett, University of Toronto; Jen Liu, MIT; Ufuoma Ovienmhada, Cornell University; Samar Sabie, University of Toronto; Sarah Gram, University of Toronto; Matt Ratto, University of Toronto; Laura J Perovich, Northeastern University; Robert Soden, University of Toronto  
 Format:  Online only  
 Website:  https://sites.google.com/view/climatejusticecscw/home   
 Description:  While climate change has been a longstanding concern of HCI and CSCW communities, this scholarship has rarely drawn attention to the well-documented pattern of minoritized and marginalized communities unfairly carrying the brunt of environmental burdens. Through this one-day remote workshop, we plan to critically extend how CSCW can support climate action by focusing on two social movements, environmental and climate justice, both of which aim to reduce environmental degradation and pursue sustainable communities without doing so at the expense of others. Through this workshop, we aim to gather a community of researchers, activists, and practitioners conducting or interested in pursuing work related to environmental or climate justice. Through our activities, we aim to identify how CSCW and datafication has helped to uphold environmental or climate justice commitments or has been complicit in producing or maintaining environmental harms. We also plan to discuss and identify a CSCW research agenda addressing how to support environmental and climate justice principles and processes in designing technologies and systems. We hope that this workshop will help to initiate and foster a longer-term relationship with researchers, activists and practitioners engaging with these topics.  
 How to apply:  Our workshop discussion is anchored in a central question: as individual researchers, practitioners, and activists, in what ways does our work, and the research-related institutions we operate within, work against and toward environmental and climate justice movements? To respond to this question, we invite contributions on the following themes:  
 Datafication Imaginaries: | Reflections or analysis on the ways data and technology are designed, structured, implemented and disseminated to work toward or against environmental or climate justice outcomes; 
  Visibility and beyond: | Analysis on the role and relevance of visibility as intervention, as well as the potential for CSCW to support more radical interventions (e.g., land back, prison abolition) as an approach to environmental and climate justice outcomes; 
  Towards Critical Environmental Justice: | Identification of communities (including more than humans) and types of social difference that have been marginalized by traditional notions of sustainability in CSCW; 
  Methodologies: | Opportunities or limitations of existing methodological practices in CSCW (e.g., participatory design, co-production etc.) or academic norms (data collection, paper publication) towards advancing environmental and climate justice. 
  Submissions are expected to either take the shape of research or position paper (2-4 pages) or a creative contribution, or an example of political, technological, or design intervention or campaign they are working on (with a 300-500 word description). Accepted papers will be added to the workshop website, and at least one author is expected to attend the workshop remotely, and register for the workshop for at least one conference day.  
 16. Afrocentric Collaborative Care: Supporting Context Specific Digital Health and Care   
 Date:  Sat, October 14, 2023  
 Organizers:  Oritsetimeyin Arueyingho, University of Bristol; Nicola J Bidwell, University of Management Namibia; Anicia Peters, National Commission on Research, Science and Technology (NCRST); Jacki O’Neill, Microsoft Africa Research Institute; Oussama Metatla, University of Bristol; Amid Ayobi, University College London; Makuochi Samuel Nkwo, University of Greenwich; Damiete Onyema Lawrence, Cinfores; Rockefeller Zimba, NHS; Hadiza Ismaila, University College London; Hilda Owii, University of Bristol; Saka Abiola Monsur, University of Bristol  
 Format:  Online only  
 Website:  https://africentricareworkshop.blogs.bristol.ac.uk   
 Description:  Non-communicable diseases e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, and cancers etc, are slowly becoming silent epidemics in African countries. Most of them are closely linked with unique clinical manifestations and could go undetected until there is a complication. Management of these diseases requires long-term informal care, and this has resulted in a complex network of relationships between patients, complementary care providers, informal and formal caregivers. Unfortunately, there are not many studies investigating these relationships from a decolonized perspective with the intention of co-designing interventions that are unique to their lived experiences.  
 This workshop aims to bring together researchers working on digital health and care projects in Africa to discuss the implications of existing collaborative care structures and cultures for technology, as well as near future Afrocentric approaches to collaborative care. We aim to highlight existing challenges in technology enabled collaborative care, differentiate them from established challenges in the Global North and identify design opportunities. This workshop will contribute to the growing attention shown to the African continent in CSCW and HCI research more broadly.  
 How to apply:  Interested participants from academia should make two-to-four-page submissions in ACM CHI format that report on work-in-progress, position papers, or reflections on past research on collaborative care in Africa. These papers will be assessed on their appropriateness to the workshop call, their alignment with the workshop themes and their potential to provoke discussion at the workshop. They will be juried by the organisers of the workshop. Other participants such as clinicians or Digital Health enthusiasts will be encouraged to submit reports, posters, or short 90 second videos with their tailored biographies.  
 17. AI through the Eyes of Gen Z

 Organizers:  Nora McDonald, George Mason University; Afsaneh Razi, Drexel University; Karla Badillo-Urquiola, University of Notre Dame; John S. Seberger, Drexel University; Denise Agosto, Drexel University; Pamela J. Wisniewski, Vanderbilt University  
 Format:  Online only  
 Website:  https://aiyouthcscw2023.wordpress.com/   
 Description:  Setting a Research Agenda for Emerging Technologies that Empower Our Future Generation: Artificial intelligence (AI) underpins virtually every experience that we have—from search and social media to generative AI and immersive social virtual reality (SVR). For Generation Z, there is no before AI. As adults, we must humble ourselves to the notion that AI is shaping youths’ world in ways that we don’t understand and we need to listen to them abSout their lived experiences. We invite researchers from academia and industry to participate in a workshop with youth activists to set the agenda for research into how AI-driven emerging technologies affect youth and how to address these challenges. This reflective workshop will amplify youth voices and empower youth and researchers to set an agenda. As part of the workshop, youth activists will participate in a panel and steer the conversation around the agenda for future research. All will participate in group research agenda setting activities to reflect on their experiences with AI technologies and consider ways to tackle these challenges.  
 How to apply:  Submissions can take various forms, such as (1) short bios with a statement of motivation/interest, (2) an academic position paper in the SIGCHI extended abstract format discussing one or more of the workshop themes, or (3) a case study demonstrating relevant work that contributes to one of our themes.  
 18. Can licensing mitigate the negative implications of commercial web scraping?   
 Date:  Sun, October 15, 2023 (10am-4pm)  
 Organizers:  Hanlin Li, University of Texas at Austin; Nicholas Vincent, University of California, Davis; Yacine Jernite, Hugging Face; Nick Merrill, University of California, Berkeley; Jesse Josua Benjamin, Lancaster University; Alek Tarkowski, Open Future  
 Format:  Online only  
 Website:  https://www.licenses.ai/data-licensing-workshop   
 Description:  The rise of prominent AI models such as ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion has brought the scale of commercial web scraping to the forefront attention of content creators and researchers. Billions of webpages and images are used to train these models without content creators’ knowledge, sparking extensive criticism and even lawsuits against AI firms. Amidst such debates, licensing is proposed by researchers and legal experts to be a potential approach to mitigate content creators’ concerns and promote more responsible data reuse. However, it remains unclear what specific licensing terms will be effective to mitigate content creators’ concerns and what sociotechnical environments are necessary to facilitate the use of licensing at scale. This workshop will provide a venue for researchers, content creators, and legal experts to answer these questions.  
 How to apply:  We welcome research abstracts, essays, policy briefs, and articles that address the following aspects of web scraping and licensing. Submissions should be 2-4 pages long and outline the author’s research interests and how they relate to our workshop topics. Authors with accepted work will have 5 minute to present at the virtual workshop, followed by a Q&A with the audience.  
 Understanding the current landscape of web scraping and investigating how firms and developers approach the legal and ethical risks of scraping and aggregating web content. 
  Understanding current practices around licensing among content creators, e.g. how content creators license their content and what rights they would like to preserve when making their content publicly visible. 
  Identifying specific opportunities to operationalize licensing to counter the negative effects of web scraping and other unauthorized data reuses, including but not limited to privacy violation, lack of compensation for content creators, copyright infringements, etc. 
  Examining parallels between licensing and other creator-oriented responsible AI initiatives, such as data stewardship and refusal. 
  To apply, please upload your submission via this Google Form  by Sep 7, 2023. If you have any questions about how to submit, please email Hanlin Li at lihanlin@utexas.edu.

 Format:  Online only  
 Website:  https://sites.google.com/nd.edu/community-ai-cscw-2023/home   
 Description:  The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data-driven technologies has created unprecedented opportunities for enhancing various aspects of society, including child welfare system, human trafficking detection, health systems, and more. However, harnessing the full potential of AI and data for community empowerment requires a deep understanding of the ethical, social, and technical challenges that come with their application.  
 The aim of this workshop is to bring together a diverse group of researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and stakeholders to explore the intersections of AI, data, and social spaces. By creating a space for interdisciplinary discussions, this workshop will foster the exchange of ideas, techniques, and best practices to address the challenges and opportunities that arise in community settings when AI and data-driven decision-making are employed.  
 How to apply:  We invite researchers, practitioners, policymakers, community partners, and other stakeholders with an interest in community-driven AI, to join us in this interactive virtual workshop. This one-day workshop aims to create a collaborative environment where participants can engage in interdisciplinary discussions, share their experiences, and contribute to the development of strategies and frameworks for harnessing the potential of AI in community settings.  
 Interested participants are asked to submit a brief statement of interest, demonstrating their alignment with the workshop goals. Submissions can take one of the following forms:  
 A short bio with a statement of motivation/interest for attending the workshop. 
  A 2-page position paper (includes figures; excludes references) discussing one or more of the workshop themes. 
  A case study showcasing relevant work that contributes to the workshop themes. 
  20. Understanding & Evaluating UX Outcomes at Scale   
 Date:  Sat, October 14, 2023  
 Organizers:  Serena Hillman, Microsoft; Samira Jain, Microsoft; Craig M. MacDonald, Pratt Institute; Elizabeth F Churchill, Google LLC; Carolyn Pang, Oracle; Jofish Kaye, Carelon Digital Platforms; Erick Oduor, Maji.co.ke  
 Format:  Online only  
 Website:  http://uxoutco.me   
 Description:  Evaluating the success of applications from a summative perspective is essential to many industry researchers’ roles, yet a thorough understanding of what to measure and how to bridge business frameworks remains elusive. New technologies and novel ways of interacting with applications have garnered domain-specific interest in evaluating these experiences, but there is yet to be clarity or a path forward for a general methodological approach. While experience outcomes, UX OKRs, UX metrics, etc., are essential elements in HCI research and design, it has not become a core topic in HCI courses. This workshop aims to address this gap by bringing together academics and industry researchers involved in the measurement of success around large-scale applications – applications with a large user base. The objective of this workshop will be to engage in dynamic discussions around current evaluative experiences, how we move forward to produce valuable and unified updates to this topic, and a plan to do so. The workshop will specifically look at the value of writing a State of the Union paper, developing a community (e.g., SIG), and exploring education and training opportunities around this topic.  
 Join us at the CSCW conference to explore and drive progress in evaluating UX outcomes at scale. If you are working on or aspiring to evaluate large-scale applications based on user-centered approaches and metrics, this is the place to collaborate, share experiences, and collectively shape the future direction in this field.  
 How to apply:  Applicants will submit a 2–4-page position paper in the single-column ACM Master Article Submission Template. Papers can discuss past work, propose future work, and/or raise new ideas. We are looking for both experienced researchers in the space as well as those interested in developing the direction. You can reflect on: your involvement around past experiments and learnings, successes, challenges faced so far, interest in the space, and/or objectives or plans for future initiatives. For prompts, refer to Section 5 of the workshop proposal.  
 At least one author of each paper must attend the workshop virtually or in person. Acceptance will be based on quality, relevance, and diversity. We hope accepted papers will collectively represent diverse perspectives, domains, and methods.

 ACM SenSys  
 The ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems (SenSys) introduces a highly selective, single-track forum for research on systems issues of sensors and sensor-enabled smart systems, broadly defined. Systems of smart sensors will revolutionize a wide array of application areas by providing an unprecedented density and fidelity of instrumentation. They also present various systems challenges because of resource constraints, uncertainty, irregularity, mobility, and scale. This conference provides an ideal venue to address research challenges facing the design, development, deployment, use, and fundamental limits of these systems. Sensing systems require contributions from many fields, from wireless communication and networking, embedded systems and hardware, energy harvesting and management, distributed systems and algorithms, data management, and applications, so we welcome cross-disciplinary work.  
 SenSys the leading conference for research on systems of networked sensing and actuation. It is jointly sponsored by ACM SIGCOMM, SIGMOBILE, SIGARCH, SIGOPS, SIGMETRICS, and SIGBED.

  Papers accepted at either of the rounds will be published in the 2023 volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA) and invited to be presented at the SPLASH conference in October 2023.

 PACMPL(OOPSLA) has two rounds  of reviewing. The final outcome of each round can be one of Accept, Revise or Reject.  
 Accept:  Accepted papers will appear in the 2023 volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA).  
 Revise:  Papers in this category are invited to submit a revision to the next round of submissions with a specific set of expectations to be met. When authors resubmit, they should clearly explain how the revisions address the comments of the reviewers, by including a document describing the changes and – if possible – a diff of the PDF as supplementary material. The revised paper will be re-evaluated, and either accepted or rejected. Resubmitted papers will retain the same reviewers throughout the process. Papers with a Revise outcome in Round 2 and an Accept outcome in the subsequent Round 1 will appear in the 2024 volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA).  
 Reject:  Rejected papers will not be included in the 2023 volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA). Papers in this category are not guaranteed a review if resubmitted less than one year from the date of original submission. A paper will be judged to be a resubmission if it is substantially similar to the original submission. The judgment that a paper is a resubmission of the same work and whether, in this case, it will be reviewed or not is at the discretion of the Chair. Obviously, this same policy applies to papers that were rejected for inclusion in the 2022 volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA).  
 Each round  of reviewing consists of two phases  . The first phase evaluates the papers and results in an early notification of Reject, Revise, or Conditional Accept. During the first phase, authors will be able to read their reviews and respond to them. The second phase is restricted to conditionally accepted papers. Authors must make a set of mandatory revisions. The second phase assesses whether the required revisions have been addressed. The outcome can be Accept, Revise or Reject.  
 Submissions   
 Submitted papers (including resubmissions) must be at most 23 pages  using the template below. The references do not count towards this limit. No appendices are allowed on the main paper, instead authors can upload supplementary material with no page or content restrictions, but reviewers may choose to ignore it. The PACMPL templates used for SPLASH (Microsoft Word and LaTeX) can be found at the SIGPLAN author information page  . In particular, authors using LaTeX should use the acmart-pacmpl-template.tex file  (with the acmsmall option). Papers are expected to use author-year citations. Author-year citations may be used as either a noun phrase, such as “The lambda calculus was originally conceived by Church (1932)”, or a parenthetic phase, such as “The lambda calculus (Church 1932) was intended as a foundation for mathematics”.  
 PACMPL uses double-blind reviewing. Authors’ identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted. Papers must  
 omit author names and institutions, 
  use the third person when referencing your work, 
  anonymise supplementary material. 
  Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission; see the DBR FAQ. When in doubt, contact the Review Committee Chairs.  
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy  . Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism  . Submissions are expected to comply with the ACM Policies for Authorship  .  
 Artifacts   
 Authors should indicate with their initial submission if an artifact exists, describe its nature and limitations, and indicate if it will be submitted for evaluation. Accepted papers that fail to provide an artifact will be requested to explain the reason they cannot support replication. It is understood that some papers have no artifacts.  
 Publication   
 PACMPL is a Gold Open Access journal, all papers will be freely available to the public. Authors can voluntarily cover the article processing charge ($400), but payment is not required. The official publication date is the date the journal are made available in the ACM Digital Library. The journal issue and associated papers may be published up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 FAQ   
 Selection Criteria   
 We consider the following criteria when evaluating papers:  
 Novelty:  The paper presents new ideas and results and places them appropriately within the context established by previous research.  
 Importance:  The paper contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the field. We also welcome papers that diverge from the dominant trajectory of the field.  
 Evidence:  The paper presents sufficient evidence supporting its claims, such as proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, case studies, and anecdotes.  
 Clarity:  The paper presents its contributions, methodology and results clearly.  
 Artifacts   
 Q: Are artifacts required?   
 No! It is understood that some papers have no artifacts. But if an artifact is not provided when the claims in the paper refer to an artifact, the authors must explain why their work is not available for repetition.  
 Q: Can a paper be accepted if the artifact is rejected?   
 Yes! The reasons for rejecting an artifact are multiple and often stem from the quality of the packaging.  
 Double-Blinding Submissions (Authors)   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 Use common sense. Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are. The specific guidelines stated in the call for papers are simple: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on amphibious type systems, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on statically typed toads [Smith 2004],” you might say “We extend Smith’s [2004] earlier work on statically typed toads.” Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity.  
 Q: Should I change the name of my system?   
 No.  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?   
 Cite the code in your paper, but remove the URL and, instead say “link to repository removed for double blind review”. If you believe reviewer access to your code would help during author response, contact the Review Committee Chairs.  
 Q: I am submitting an extension of my workshop paper, should I anonymize reference to that work?   
 No. But we recommend you do not use the same title, so that it is clearly distinguishes the papers.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my paper on my web page or arXiv? send it to colleagues? give a talk about it? on social media?   
 We have developed guidelines to help navigate the tension between the normal communication of scientific results and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of authors. Roughly speaking, you may discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are gray areas and trade-offs. Things you may do:  
 Put your submission on your home page. 
  Discuss your work with anyone not on the review committees or reviewers with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. 
  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on arXiv or a similar site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-blind reviewing, etc. 
  Things you should not do:  
 Contact members of the review committee about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. 
  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, OOPSLA paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternately, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. 
  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Review Committee Chairs.

 Announcements   
 Call for Papers, OOPSLA 2023, The ACM Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages, and Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH 2023)  
 Deadline:  4/14/2023  
 ======================================================================== PACMPL Issue OOPSLA 2023 Call for Papers *OOPSLA 2023* will be held as part of "The ACM Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages, and Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH'23)" October 22-27, 2023, Cascais, Portugal https://2023.splashcon.org/track/splash-2023-oopsla ======================================================================== ### Important dates ROUND 2: Submission Deadline: Fri Apr 14, 2023 Author Response: Wed Jun 14 - Fri Jun 16 Author Notification: Fri Jun 30 Submission of Revisions: Mon Aug 14 - Fri Aug 18 Camera ready: Thu Aug 31 Papers accepted will be published in the 2023 volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA) and invited to be presented at the SPLASH conference in October 2023. ### Scope The OOPSLA issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (PACMPL) welcomes papers focusing on all practical and theoretical investigations of programming languages, systems and environments. Papers may target any stage of software development, including requirements, modeling, prototyping, design, implementation, generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance, and reuse of software systems. Contributions may include the development of new tools, techniques, principles, and evaluations. ### Review Process PACMPL(OOPSLA) has two _rounds_ of reviewing. The final outcome of each round can be one of Accept, Revise, or Reject. *Accept*: Accepted papers will appear at the next PACMPL(OOPSLA). *Revise*: Papers in this category are invited to submit a revision to the _next round_ of submissions with a specific set of expectations to be met. When authors resubmit, they should clearly explain how the revisions address the comments of the reviewers. The revised paper will be re-evaluated. Resubmitted papers will retain the same reviewers throughout the process. *Reject*: Rejected papers will not be included in the 2023 volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA). Papers in this category are not guaranteed a review if resubmitted less than one year from the date of original submission. A paper will be judged to be a resubmission if it is substantially similar to the original submission. The judgment that a paper is a resubmission of the same work and whether, in this case, it will be reviewed or not is at the discretion of the Chair. Obviously, this same policy applies to papers that were rejected for inclusion in the 2022 volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA). Each _round_ of reviewing consists of two _phases_. The first phase evaluates the papers and results in an early notification of Reject, Revise, or Conditional Accept. During the first phase, authors will be able to read their reviews and respond to them. The second phase is restricted to conditionally accepted papers. Authors must make a set of mandatory revisions. The second phase assesses whether the required revisions have been addressed. The outcome can be Accept, Revise, or Reject. ### Submissions Submitted papers must be at most **23 pages** in 10 point font. There is no page limit on references. No appendices are allowed on the main paper, instead authors can upload supplementary material with no page or content restrictions, but reviewers may choose to ignore it. Submissions must adhere to the "ACM Small" template available from [the ACM](http://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions). Papers are expected to use author-year citations. Author-year citations may be used as either a noun phrase, such as "The lambda calculus was originally conceived by Church [1932]", or a parenthetic phase, such as "The lambda calculus [Church 1932] was intended as a foundation for mathematics". PACMPL uses double-blind reviewing. Authors' identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted. Papers must 1. omit author names and institutions 2. use the third person when referencing your work 3. anonymize supplementary material. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission; see the FAQ on the OOPSLA 2023 website for details. When in doubt, contact the Review Committee Chairs. Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by [SIGPLAN's Republication Policy](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication). Submitters should also be aware of [ACM's Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism](http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy). Submissions are expected to comply with the [ACM Policies for Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/information-for-authors). ### Artifacts Authors should indicate with their initial submission if an artifact exists, describe its nature and limitations, and indicate if it will be submitted for evaluation. Accepted papers that fail to provide an artifact will be requested to explain the reason they cannot support replication. It is understood that some papers have no artifacts. ### Publication PACMPL is a Gold Open Access journal, all papers will be freely available to the public. Authors can voluntarily cover the article processing charge ($400), but payment is not required. The official publication date is the date when the journal is made available in the ACM Digital Library. The journal issue and associated papers may be published up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. ### Additional Information Consult FAQ in Call for Papers at: https://2023.splashcon.org/track/splash-2023-oopsla ### Review Committee PC Chair: Mira Mezini (TU Darmstadt) Derek Dreyer (MPI-SWS, DE)- Associate Chair Sophia Drosopolou (Facebook; Imperial College, UK)- Associate Chair Patrick Eugster (USI, Switzerland; Purdue U.)- Associate Chair Shriram Krishnamurthi (Brown University, USA)- Associate Chair Jonathan Aldrich (CMU, USA) Karim Ali (U.

Conference announcements   
 Round 2 Call for Papers -  
  SPLASH2023 - Conference on Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications (OOPSLA'2023)  
   
 Date: Tue, 14 Feb 2023 14:38:23 +0800 From: Andreea Costea <andreeac@comp.nus.edu.sg> To: Seworld <seworld@sigsoft.org> Subject: [SEWORLD] OOPSLA 2023 - Round 2 CFP Organization: National University of Singapore ======================================================================== PACMPL Issue OOPSLA 2023 Call for Papers OOPSLA 2023 will be held as part of The ACM Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages, and Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH'23) October 22-27, 2023, Cascais, Portugal https://2023.splashcon.org/track/splash-2023-oopsla  ======================================================================== ### Important dates Submission Deadline: Fri Apr 14, 2023 Author Response: Wed Jun 14 - Fri Jun 16 Author Notification: Fri Jun 30 Submission of Revisions: Mon Aug 14 - Fri Aug 18 Camera ready: Thu Aug 31 Papers accepted will be published in the 2023 volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA) and invited to be presented at the SPLASH conference in October 2023. ### Scope The OOPSLA issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (PACMPL) welcomes papers focusing on all practical and theoretical investigations of programming languages, systems and environments. Papers may target any stage of software development, including requirements, modeling, prototyping, design, implementation, generation analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance, and reuse of software systems. Contributions may include the development of new tools, techniques, principles, and evaluations. ### Review Process PACMPL(OOPSLA) has two _rounds_ of reviewing. The final outcome of each round can be one of Accept, Revise, or Reject. *Accept*: Accepted papers will appear at the next PACMPL(OOPSLA). *Revise*: Papers in this category are invited to submit a revision to the _next round_ of submissions with a specific set of expectations to be met. When authors resubmit, they should clearly explain how the revisions address the comments of the reviewers. The revised paper will be re-evaluated. Resubmitted papers will retain the same reviewers throughout the process. *Reject*: Rejected papers will not be included in the 2023 volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA). Papers in this category are not guaranteed a review if resubmitted less than one year from the date of original submission. A paper will be judged to be a resubmission if it is substantially similar to the original submission. The judgment that a paper is a resubmission of the same work and whether, in this case, it will be reviewed or not is at the discretion of the Chair. Obviously, this same policy applies to papers that were rejected for inclusion in the 2022 volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA). Each _round_ of reviewing consists of two _phases_. The first phase evaluates the papers and results in an early notification of Reject Revise, or Conditional Accept. During the first phase, authors will be able to read their reviews and respond to them. The second phase is restricted to conditionally accepted papers. Authors must make a set of mandatory revisions. The second phase assesses whether the required revisions have been addressed. The outcome can be Accept, Revise, or Reject. ### Submissions Submitted papers must be at most **23 pages** in 10 point font. There is no page limit on references. No appendices are allowed on the main paper, instead authors can upload supplementary material with no page or content restrictions, but reviewers may choose to ignore it. Submissions must adhere to the "ACM Small" template available from [the ACM]( http://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions  ). Papers are expected to use author-year citations. Author-year citations may be used as either a noun phrase, such as "The lambda calculus was originally conceived by Church [1932]", or a parenthetic phase, such as "The lambda calculus [Church 1932] was intended as a foundation for mathematics". PACMPL uses double-blind reviewing. Authors' identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted. Papers must omit author names and institutions use the third person when referencing your work anonymize supplementary material. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission; see the FAQ on the OOPSLA 2023 website for details. When in doubt, contact the Review Committee Chairs. Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by [SIGPLAN's Republication Policy]( http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication  ). Submitters should also be aware of [ACM's Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism]( http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy  ). Submissions are expected to comply with the [ACM Policies for Authorship]( https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/information-for-authors  ). ### Artifacts Authors should indicate with their initial submission if an artifact exists, describe its nature and limitations, and indicate if it will be submitted for evaluation. Accepted papers that fail to provide an artifact will be requested to explain the reason they cannot support replication. It is understood that some papers have no artifacts. ### Publication PACMPL is a Gold Open Access journal, all papers will be freely available to the public. Authors can voluntarily cover the article processing charge ($400), but payment is not required. The official publication date is the date when the journal is made available in the ACM Digital Library. The journal issue and associated papers may be published up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. ### Additional Information Consult FAQ in Call for Papers at: https://2023.splashcon.org/track/splash-2023-oopsla  ### Review Committee PC Chair: Mira Mezini (TU Darmstadt) Derek Dreyer (MPI-SWS, DE)- Associate Chair Sophia Drosopolou (Facebook; Imperial College, UK)- Associate Chair Patrick Eugster (USI, Switzerland; Purdue U.)- Associate Chair Shriram Krishnamurthi (Brown University, USA)- Associate Chair Jonathan Aldrich (CMU, USA) Karim Ali (U.

  Supporters | Welcome  
 The ACM SIGSPATIAL  International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems 2023 (ACM SIGSPATIAL 2023)  , the thirty-first edition, will be held in Hamburg, Germany  . The conference began as a series of symposia and workshops starting in 1993 with the aim of bringing together researchers, developers, users, and practitioners in relation to novel systems based on geospatial data and knowledge, and fostering interdisciplinary discussions and research in all aspects of geographic information systems. The conference provides a forum for original research contributions covering all conceptual, design, and implementation aspects of geospatial data ranging from applications, user interfaces, and visualization to data storage and query processing and indexing. The conference is the premier annual event of the ACM Special Interest Group on Spatial Information (ACM SIGSPATIAL). Researchers, students, and practitioners are invited to submit their contributions to ACM SIGSPATIAL 2023.

 Paper Submissions (with and without artifacts)   
 We solicit research papers related to the following areas:  
 FPGA Architecture | : Architectures for programmable logic fabrics or their components, including routing, flexible logic cells, embedded blocks (memory, DSP, processors), and I/O interfaces. Novel commercial architectures and architectural features. 
  FPGA Circuit Design | : Circuits and layout techniques for the design of FPGAs. Impact of future process and design technologies on FPGAs as well as novel memory or nano-scale devices. Methods for analyzing and improving static and dynamic power consumption, power and clock distribution, yield, manufacturability, security, reliability, and testability. 
  CAD for FPGAs | : Algorithms for synthesis, technology mapping, logic and timing optimization, clustering, placement, and routing of FPGAs. Novel design software for system-level partitioning, debug, and verification. Algorithms for modeling, analysis and optimization of timing and power. 
  High-Level Abstractions and Tools for FPGAs | : General-purpose and domain-specific languages, tools, and techniques to facilitate the design, debugging and verification of FPGA-based applications and systems. Novel hardware/software co-design and high-level synthesis methodologies enabling digital signal processing, compute acceleration, networking, machine learning, and embedded systems. 
  FPGA-based and FPGA-like Computing Engines | : Systems and software for compiled accelerators, reconfigurable/adaptive computing, and rapid-prototyping. Programmable overlay architectures implemented using FPGAs. 
  Applications and Design Studies: | Implementation of novel designs on FPGAs establishing state-of-the-art in high-performance, low-power, security, or high-reliability. Designs leveraging unique capabilities of FPGA architectures or demonstrating significant improvements over alternative programmable technologies (e.g., CPU, GPU). Design studies or architecture explorations enabling improvement of FPGA architectures. 
  AI/ML for and on FPGAs: | Architectures and implementations of FPGA-based processors for AI/ML algorithms, such as Small Language Models and Large Language Models. Novel uses of AI models to aid in the design and programming of FPGAs. 
  Research submissions can be in either of two categories:  
 Regular | — at most 10 pages (excluding references), for a regular presentation at the conference. 
  Short | — at most 6 pages (excluding references), for a brief presentation. 
  A paper submitted as either regular or short will only be considered in that category and may include artifacts if desired (see below for more details on artifact submission and evaluation).  
   
 Submission Process   
 Submissions of all types should be made in the form of an English language PDF file. Papers should use the sigconf ACM format template posted at http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template/  . LaTeX users should use the format used in the sample-sigconf.pdf file under the Samples folder of the zipped master file (available through the LaTeX link). Microsoft Word users can download the file Interim layout.docx under the Word Authors section of the page. Abstract and paper submissions in PDF must be received by 11:59 PM AoE (Anywhere-on-Earth time zone).  
 Submissions will be considered for acceptance as regular or short papers. A paper submitted to the regular or short category will only be considered in that category. Regular or short submissions will also be considered for acceptance as a poster. Once a paper has been submitted, its authorship list is considered to be fixed and final.  
 By submitting articles to an ACM Publication, authors are hereby acknowledging that they and their co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies), including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects). Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of their paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Authors should ensure that they and their co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  (https://orcid.org/register), so that they can complete the publishing process for accepted papers. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and ACM has recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of their published authors  (https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs). The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2023. ACM is committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution, and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; authors’ ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
   
 Double Blind Policy   
 The FPGA Symposium uses a double-blind reviewing system. Manuscripts must not identify authors or their affiliations; those that do will not be considered. References to the authors’ prior work should be made in the third person, in the same way one would reference work by others. If necessary to maintain anonymity, citations may be shown as “Removed for blind review,” but consider that this may impede a thorough review if the removed citation is crucial to understanding the submission. When necessary, authors should cite widely-available Open Source software website(s) without claiming ownership. Grant numbers and other government markings should also be blinded during the review process. Placing a preliminary version of the unpublished paper on arXiv is not disqualifying, but it is also not encouraged. Similarly, if a paper can be unblinded by active search, this is not considered to undermine the spirit of the double-blind review. However, there are resources to blind open-source repositories for review, including: https://github.com/tdurieux/anonymous_github  .  
 If you have questions about how to meet these guidelines, please contact the program chair before the submission deadline.  
   
 Reviewer Conflict Policy   
 During paper submission, all author(s) conflicts must be registered with all possible program committee members. Conflicts are defined as all relationships that would prevent a reviewer from objectively evaluating the submitted work. This includes, but is not limited to, having within the past 5 years, 1) co-authored a publication, or 2) shared a funding award, and 3) shared at least one institutional affiliation. Note: if a conflict is left undeclared or a nonexistent conflict is declared in an attempt to manipulate the review process, the submission may be rejected.  
 For more information about the ACM Conflict of Interest Policy, see: https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest   
   
 Originality of Submissions   
 Papers submitted are guaranteed by the authors to be unique manuscripts and not previously published, currently accepted or under consideration for acceptance at another venue. They cannot be substantially similar to any other current/future conference, journal, or workshop submission(s) unless the content appeared at a venue that does not have archived proceedings.  
   
 Rebuttal Process   
 The conference review process includes a rebuttal phase for authors to provide an optional response to reviewers’ questions and comments. This information is considered during the final deliberation process.  
   
 Author participation   
 For inclusion in the ACM digital library, at least one of the authors of each accepted submission is required to present the work. Accommodations will be made for the authors who face travel restrictions or unforeseen difficulties with travel (more instruction will be available after the camera-ready submission).  
   
 Best Paper Award   
 Authors of this year’s best manuscripts will be eligible for the conference’s best paper awards. They will also be invited to extend their work for consideration in a special issue of ACM’s Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems (TRETS).  
   
 Artifact Evaluation   
 The conference will allow authors to submit accompanying artifacts for their paper submissions for evaluation. This process will allow ACM recognized badges to be associated with the final publication. The inclusion of artifacts with a submission is not required for a paper submission nor will any preference be given to submissions with artifacts over those without. Papers and artifacts will be subjected to separate and independent review processes. Artifact evaluation must NOT interfere with the double blind reviewing process of their accompanying papers, so all accompanying links in the paper to the artifacts should be blinded. All authors will be required at the time of paper submission to indicate if there will also be associated artifacts for evaluation. If artifacts will be included, a descriptor of their nature will be required.  
 For more information, see: https://isfpga.org/artifact-evaluation/   
   
 Diversity and Inclusion   
 The open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and expression are central to the aims and goals of the conference. The organizers aim and commit to providing a harassment-free accessible and pleasant conference experience with equity in rights for all. We want every participant to feel welcome, included and safe at the conference.  
 For more information, see: https://isfpga.org/statement-on-diversity-and-inclusion/

 IT Undergraduate Programs (USA)  

 Thanks to the SIGITE-funded research of Barry M. Lunt, Brady Redfearn, Elizabeth Mitchell, Samuel Tenney, and Cayman Williams (all from Brigham Young University), we can provide a preliminary list of Information Technology (IT) bachelor’s programs in the United States. The list contains 220 universities with IT-like undergraduate programs.  
 Due to widespread variation in the names of academic degree programs, one cannot simply count those named Information Technology. At SIGITE 2017, a framework was presented ( see paper  ) for identifying IT programs and for evaluating their compliance to an accepted standard. This framework has been applied throughout this research. They first compiled a list of prospective IT programs to research. Each university on the list was researched by looking at their university webpage in search of a list of computing majors listed at that university. If, at a glance, these program’s required courses look similar to those required in an IT program, the program was evaluated and given a numerical score compliance factor, as compared to the standard, no matter the name of the major. This compliance factor was calculated using the assessment form that is included in their SIGITE paper (the larger the number the more compliant the program to the IT Model Curricula). The results of their analysis are presented below. View their data as Excel files:  
 2021 data (Undergraduate Programs only) 
  2019 data (Undergraduate Programs only) 
  2012 data 
  Note: The compliance score shown here is not meant to indicate that one program is better or weaker than another. Rather it is the score calculated by the authors in the above study to show a program’s relative compliance to the official ACM IT curricula.

 About  CIKM     
  The Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM) provides an international forum for presentation and discussion of research on information and knowledge management, as well as recent advances on data and knowledge bases. The purpose of the conference is to identify challenging problems facing the development of future knowledge and information systems, and to shape future directions of research by soliciting and reviewing high quality, applied and theoretical research findings. An important part of the conference is the Workshops program which focuses on timely research challenges and initiatives. CIKM has a strong tradition of workshops devoted to emerging areas of database management, IR, and related fields.   

   Warning for Spam Email from Travellerpoint   
 There are scam e-mails sent to OC members (and later on probably also to authors once the papers are online) that pretend to organize travels (see below), Travellerpoint  is known to send. This is known from other conferences as well, see:

 10-Year Impact Award  
   
 The 10-Year Impact Award was awarded to  
 Roman Rädle, Hans-Christian Jetter, Nicolai Marquardt, Harald Reiterer, and Yvonne Rogers  for their work on  
 HuddleLamp: Spatially-Aware Mobile Displays for Ad-hoc Around-the-Table Collaboration   
 https://doi.org/10.1145/2669485.2669500   
  The Impact Award is awarded to a paper published at ISS (ITS in the past) a decade ago. This year’s award went to a paper published at ITS 2014. The Impact Award recipients were decided by a jury consisting of this year’s Papers Chairs (ISS 2023), Papers Chairs from ITS 2014, as well as senior members of the community.  
 The award is given to a paper that has had a significant impact on the ISS community, the broader human-computer interaction community, or the industry. The jury evaluated papers from a number of perspectives, like citations and how they developed over time, which venues and what kinds of papers were citing the work, and the extent of forward-thinking ideas, concepts, or prototypes that would later be adopted widely.  
   
 Roman Rädle (middle) attended the conference in person to receive the award from ISS 2023 Papers Co-Chairs, Ville Mäkelä (left) and Andrés Lucero (right).    
 Congratulations to the award recipients!

  Call for Bids 
  ISS Conference Series 

  ACM Interactive Surfaces and Spaces (ISS)  
   
 Welcome!  
 We welcome you to the ACM International Conference on Interactive Surfaces and Spaces. As an annual conference series starting in 2006, ACM ISS (formerly known as ACM ITS, International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces) is the premier venue for research addressing the design, development and use of new and emerging tabletop, digital surface, interactive spaces and multi-surface technologies. Over the years ISS has been a venue for research and applications of interactive surfaces as well as spaces, which has been acknowledged by the incorporation of 'Space' into our conference identity since 2016.  
 Interactive Surfaces and Spaces increasingly pervade our everyday life, appearing in various sizes, shapes, and application contexts, offering a rich variety of ways to interact.  
 The ISS steering committee members are looking forward to your contribution and participation at the ISS.  
   
 Upcoming Event  
    
 Past Events  

 Call for bids: Hosting future ISS Conferences  
   
 We are soliciting expressions of interest for chairing and hosting the ACM Interactive Surfaces and Spaces (formerly ACM Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces) conference in 2025 or 2026.  
 ISS is a successful ACM conference series that consistently attracts up to 200 attendees and high-quality paper submissions. It is celebrating its 19 th  edition in Vancouver, BC, Canada, from October 27-30, 2024 (see https://iss.acm.org/2024/  ).  
 As a first step before submitting a PDF with your bid, you might want to send us a lightweight expression of interest. If you are interested in hosting ISS we just need you to reply with an e-mail that indicates:  
 Main contact person (at least provisionally), and e-mail. 
  Possible geographical location (no need for detail at the moment—a hotel, city, or region is OK). 
  Which of 2025 or 2026 you are interested in organizing (it's okay to indicate one as a backup). 
  We welcome bids from teams hosting other conferences (i.e., we are open to co-location).  
 After your e-mail we will follow up about further details (e.g., putting together an organizing team), selecting dates, etc.  
  Alternatively, you might also send us the complete bid directly as a PDF document with the content as indicated below.  
 In either case, please get back to us by responding to the ACM ISS steering committee ( steering@iss.acm.org  ).  
   
 Bidding Process for ACM ISS  
 A call for bids for ACM ISS is issued by the SC Chair (typically, in November) and sent to all the members of the ACM ISS Program Committee and the wider ACM ISS community. Bids will continue to be accepted until the venues are decided. We will begin reviewing bids as they are received. As a formal bid, bidders should submit a single PDF document to the SC with the following information:  
 The proposal should address each aspect outlined below (approx. 5-6 pages). A PDF document providing further details on the content of the bid can be found here  .  Based on the merits of the proposals and when the proposals are submitted, the committee will choose the top candidates and then a finalist will be chosen and announced.   
 Location  
 Since ISS is an international forum, we expect that attendees travel from different parts of the world to the conference location. It is important that the proposed location is conveniently located for all attendees to reach by available means of transportation. Learning from experiences during the worldwide pandemic, we appreciate the inclusion of concepts for running hybrid conferences.  
   
 Time  
 ISS conferences have been held at various times during around early / mid November. Your bid should include a proposed time within that range with key dates (e.g., paper submission and notification). The choice of time should also take into account the weather conditions of the proposed location to avoid potential weather-caused travel delays and potential conflicts with other conferences and their submission deadlines (e.g., CHI, CSCW and most importantly UIST).  
   
 Venue  
 ISS officially includes four days with the workshops and tutorials on its first day, which need to be hosted in separate rooms (10-20 people) in parallel. To encourage interaction among the attendees, during the main conference, it is also desirable to have additional space at the venue to put up ISS posters for the attendees to visit during coffee breaks.  
   
 Accommodation & Travel Costs  
 Most attendees will travel by plane and need accommodation during the conference period. One of the responsibilities of the conference hosts/organizers is to locate and reserve a bulk of affordable lodging for attendees. Please describe the proposed accommodation options, including the price range of the hotel rooms and the distance to the main venue and approximate travel costs, at the time of the conference from major centres in Europe, US, Asia/Pacific.  
   
 Provisionary Budget Plan  
 The proposal should also include a provisional budget plan, outlining the cost of major items, including the rental of conference venue, cost/per person for the reception and banquet, and the estimated conference registration fee. Please consider including meals for participants into the budget.  
   
 Hosts/Organizers  
 Conference hosts/organizers should have knowledge of the ISS community (e.g., having attended and published regularly at ISS) and have experience with conference organization. One of the main ISS goals is to bring together people from diverse backgrounds. So ensuring the diversity of the organizing committee is highly encouraged and preferred. Please include short bios of the key hosts/organizers and roles of individuals, including the conference chair(s). Note that ISS uses the PACM HCI journal model of publishing, so Track Chairs are selected separately and are involved in the editorial process across multiple years, though we welcome suggestions.  

 The SC will attempt to balance the location of accepted bids to reflect the interests , diversity and geographical location of the community.  

 Mission Statement  
 The ACM Interactive Surfaces and Spaces (ISS) Steering Committee promotes and maintains the ACM ISS conference as the premiere venue for researchers and practitioners interested in the design, development and use of new and emerging tabletop, digital surface, and multi-surface technologies as well as interactive spaces.

 The steering committee (SC) consists of six (6) to eight (8) long-time ISS community members who have strong engagement with the ISS community and have been invited to serve on the committee. Members normally serve on the SC for five (5) years. The SC is lead by a Chair, who is elected by the SC. An outgoing Chair may also advise the Chair to help with knowledge transfer. The SC should represent the diversity of the ISS community.

 Tasks and Duties  
 Steering Committee Responsibilities  
 The ISS Steering committee is responsible for:  
 soliciting bids for people interested in organizing a future ISS conference and continuity of the conference, 
  making the decision on where the ISS conference is held every year, 
  providing advice to and communicating with each year's ISS conference chairs, 
  developing the spirit and general direction of ISS and specifically the financial sustainability, the publication model and diversity of the conference. 
  ensuring the highest quality for the program of the conference, 
  promoting the ISS conference series to academia, industry and the public, 
  participating in the 10-year best paper selection process, 
  interfacing to ACM SIGCHI and other HCI sister conferences. 
    
 Steering Committee Duties  
 Members of the SC are expected to attend the annual ACM ISS Steering Committee meeting during the annual conference (in person ideally but via video conference in lieu of this). In addition SC members are expected to take part in the three-monthly video conferences. A member of the SC is expected to be actively involved in the conference series which can include, attending the annual conference, submitting papers, organising workshops, running tutorials, contributing to the SC discussion and decision process and attending SC meetings.  

 Membership  
 How to become an ACM ISS SC member?  
 The SC will invite future members, by choosing among the past general and program chairs of the ISS conference and people involved in ACM ISS over several years. The SC is expected to have less than 8 members and more than 6. People will drop of the SC after a maximum period of 5 years. Membership of a SC member terminates when (s)he is frequently inactive. Along with participation, the SC mailing list serves as an archive of members' activities and should be reported on by the chair of the SC at the start of each annual steering committee meeting.  
 Steering Committee Chair  
 From January of 2018 the term as SC Chair lasts two years. The SC chair is chosen among members of the SC, following a vote.  
   
 SC Decision Process  
 Any SC member can raise an issue by sending an e-mail to the list of all SC members. Every SC member must reply to the mail on the list, describing her/his position within 10 days. If no consensus is apparent, the chair calls for a formal vote (Plurality voting) by email. Every SC member must reply sending her/his vote on the list within a week. A SC member is conflicted with voting for a bid to host a conference, if the SC member is general or program chair of the proposed bid. The member can talk part in the discussion, but it not allowed to vote.  

 Award Process  
 10-year Impact Award Selection Process  
 The program chairs of the current year make the selection of the TOP 3-5 papers of the conference and select the 10-years impact award. One program chair assembles the jury and starts the discussion within the jury. The jury typically consists of:  
 1x PC chair of conference year-1 year 
  2x PC chair of conference year-10 years 
  1x SC member 
  1x ITS "Senior member" of the community

  Enabling Long-Range Underwater Backscatter via Van Atta Acoustic Networks  
  
 Aline Eid ( Massachusetts Institute of Technology / University of Michigan  ), Jack Rademacher, Waleed Akbar, Purui Wang, Ahmed Allam, Fadel Adib ( Massachusetts Institute of Technology  ) 

 Abstract:  We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of Van Atta Acoustic Backscatter (VAB), a technology that enables long-range, ultra-low-power networking in underwater environments. At the core of VAB is a novel, scalable underwater backscatter architecture that bridges recent advances in RF backscatter (Van Atta architectures) with ultra-low-power underwater acoustic networks. Our design introduces multiple innovations across the networking stack, which enable it to overcome unique challenges that arise from the electro-mechanical properties of underwater backscatter and the challenging nature of low-power underwater acoustic channels. We implemented our design in an end-to-end system, and evaluated it in over 1,500 real-world experimental trials in a river and the ocean. Our evaluation demonstrates that VAB achieves a communication range that exceeds 300m in round trip backscatter across orientations (at BER of 10 −3  ). We compared our design head-to-head with past state-of-the-art systems, demonstrating a 15× improvement in communication range at the same throughput and power. By realizing hundreds of meters of range in underwater backscatter, this paper presents the first practical system capable of coastal monitoring applications. Finally, our evaluation represents the first experimental validation of underwater backscatter in the ocean. 
  Enabling Ubiquitous WiFi Sensing with Beamforming Reports  
  Artifacts Available

 Abstract:  Wi-Fi sensing systems leverage wireless signals from widely deployed Wi-Fi devices to realize sensing for a broad range of applications. However, current Wi-Fi sensing systems heavily rely on channel state information (CSI) to learn the signal propagation characteristics, while the availability of CSI is highly dependent on specific Wi-Fi chipsets. Through a city-scale measurement, we discover that the availability of CSI is extremely limited in operational Wi-Fi devices. In this work, we propose a new wireless sensing system called BeamSense that exploits compressed beamforming reports (CBR). Due to the extensive support of transmit beamforming in operational Wi-Fi devices, CBR is commonly accessible and hence enables a ubiquitous sensing capability. BeamSense adopts a novel multi-path estimation algorithm that can efficiently and accurately map bidirectional CBR to a multi-path channel based on intrinsic fingerprints. We implement BeamSense on several prevalent models of Wi-Fi devices and evaluated its performance with microbenchmarks and three representative Wi-Fi sensing applications. The results show that BeamSense is capable of enabling existing CSI-based sensing algorithms to work with CBR with high sensing accuracy and improved generalizability. 
  Underwater 3D positioning on smart devices

 Tuochao Chen, Justin Chan, Shyamnath Gollakota ( University of Washington  ) 

 Abstract:  The emergence of water-proof mobile and wearable devices (e.g., Garmin Descent and Apple Watch Ultra) designed for underwater activities like professional scuba diving, opens up opportunities for underwater networking and localization capabilities on these devices. Here, we present the first underwater acoustic positioning system for smart devices. Unlike conventional systems that use floating buoys as anchors at known locations, we design a system where a dive leader can compute the relative positions of all other divers, without any external infrastructure. Our intuition is that in a well-connected network of devices, if we compute the pairwise distances, we can determine the shape of the network topology. By incorporating orientation information about a single diver who is in the visual range of the leader device, we can then estimate the positions of all the remaining divers, even if they are not within sight. We address various practical problems including detecting erroneous distance estimates, addressing rotational and flipping ambiguities as well as designing a distributed timestamp protocol that scales linearly with the number of devices. Our evaluations show that our distributed system running on underwater deployments of 4-5 commodity smart devices can perform pairwise ranging and localization with median errors of 0.5-0.9 m and 0.9-1.6 m.

  A Millimeter Wave Backscatter Network for Two-Way Communication and Localization  
  
 Haofan Lu, Mohammad Hossein Mazaheri, Reza Rezvani, Omid Abari ( UCLA  ) 

 Abstract:  Millimeter wave (mmWave) technology enables wireless devices to communicate using very high-frequency signals. Operating at those frequencies provides larger bandwidth which can be used to enable high-data-rate links, and very accurate localization of devices. However, radios operating at high-frequencies consume significant amount of power, making them unsuitable for applications with limited energy sources. This paper presents MilBack, a backscatter network operating at mmWave bands. Backscattering is the most energy-efficient wireless communication technique, where nodes piggyback their data on an access point's signal instead of generating their own signals. Eliminating the need for signal generation significantly reduces the energy-consumption of the nodes. In contrast to past mmWave backscatter work which supports only uplink, MilBack is the first mmWave backscatter network which supports uplink, downlink and accurate localization. MilBack addresses the key challenges that prevent existing backscatter networks to enable both uplink and downlink at mmWave bands. We implemented MilBack and evaluated its performance empirically. Our results show that MilBack is capable of achieving accurate localization, uplink and downlink communication at up to 10 m while consuming only 32 mW and 18 mW, respectively.

 Abstract:  Molecular networks have the potential to enable bio-implants and biological nano-machines to communicate inside the human body. Molecular networks send and receive data between nodes by releasing molecules into the bloodstream. In this work, we explore how we can scale molecular networks from a single transmitter single receiver paradigm to multiple transmitters that can concurrently send data to a receiver. We identify unique challenges in enabling multiple access in molecular networks that prevent us from using standard multiple access protocols. These challenges include the lack of synchronization and feedback, the non-negativity of molecular signals, the extremely long tail of the molecular channel leading to high ISI (Inter-Symbol-Interference), and the limited types of molecules that can be used for communication. We present MoMA (Molecular Multiple Access), a protocol that enables a molecular network with multiple transmitters. We introduce packet detection, channel estimation, and encoding/decoding schemes that leverage the unique properties of molecular networks to address the above challenges. We evaluate MoMA on a synthetic experimental testbed and demonstrate that it can scale up to four transmitters while significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art.

  Taming the transient while reconfiguring BGP  
  Artifacts Available   Artifacts Evaluated - Functional   
 Tibor Schneider, Roland Schmid ( ETH Zürich  ), Stefano Vissicchio ( University College London  ), Laurent Vanbever ( ETH Zürich  ) 

 Abstract:  BGP reconfigurations are a daily occurrence for most network operators, especially in large networks. Yet, performing safe and robust BGP reconfiguration changes is still an open problem. Few BGP reconfiguration techniques exist, and they are either (i)  unsafe, because they ignore transient states, which can easily lead to invariant violations; or (ii)  impractical, as they duplicate the entire routing and forwarding states, and require special hardware. | In this paper, we introduce Chameleon, the first BGP reconfiguration framework capable of maintaining correctness throughout a reconfiguration campaign while relying on standard BGP functionalities and minimizing state duplication. Akin to concurrency coordination in distributed systems, Chameleon models the reconfiguration process with happens-before relations. This modeling allows us to capture the safety properties of transient BGP states. We then use this knowledge to precisely control the BGP route propagation and convergence, so that input invariants are provably preserved at any time during the reconfiguration. | We fully implement Chameleon and evaluate it in both testbeds and simulations, on real-world topologies and large-scale reconfiguration scenarios. In most experiments, our system computes reconfiguration plans within a minute, and performs them from start to finish in a few minutes, with minimal overhead. 
  Lightyear: Using Modularity to Scale BGP Control Plane Verification  
  
 Alan Tang ( UCLA  ), Ryan Beckett ( Microsoft Research  ), Steven Benaloh, Karthick Jayaraman, Tejas Patil ( Microsoft  ), Todd Millstein, George Varghese ( UCLA  ) 

 Abstract:  Current network control plane verification tools cannot scale to large networks because of the complexity of jointly reasoning about the behaviors of all network nodes. We present a modular  approach to control plane verification, where end-to-end network properties are verified via a set of purely local  checks on individual nodes and edges. The approach targets verification of reachability properties for BGP configurations, and provides guarantees in the face of arbitrary external route announcements and, for some properties, arbitrary node/link failures. We have proven the approach correct and implemented it in a tool Lightyear. Experimentally we show Lightyear scales dramatically better than prior control plane verifiers. Further, Lightyear has been used for six months to verify properties of a major cloud provider network containing hundreds of routers and tens of thousands of edges, finding and fixing bugs in the process. To our knowledge no prior control-plane verification tool has been shown to scale to that size and complexity. Our modular approach also makes it easy to localize configuration errors and enables incremental re-verification.

 Abstract:  As the solitary inter-domain protocol, BGP plays an important role in today’s Internet. Its failures threaten network stability and will usually result in large-scale packet losses. Thus, the non-stop routing (NSR) capability that protects inter-domain connectivity from being disrupted by various failures, is critical to any Autonomous System (AS) operator. Replicating the BGP and underlying TCP connection status is key to realizing NSR. But existing NSR solutions, which heavily rely on OS kernel modifications, have become impractical due to providers’ adoption of virtualized network gateways for better scalability and manageability. | In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing TENSOR, which incorporates a novel kernel-modification-free replication design and lightweight architecture. More concretely, the kernel-modification-free replication design mitigates the reliance on OS kernel modification and hence allows the virtualization of the network gateway. Meanwhile, lightweight virtualization provides strong performance guarantees and improves system reliability. Moreover, TENSOR provides a solution to the split-brain problem that affects NSR solutions. Through extensive experiments, we show that TENSOR realizes NSR while bearing little overhead compared to open-source BGP implementations. Further, our two-year operational experience on a fleet of 400 servers controlling over 31,000 BGP peering connections demonstrates that TENSOR reduces the development, deployment, and maintenance costs significantly – at least by factors of 20, 5, and 10, respectively, while retaining the same SLA with the NSR-enabled routers.

 Abstract:  Batfish is a tool to analyze network configurations and forwarding. It has evolved from a research prototype to an industrial-strength product, guided by scalability, fidelity, and usability challenges encountered when analyzing complex, real-world networks. We share key lessons from this evolution, including how Datalog had significant limitations when generating and analyzing forwarding state and how binary decision diagrams (BDDs) proved highly versatile. We also describe our new techniques for addressing real-world challenges, which increase Batfish performance by three orders of magnitude and enable high-fidelity analysis of networks with thousands of nodes within minutes.

 Abstract:  We present P4Testgen, a test oracle for the P4 16  language. P4Testgen supports automatic test generation for any P4 target and is designed to be extensible to many P4 targets. It models the complete semantics of the target's packet-processing pipeline including the P4 language, architectures and externs, and target-specific extensions. To handle non-deterministic behaviors and complex externs (e.g., checksums and hash functions), P4Testgen uses taint tracking and concolic execution. It also provides path selection strategies that reduce the number of tests required to achieve full coverage. | We have instantiated P4Testgen for the V1model, eBPF, PNA, and Tofino P4 architectures. Each extension required effort commensurate with the complexity of the target. We validated the tests generated by P4Testgen by running them across the entire P4C test suite as well as the programs supplied with the Tofino P4 Studio. Using the tool, we have also confirmed 25 bugs in mature, production toolchains for BMv2 and Tofino.

 Abstract:  Centralized data plane verification (DPV) faces significant scalability issues in large networks (i.e., the verifier being a performance bottleneck and single point of failure and requiring a reliable management network). In this paper, we tackle the scalability challenge of DPV by introducing Tulkun, a distributed, on-device DPV framework. Our key insight is that DPV can be transformed into a counting problem on a directed acyclic graph, which can be naturally decomposed into lightweight tasks executed at network devices, enabling fast data plane checking in networks of various scales and types. With this insight, Tulkun consists of (1) a declarative invariant specification language, (2) a planner that employs a novel data structure DVNet to systematically decompose global verification into on-device counting tasks, (3) a distributed verification messaging (DVM) protocol that specifies how on-device verifiers efficiently communicate task results to jointly verify the invariants, and (4) a mechanism to verify invariant fault-tolerance with minimal involvement of the planner. Extensive experiments with real-world datasets (WAN/LAN/DC) show that Tulkun verifies a real, large DC in less than 41 seconds while other tools need several minutes or up to tens of hours, and shows an up to 2355× speed up on 80% quantile of incremental verification with small overheads on commodity network devices.

 Abstract:  Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is an essential tool for network practitioners. Unfortunately, existing DES simulators cannot achieve satisfactory performance at the scale of modern networks. Recent work has attempted to address these challenges by reducing the traffic processed via novel approximation techniques; however, we argue in this paper that much of the slowdown of existing DES simulators is due to their underlying software architecture. Using ideas from high-throughput simulation of virtual worlds in gaming, this paper presents a fundamental redesign of DES network simulator, DONS, that marries domain-specific aspects of packetlevel network simulation with recent advances in data-oriented design. DONS can automatically parallelize simulation within and across servers to achieve high core utilization, low cache miss rate, and high memory efficiency. On a relatively weak ARM-based laptop (MacBook Air (M1, 2020)), DONS can simulate one second of a 100 Gbps, 1024-server data center in 22 minutes (a speedup of 21× compared to OMNeT++). On a cluster of CPU-based servers, DONS can achieve a speedup of 65×, matching the order of magnitude of recent GPU-accelerated deep learning performance estimators, but without any loss of accuracy.

 Abstract:  It is notoriously difficult to verify that a network is behaving as intended, especially at scale. This paper presents Hydra, a system that uses ideas from runtime verification to check that every packet is correctly processed with respect to a specification in real time. We propose a domain-specific language for writing properties, called Indus and we develop a compiler that turns properties thus specified into executable P4 code that runs alongside the forwarding code at line rate. To evaluate our approach, we used Indus to model a range of properties, showing that it is expressive enough to capture examples studied in prior work. We also deployed Hydra checkers for validating paths in source routing and for enforcing slice isolation in Aether, an open-source cellular platform. We confirmed a subtle bug in Aether’s 5G mobile core that would have been hard to detect using static techniques. We also evaluated the overheads of Hydra on hardware, finding that it does not significantly increase latency and often does not require additional pipeline stages.

  NetClone: Fast, Scalable, and Dynamic Request Cloning for Microsecond-Scale RPCs  
  Artifacts Available   Artifacts Evaluated - Functional   
 Gyuyeong Kim ( Sungshin Women's University  ) 

 Abstract:  Spawning duplicate requests, called cloning, is a powerful technique to reduce tail latency by masking service-time variability. However, traditional client-based cloning is static and harmful to performance under high load, while a recent coordinator-based approach is slow and not scalable. Both approaches are insufficient to serve modern microsecond-scale Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs). To this end, we present NetClone, a request cloning system that performs cloning decisions dynamically within nanoseconds at scale. Rather than the client or the coordinator, NetClone performs request cloning in the network switch by leveraging the capability of programmable switch ASICs. Specifically, NetClone replicates requests based on server states and blocks redundant responses using request fingerprints in the switch data plane. To realize the idea while satisfying the strict hardware constraints, we address several technical challenges when designing a custom switch data plane. NetClone can be integrated with emerging in-network request schedulers like RackSched. We implement a NetClone prototype with an Intel Tofino switch and a cluster of commodity servers. Our experimental results show that NetClone can improve the tail latency of microsecond-scale RPCs for synthetic and real-world application workloads and is robust to various system conditions. 
  BMW Tree: Large-scale, High-throughput and Modular PIFO Implementation using Balanced Multi-Way Sorting Tree

 Abstract:  Push-In-First-Out (PIFO) queue has been extensively studied as a programmable scheduler. To achieve accurate, large-scale, and high-throughput PIFO implementation, we propose the Balanced Multi-way (BMW) Sorting Tree for real-time packet sorting. The tree is highly modularized, insertion-balanced and pipeline-friendly with autonomous nodes. | Based on it, we design two simple and efficient hardware designs. The first one is a register-based (R-BMW) scheme. With a pipeline, it features an impressively high and stable throughput without any frequency reduction theoretically even under more levels. We then propose Ranking Processing Units to drive the BMW-Tree (RPU-BMW) to improve the scalability, where nodes are stored in SRAMs and dynamically loaded into/off from RPUs. As the capacity of BMW-Tree grows exponentially, only a few RPUs are needed for a large scale. | The evaluation shows that when deployed on the Xilinx Alveo U200 card, R-BMW improves the throughput by 4.8x compared to the original PIFO implementation, while exhibiting a similar capacity. RPU-BMW is synthesized in GlobalFoundries 28nm process, costing a modest 0.522% (1.043mm 2  ) chip area and 0.57MB off-chip memory to support 87k flows at 200Mpps. To our best knowledge, RPU-BMW is the first accurate PIFO implementation supporting over 80k flows at as fast as 200Mpps. 
  BitSense: Universal and Nearly Zero-Error Optimization for Sketch Counters with Compressive Sensing  
  Artifacts Available   Artifacts Evaluated - Functional   
 Rui Ding, Shibo Yang, Xiang Chen, Qun Huang ( Peking University  ) 

 Abstract:  Sketch algorithms have been widely deployed for network measurement as they achieve high accuracy with restricted resource usage. They store measurement results compactly in fixed-size counters. However, as sketch counters are skewed towards low values, higher bits in most counters remain zero. Such massive unused bits impair the space efficiency valued by sketch algorithms. Unfortunately, efforts to mitigate the issue either apply to specific algorithms or compromise accuracy. In this paper, we design BitSense, a novel optimization framework that integrates with existing sketch algorithms. The key idea is to regard higher bits in sketch counters as a sparse vector and leverage compressive sensing techniques to compress and restore counters. Further, BitSense provides a programming model to help developers easily realize sketch algorithms without dealing with the details of compression and recovery. BitSense proposes an automatic approach for parameter configuration. It theoretically guarantees nearly zero error under the configuration. We have built a BitSense prototype in P4 and a software platform and integrated it with fourteen sketch solutions. Extensive experiments show that BitSense significantly reduces the memory usage of existing sketch solutions by 25%-80% while incurring little overhead and almost zero accuracy drop, outperforming five state-of-the-art optimization frameworks.

 Guangda Sun, Mingliang Jiang, Xin Zhe Khooi, Yunfan Li, Jialin Li ( National University of Singapore  ) 

 Abstract:  Mission critical systems deployed in data centers today are facing more sophisticated failures. Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) protocols are capable of masking these types of failures, but are rarely deployed due to their performance cost and complexity. In this work, we propose a new approach to designing high performance BFT protocols in data centers. By re-examining the ordering responsibility between the network and the BFT protocol, we advocate a new abstraction offered by the data center network infrastructure. Concretely, we design a new authenticated ordered multicast primitive (AOM) that provides transferable authentication and non-equivocation guarantees. Feasibility of the design is demonstrated by two hardware implementations of AOM – one using HMAC and the other using public key cryptography for authentication – on new-generation programmable switches. We then co-design a new BFT protocol, NeoBFT, that leverages the guarantees of AOM to eliminate cross-replica coordination and authentication in the common case. Evaluation results show that NeoBFT outperforms state-of-the-art protocols on both latency and throughput metrics by a wide margin, demonstrating the benefit of our new network ordering abstraction for BFT systems.

 Abstract:  To mitigate IPv4 exhaustion, IPv6 provides expanded address space, and NAT allows a single public IPv4 address to suffice for many devices assigned private IPv4 address space. Even though NAT has greatly extended the shelf-life of IPv4, some networks need more private IPv4 space than what is officially allocated by IANA due to their size and/or network management practices. Some of these networks resort to using squat space, a term the network operations community uses for large public IPv4 address blocks allocated to organizations but historically never announced to the Internet. While squatting of IP addresses is an open secret, it introduces ethical, legal, and technical problems. In this work we examine billions of traceroutes to identify thousands of organizations squatting. We examine how they are using it and what happened when the US Department of Defense suddenly started announcing what had traditionally been squat space. In addition to shining light on a dirty secret of operational practices, our paper shows that squatting distorts common Internet measurement methodologies, which we argue have to be re-examined to account for squat space. 
  The Packet Number Space Debate in Multipath QUIC  
  
 Quentin De Coninck ( UCLouvain  ) 

 Abstract:  With a standardization process that attracted much interest, QUIC can been seen as the next general-purpose transport protocol. Still, it does not provide true multipath support yet, missing some use cases that Multipath TCP addresses. To fill that gap, the IETF recently adopted a Multipath proposal merging several proposed designs. While it focuses on its core components, there still remains one major design issue: the amount of packet number spaces that should be used. This paper provides experimental results with two different Multipath QUIC implementations based on NS3 simulations to understand the impact of using one packet number space per path or a single packet number space for the whole connection. Our results show that using one packet number space per path makes Multipath QUIC more resilient to the receiver's heuristics to acknowledge packets and detect duplicates.

  Computers Can Learn from the Heuristic Designs and Master Internet Congestion Control  
  Artifacts Available   
 Chen-Yu Yen ( New York University  ), Soheil Abbasloo ( University of Toronto  ), H. Jonathan Chao ( New York University  ) 

 Abstract:  In this work, for the first time, we demonstrate that computers can automatically learn from observing the heuristic efforts of the last four decades, stand on the shoulders of the existing Internet congestion control (CC) schemes, and discover a better-performing one. To that end, we address many different practical challenges, from how to generalize representation of various existing CC schemes to serious challenges regarding learning from a vast pool of policies in the complex CC domain and introduce Sage. Sage is the first purely data-driven Internet CC design that learns a better scheme by harnessing the existing solutions. We compare Sage's performance with the state-of-the-art CC schemes through extensive evaluations on the Internet and in controlled environments. The results indicate that Sage has learned a better-performing policy. While there are still many unanswered questions, we hope our data-driven framework can pave the way for a more sustainable design strategy. 
  Host Congestion Control  
  
 Saksham Agarwal ( Cornell University  ), Arvind Krishnamurthy ( Google/University of Washington  ), Rachit Agarwal ( Cornell University  ) 

 Abstract:  The conventional wisdom in systems and networking communities is that congestion happens primarily within the network fabric. However, adoption of high-bandwidth access links and relatively stagnant technology trends for resources within hosts have led to emergence of host congestion—that is, congestion within the host network that enables data exchange between NIC and CPU/memory. Such host congestion alters the many assumptions entrenched within decades of research and practice of congestion control. | We present hostCC, a congestion control architecture to handle both host and network fabric congestion. hostCC embodies three key ideas. First, in addition to congestion signals that originate within the network fabric, hostCC collects host congestion signals that capture the precise time, location, and reason for host congestion. Second, hostCC introduces a sub-RTT granularity host-local congestion response that uses congestion signals to allocate host resources between network traffic and host-local traffic. Finally, hostCC uses both host and network congestion signals to allocate network resources at an RTT granularity. | We realize hostCC within the Linux network stack. Our hostCC implementation requires no modifications in applications, host hardware, and/or network hardware; moreover, it can be integrated with existing congestion control protocols to handle both host and network fabric congestion. Evaluation of Linux DCTCP with and without hostCC suggests that, in the presence of host congestion, hostCC significantly reduces queueing and packet drops at the host, resulting in improved performance of networked applications in terms of throughput and tail latency.

 Abstract:  Packet loss due to link corruption is a major problem in large warehouse-scale datacenters. The current state-of-the-art approach of disabling corrupting links is not adequate because, in practice, all the corrupting links cannot be disabled due to capacity constraints. In this paper, we show that, it is feasible to implement link-local retransmission at sub-RTT timescales to completely mask corruption packet losses from the transport endpoints. Our system, LinkGuardian, employs a range of techniques to (i) keep the packet buffer requirement low, (ii) recover from tail packet losses without employing timeouts, and (iii) preserve packet ordering. We implement LinkGuardian on the Intel Tofino switch and show that for a 100G link with a loss rate of 10 −3  , LinkGuardian can reduce the loss rate by up to 6 orders of magnitude while incurring only 8% reduction in effective link speed. By eliminating tail packet losses, LinkGuardian improves the 99.9th percentile flow completion time (FCT) for TCP and RDMA by 51x and 66x respectively. Finally, we also show that in the context of datacenter networks, simple out-of-order retransmission is often sufficient to significantly mitigate the impact of corruption packet loss for short TCP flows. 
  Augmented Queue: A Scalable In-Network Abstraction for Data Center Network Sharing  
  
 Xinyu Crystal Wu, Zhuang Wang, Weitao Wang, T. S. Eugene Ng ( Rice University  ) 

 Abstract:  Traffic aggregates in cloud data center networks are by and large buffered and transmitted by simple physical FIFO queues. Despite the crucial role they play, a well-known problem of physical FIFO queues is that they are unable to provide precise bandwidth guarantees. This leads to a range of negative impacts spanning the application layer, the transport layer, and the data link layer. | In this paper, we address this problem with Augmented Queue (AQ), a scalable in-network abstraction that provides precise bandwidth guarantees for traffic constituents. AQ serves multiple valuable use cases in data center networks. For example, AQ facilitates the isolation of traffic from different applications; ensures that different congestion control algorithms can properly co-exist; and enforces inbound and outbound bandwidth for virtual machines. We demonstrate via testbed and simulation experiments that AQ can provide precise bandwidth guarantees and scale to millions of traffic constituents.

 Abstract:  The rising demand for WAN capacity driven by the rapid growth of inter-data center traffic poses new challenges for costly optical networks. Today, cloud providers rely on fixed optical backbones, where all hardware devices operate on a rigid spectrum grid, leading to the waste of expensive optical resources and subpar performance in handling failures. In this paper, we introduce FlexWAN, a novel flexible WAN infrastructure designed to provision cost-effective WAN capacity while ensuring resilience to optical failures. FlexWAN achieves this by incorporating spacing-variable hardware at the optical layer, enabling the generated wavelength to optimize the utilization of limited spectrum resources for WAN capacity. The configuration of spacing-variable hardware in a multi-vendor optical backbone presents challenges related to spectrum management. To address this, FlexWAN leverages a centralized controller to achieve the coordinated control of network-wide optical devices in a vendor-agnostic manner. Moreover, the flexibility at the optical layer introduces new algorithmic problems. FlexWAN formulates the problem of provisioning WAN capacity with the goal of minimizing hardware costs. We evaluate the system performance in production and share insights from years of production experience. Compared to the existing optical backbone, FlexWAN can save at least 57% of transponders and reduce 36% of spectrum usage while continuing to meet up to 8× the present-day demands using existing hardware and fiber deployments. FlexWAN further incorporates failure resilience that revives 15% more bandwidth capacity in the overloaded optical backbone 
  Hose-based cross-layer backbone network design with Benders decomposition

 Abstract:  Network design is the process of dimensioning IP capacity over an optical network infrastructure to satisfy a given set of demands and reliability constraints. Specifically, we consider the problem of hose-based cross-layer network design, which seeks to find a minimum cost design that is able to route demand for all hose traffic matrices under all specified failure states. While most network design problems are solved as Mixed Integer Programs, a commercial solver can become intractable due to the scale of today's networks. We demonstrate how the classic Benders decomposition algorithm can be applied and improved for this problem and discuss practical implementation aspects. We showcase a horizontally scalable distributed framework to leverage the decomposable problem structure and solve millions of linear programs in a distributed manner, thereby making the network design problem tractable. In contrast to the conventional approach where failure states and traffic matrices are planned sequentially, the Benders algorithm finds global optimal designs across all traffic matrices and failure states. This leads to network designs with improved solution quality and reliability, with 20-30% less IP capacity and spectrum consumption, 50% less link augments and up to 20x faster runtime that enables design for hyper scale networks in a matter of hours.

 Abstract:  We present the design, implementation, evaluation, deployment and production experiences of EBB (Express BackBone), a private WAN (Wide Area Network) connecting Meta's global data centers (DCs). Initiated in 2015, EBB now carries 100% of DC-DC traffic, witnessing remarkable growth over the years. A key design aspect of EBB is its multi-plane architecture, facilitating seamless deployment of a new control plane while ensuring operational simplicity. This architecture allows for efficient failure mitigation, standard maintenance, and capacity expansion by draining one or two planes without impacting service level objectives (SLOs). Another critical design decision is the hybrid model, combining distributed control agents and a central controller. EBB's centralized traffic engineering utilizes an MPLS-TE based solution to allocate paths periodically for different traffic classes based on service requirements, while its distributed control agents enable fast local failure recovery by pre-installing pre-computed backup paths in the data plane. We delve into our eight-year production experience, highlighting the successful deployment of multiple generations of EBB. 
  PAINTER: Ingress Traffic Engineering and Routing for Enterprise Cloud Networks

 Abstract:  Enterprises increasingly use public cloud services for critical business needs. However, Internet protocols force clouds to choose between high availability and performance, reducing the speed at which clouds can respond to network problems, the range of solutions they can provide, and deployment resilience. To overcome this limitation, we present PAINTER, a system that takes control over which routes are available and which are chosen to the cloud by leveraging edge proxies. PAINTER efficiently advertises BGP prefixes, exposing more concurrent routes than existing solutions to improve latency and resilience. Compared to existing solutions, PAINTER reduces path inflation by 75% while using a third of the prefixes of other solutions, avoids 20% more path failures, and chooses ingresses from the edge at finer time (RTT) and traffic (per-flow) granularities, enhancing our agility.

 Abstract:  The rapid expansion of global cloud wide-area networks (WANs) has posed a challenge for commercial optimization engines to efficiently solve network traffic engineering (TE) problems at scale. Existing acceleration strategies decompose TE optimization into concurrent subproblems but realize limited parallelism due to an inherent tradeoff between run time and allocation performance. | We present Teal, a learning-based TE algorithm that leverages the parallel processing power of GPUs to accelerate TE control. First, Teal designs a flow-centric graph neural network (GNN) to capture WAN connectivity and network flows, learning flow features as inputs to downstream allocation. Second, to reduce the problem scale and make learning tractable, Teal employs a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to independently allocate each traffic demand while optimizing a central TE objective. Finally, Teal fine-tunes allocations with ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers), a highly parallelizable optimization algorithm for reducing constraint violations such as overutilized links. | We evaluate Teal using traffic matrices from Microsoft's WAN. On a large WAN topology with >1,700 nodes, Teal generates near-optimal flow allocations while running several orders of magnitude faster than the production optimization engine. Compared with other TE acceleration schemes, Teal satisfies 6–32% more traffic demand and yields 197–625× speedups.

 Abstract:  We describe our experience with Fathom, a system for identifying the network performance bottlenecks of any service running in the Google fleet. Fathom passively samples RPCs, the principal unit of work for services. It segments the overall latency into host and network components with kernel and RPC stack instrumentation. It records these detailed latency metrics, along with detailed transport connection state, for every sampled RPC. This lets us determine if the completion is constrained by the client, network or server. To scale while enabling analysis, we also aggregate samples into distributions that retain multi-dimensional breakdowns. This provides us with a macroscopic view of individual services. Fathom runs globally in our datacenters for all production traffic, where it monitors billions of TCP connections 24x7. For several years Fathom has been our primary tool for troubleshooting service network issues and assessing network infrastructure changes. We present case studies to show how it has helped us improve our production services.

 Abstract:  Serverless computing provides fine-grained  resource elasticity for data analytics—a job can flexibly scale its resources for each  stage instead of sticking to a fixed pool of resources throughout  its lifetime. Due to different data dependencies and different shuffling overheads caused by intra- and inter-server communication, the best degree of parallelism (DoP) for each stage varies based on runtime conditions. | We present Ditto, a job scheduler for serverless analytics that leverages fine-grained resource elasticity to optimize for job completion time (JCT) and cost. The key idea of Ditto is to use a new scheduling granularity— stage group  —to decouple parallelism configuration from function placement. Ditto bundles stages into stage groups based on their data dependencies and IO characteristics. It exploits the parallelized time characteristics of the stages to determine the parallelism configuration, and prioritizes the placement of stage groups with large shuffling traffic, so that the stages in these groups can leverage zero-copy intra-server communication for efficient shuffling. We build a system prototype of Ditto and evaluate it with a variety of benchmarking workloads. Experimental results show that Ditto outperforms existing solutions by up to 2.5× on JCT and up to 1.8× on cost.

 Abstract:  Microservices are becoming more complicated, posing new challenges for traditional performance monitoring solutions. On the one hand, the rapid evolution of microservices places a significant burden on the utilization and maintenance of existing distributed tracing frameworks. On the other hand, complex infrastructure increases the probability of network performance problems and creates more blind spots on the network side. In this paper, we present DeepFlow, a network-centric distributed tracing framework for troubleshooting microservices. DeepFlow provides out-of-the-box tracing via a network-centric tracing plane and implicit context propagation. In addition, it eliminates blind spots in network infrastructure, captures network metrics in a low-cost way, and enhances correlation between different components and layers. We demonstrate analytically and empirically that DeepFlow is capable of locating microservice performance anomalies with negligible overhead. DeepFlow has already identified over 71 critical performance anomalies for more than 26 companies and has been utilized by hundreds of individual developers. Our production evaluations demonstrate that DeepFlow is able to save users hours of instrumentation efforts and reduce troubleshooting time from several hours to just a few minutes.

 Abstract:  Modern cloud-based applications have complex inter-dependencies on both distributed application components as well as network infrastructure, making it difficult to reason about their performance. As a result, a rich body of work seeks to automate performance diagnosis of enterprise networks and such cloud applications. However, existing methods either ignore inter-dependencies which results in poor accuracy, or require causal acyclic dependencies which cannot model common enterprise environments | We describe the design and implementation of Murphy, an automated performance diagnosis system, that can work with commonly available telemetry in practical enterprise environments, while achieving high accuracy. Murphy utilizes loosely-defined associations between entities obtained from commonly available monitoring data. Its learning algorithm is based on a Markov Random Field (MRF) that can take advantage of such loose associations to reason about how entities affect each other in the context of a specific incident. We evaluate Murphy in an emulated microservice environment and in real incidents from a large enterprise. Compared to past work, Murphy is able to reduce diagnosis error by ≈ 1.35× in restrictive environments supported by past work, and by ≥ 4.7× in more general environments.

  Lightning: A Reconfigurable Photonic-Electronic SmartNIC for Fast and Energy-Efficient Inference  
  Artifacts Available   Artifacts Evaluated - Functional

 Abstract:  The massive growth of machine learning-based applications and the end of Moore's law have created a pressing need to redesign computing platforms. We propose Lightning, the first reconfigurable photonic-electronic smartNIC to serve real-time deep neural network inference requests. Lightning uses a fast datapath to feed traffic from the NIC into the photonic domain without creating digital packet processing and data movement bottlenecks. To do so, Lightning leverages a novel reconfigurable count-action abstraction that keeps track of the required computation operations of each inference packet. Our count-action abstraction decouples the compute control plane from the data plane by counting the number of operations in each task and triggers the execution of the next task(s) without interrupting the dataflow. We evaluate Lightning's performance using four platforms: a prototype, chip synthesis, emulations, and simulations. Our prototype demonstrates the feasibility of performing 8-bit photonic multiply-accumulate operations with 99.25% accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, our prototype is the highest-frequency photonic computing system, capable of serving real-time inference queries at 4.055 GHz end-to-end. Our simulations with large DNN models show that compared to Nvidia A100 GPU, A100X DPU, and Brainwave smartNIC, Lightning accelerates the average inference serve time by 337x, 329x, and 42x, while consuming 352x, 419x, and 54x less energy, respectively. 
  AdaInf: Data Drift Adaptive Scheduling for Accurate and SLO-guaranteed Multiple-Model Inference Serving at Edge Servers  
  
 Sudipta Saha Shubha, Haiying Shen ( University of Virginia  ) 

 Abstract:  Various audio and video applications rely on deep neural network (DNN) models deployed on edge servers to conduct inference with ms-level latency service-level-objectives (SLOs). The scale of the applications has been increasingly growing with multiple DNN models incorporated into one application. Accuracy drop from data drift requires conducting both continual retraining and inference serving for multi-model applications in an edge server, which introduces a challenge on GPU resource allocation to satisfy the tight SLOs and meanwhile achieve high accuracy in this scenario. However, there has been no research devoted to tackling this challenge. In this paper, we first conducted trace-based experimental analysis, which shows that different models have different impact degrees from data drift, incremental retraining (proposed by us that retrains certain samples before inference) helps increase accuracy, and etc. By leveraging the observations, we propose a data drift Adaptive scheduler for accurate and SLO-guaranteed Inference serving at edge servers (AdaInf). AdaInf uses incremental retraining. It allocates GPU amount among applications based on their SLOs, and for each application, further splits GPU time between retraining and inference to satisfy its SLO, and then allocates GPU time among retraining tasks based on their impact degrees. Besides, AdaInf has strategies to reduce the influence of CPU-GPU memory communications on latency. Our real trace-driven experimental evaluation shows that AdaInf increases up to 21% accuracy and reduces up to 54% SLO violations compared to the existing methods, and takes 2ms scheduling time. Achieving similar accuracy as AdaInf requires 4× more GPU resources on the edge server for the existing method. 
  Janus: A Unified Distributed Training Framework for Sparse Mixture-of-Experts Models  
  
 Juncai Liu ( Tsinghua University  ), Jessie Hui Wang ( Tsinghua University and Zhongguancun Laboratory  ), Yimin Jiang ( bytedance  ) 

 Abstract:  Scaling models to large sizes to improve performance has led a trend in deep learning, and sparsely activated Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) is a promising architecture to scale models. However, training MoE models in existing systems is expensive, mainly due to the All-to-All communication between layers. | All-to-All communication originates from expert-centric  paradigm: keeping experts in-place and exchanging intermediate data to feed experts. We propose the novel data-centric  paradigm: keeping data in-place and moving experts between GPUs. Since experts' size can be smaller than the size of data, data-centric paradigm can reduce communication workload. Based on this insight, we develop Janus. First, Janus supports fine-grained asynchronous communication, which can overlap computation and communication. Janus implements a hierarchical communication to further reduce cross-node traffic by sharing the fetched experts in the same machine. Second, when scheduling the ``fetching expert'' requests, Janus implements a topology-aware priority strategy to utilize intra-node and inter-node links efficiently. Finally, Janus allows experts to be prefetched, which allows the downstream computation to start immediately once the previous step completes. | Evaluated on a 32-A100 cluster, Janus can reduce the traffic up to 16× and achieves up to 2.06× speedup compared with current MoE training system. 
  Lightwave Fabrics: At-Scale Optical Circuit Switching for Datacenter and Machine Learning Systems

 Abstract:  We describe our experience developing what we believe to be the world’s first large-scale production deployments of lightwave fabrics used for both datacenter networking and machine-learning (ML) applications. Using optical circuit switches (OCSes) and optical transceivers developed in-house, we employ hardware and software codesign to integrate the fabrics into our network and computing infrastructure. Key to our design is a high degree of multiplexing enabled by new kinds of wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) and optical circulators that support high-bandwidth bidirectional traffic on a single strand of optical fiber. The development of the requisite OCS and optical transceiver technologies leads to a synchronous lightwave fabric that is reconfigurable, low latency, rate agnostic, and highly available. These fabrics have provided substantial benefits for long-lived traffic patterns in our datacenter networks and predictable traffic patterns in tightly-coupled machine learning clusters. We report results for a large-scale ML superpod with 4096 tensor processing unit (TPU) V4 chips that has more than one ExaFLOP of computing power. For this use case, the deployment of a lightwave fabric provides up to 3× better system availability and model-dependent performance improvements of up to 3.3× compared to a static fabric, despite constituting less than 6% of the total system cost.

  Dragonfly: Higher Perceptual Quality For Continuous 360° Video Playback  
  Artifacts Available   Artifacts Evaluated - Functional

 Abstract:  When streaming 360° video, it is possible to reduce bandwidth by 5× with approaches that spatially segment video into tiles and only stream the user’s viewport. Unfortunately, it is difficult to accurately predict a user’s viewport even 2-3 seconds before playback. This results in rebuffering events owing to misprediction of a user’s viewport or network bandwidth dips, which hurts interactive experience. However, avoiding rebuffering by naively skipping tiles that do not arrive by the playback deadline may lead to incomplete viewports and degraded experience. | In this paper, we describe Dragonfly, a new 360° system that preserves interactive experience by avoiding playback stalls while maintaining high perceptual quality. Dragonfly prudently skips tiles using a model that defines an overall utility function to decide which tiles to fetch, and at which qualities they should be fetched, with the goal of optimizing user experience. To minimize incomplete viewports, it also fetches a low quality masking stream. Using a user study with 26 users and emulation-based experiments we show that Dragonfly has higher quality, and lower overheads, than state-of-the-art 360° streaming approaches. For instance, in our study, 65% of sessions have a rating of 4 or higher (Good/Excellent) with Dragonfly, while only 16% of sessions with Pano, and 13% of sessions with Flare achieve this rating. 
  Ekho: Synchronizing Cloud Gaming Media Across Multiple Endpoints  
  
 Pouya Hamadanian ( MIT  ), Doug Gallatin ( Microsoft  ), Mohammad Alizadeh ( MIT  ), Krishna Chintalapudi ( Microsoft Research  ) 

 Abstract:  Online cloud gaming platforms stream game media to multiple endpoints (e.g., a television display and a controller-connected headset) via possibly different networks with considerably different latencies. This leads to the media being played out of sync with one another, and severely degrades user experience. Typical approaches that rely on network and software timing measurements fail to reach synchronization goals. In this work, we propose Ekho  , a robust and efficient end-to-end approach for synchronizing streams transmitted to two devices. Ekho adds faint, human-inaudible pseudo-noise (PN) markers to the game audio, and listens for these markers in the chat audio captured by the player's microphone to measure inter-stream delay (ISD). The game server then compensates for the ISD to synchronize the streams. We evaluate Ekho in depth, with a corpus of audio samples from popular online games, and demonstrate that it calculates ISD with sub-millisecond accuracy, has low computational overhead, and is resilient to background chatter, compression and microphone quality. In end-to-end tests over WiFi and cellular links with frequent packet loss and playback disruption, Ekho maintains human-imperceptible ISD (< 10 ms) 86.8% of the time. Without Ekho, the ISD exceeds 50 ms at all times.

 Abstract:  We consider the problem of hosting financial exchanges in the cloud. Exchanges necessitate strong fairness guarantees for competing participants, particularly for use cases such as "high frequency trading". Today, exchanges achieve such guarantees by providing equal latency across all market participants in their on-premise deployments. However, ensuring equal latency for fairness is notably challenging in current multi-tenant cloud deployments, mainly due to factors such as network congestion and non-equidistant network paths. | In this paper, we address the problem of unfairness stemming from unpredictable and unbounded network latency in cloud networks. Taking inspiration from the use of logical clocks in distributed systems, we present Delivery Based Ordering (DBO), a novel mechanism that guarantees fairness by post-hoc offsetting the latency differences among market participants in the cloud. We thoroughly evaluate DBO in simulation, a bare-metal testbed and a public cloud deployment, and we demonstrate that it is feasible to guarantee fairness while operating at high transaction rates with a sub-100μs end-to-end latency.

 Abstract:  Shuffle is one of the most expensive communication primitives in distributed data processing and is difficult to scale. Prior work addresses the scalability challenges of shuffle by building monolithic shuffle systems. These systems are costly to develop, and they are tightly integrated with batch processing frameworks that offer only high-level APIs such as SQL. New applications, such as ML training, require more flexibility and finer-grained interoperability with shuffle. They are often unable to leverage existing shuffle optimizations. | We propose an extensible shuffle architecture. We present LibShuffle, a library for distributed shuffle that offers competitive performance and scalability as well as greater flexibility than monolithic shuffle systems. We design an architecture that decouples the shuffle control plane from the data plane without sacrificing performance. We build LibShuffle on Ray, a distributed futures system for data and ML applications, and demonstrate that we can: (1) rewrite previous shuffle optimizations as application-level libraries with an order of magnitude less code, (2) achieve shuffle performance and scalability competitive with monolithic shuffle systems, and break the CloudSort record as the world's most cost-efficient sorting system, and (3) enable new applications such as ML training to easily leverage scalable shuffle.

 Abstract:  Digital equity in Internet access is often measured along three axes: availability, affordability, and adoption. Most prior work focuses on availability; the other two aspects have received little attention. In this paper, we study broadband affordability in the US. Specifically, we focus on the nature of broadband plans offered by major ISPs across the US. To this end, we develop a broadband plan querying tool (BQT) that obtains broadband plans (upload/download speed and price) offered by seven major ISPs for any street address in the US. We then use this tool to curate a dataset, querying broadband plans for over 837 k street addresses in thirty cities for seven major wireline broadband ISPs. We use a plan's carriage value, the Mbps of a user's traffic that an ISP carries for one dollar, to compare plans. Our analysis provides us with the following new insights: (1) ISP plans vary inter-city. Specifically, the fraction of census block groups that receive high and low carriage value plans varies widely by city; (2) ISP plans intra-city are spatially clustered, and the carriage value can vary as much as 600% within a city; (3) Cable-based ISPs offer up to 30% more carriage value to users when competing with fiber-based ISPs in a block group; and (4) Average income in a block group plays a critical role in dictating who gets a fiber deployment (i.e., a better carriage value) in the US. While we hope our tool, dataset, and analysis in their current form are helpful for policymakers at different levels (city, county, state), they are only a small step toward understanding digital equity. Based on our learnings, we conclude with recommendations to continue to advance our understanding of broadband affordability.

 Abstract:  Today’s Web remains too expensive for many Internet users, especially in developing regions. Unfortunately, the rising complexity of the Web makes affordability an even bigger concern as it stands to limit users’ access to Internet services. We propose a novel framework and a fairness metric for rethinking Web architecture for affordability and inclusion. Our proposed framework systematically adapts Web complexity based on geographic variations in mobile broadband prices and income levels. We conduct a cross-country analysis of 99 countries, showing that our framework can better balance affordability and webpage quality while preserving user privacy. To adapt Web complexity, our framework solves an optimization problem to produce webpages that maximize page quality while reducing the webpage to a given target size.

 Abstract:  In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive longitudinal analysis of government-ordered Internet shutdowns and spontaneous outages (i.e., disruptions not ordered by the government). We describe the available tools, data sources and methods to identify and analyze Internet shutdowns. We then merge manually curated datasets on known government-ordered shutdowns and large-scale Internet outages, further augmenting them with data on real-world events, macroeconomic and sociopolitical indicators, and network operator statistics. Our analysis confirms previous findings on the economic and political profiles of countries with government-ordered shutdowns. Extending this analysis, we find that countries with national-scale spontaneous outages often have profiles similar to countries with shutdowns, differing from countries that experience neither. However, we find that government-ordered shutdowns are many more times likely to occur on days of mobilization, coinciding with elections, protests, and coups. Our study also characterizes the temporal characteristics of Internet shutdowns and finds that they differ significantly in terms of duration, recurrence interval, and start times when compared to spontaneous outages.

 Abstract:  In-network devices around the world monitor and tamper with connections for many reasons, including intrusion prevention, combating spam or phishing, and country-level censorship. Connection tampering seeks to block access to specific domain names or keywords, and it affects billions of users worldwide with little-to-no transparency. To detect, diagnose, and measure connection-level blocking, "active" measurement techniques originate queries with domains or keywords believed to be blocked and send them from vantage points within networks of interest. Active measurement efforts have been critical to understanding how traffic tampering occurs, but they inherently are unable to capture critical parts of the picture. For instance, knowing the set of domains in a block-list (i.e., what *could* get blocked) is not the same as knowing what real users are actively experiencing (i.e., what is *actively* getting blocked). | We present the first global study of connection tampering through a *passive* analysis of traffic received at a global CDN, Cloudflare. We analyze a sample of traffic to all of Cloudflare's servers to construct the first comprehensive list of *tampering signatures*: sequences of packet headers that are indicative of connection tampering. We then apply these tampering signatures to analyze our global dataset of real user traffic, yielding a more comprehensive view of connection tampering than has been possible with active measurements alone. In particular, our passive analysis allows us to report on how connection tampering is actively affecting users and clients from virtually every network, without active probes, vantage points in difficult-to-reach networks and regions, or test lists (which we analyze for completeness against our results). Our study shows that passive measurement can be a powerful complement to active measurement in understanding connection tampering and improving transparency.

  Converge: QoE-driven Multipath Video Conferencing over WebRTC  
  
 Sandesh Dhawaskar Sathyanarayana ( University of Colorado Boulder  ), Kyunghan Lee ( Seoul National University  ), Dirk Grunwald, Sangtae Ha ( University of Colorado Boulder  ) 

 Abstract:  Video conferencing has become a daily necessity, but protocols to support video conferencing have yet to keep pace despite the innovation in next-generation networks. As video resolutions increase and mobile applications using multiple cameras for photos and videos become popular, the need to meet the Quality of Experience (QoE) requirements is growing. Multipath protocols could be a possible solution. | In this paper, we show that a straightforward extension of WebRTC for supporting multipath can perform worse than legacy WebRTC and propose CONVERGE, a WebRTC-compliant multipath video conferencing platform. CONVERGE improves QoE through three main components: a video-aware scheduler, video QoE feedback, and video-aware and path-specific packet protection. The video-aware scheduler uses the real-time video structure to schedule packets, and the video QoE feedback from the receiver helps the scheduler adjust the number of packets on each path. Additionally, the video-aware and path-specific packet protection mechanism improves on the existing FEC mechanism in WebRTC by considering the trade-off between FEC and QoE. CONVERGE is built as part of the Chromium browser, making it compatible with any device or network path. CONVERGE improves overall media throughput by 1.2×, reduces end-to-end latency by 20%, and enhances image quality by 55% compared to WebRTC.

 Abstract:  In cellular networks, there is a growing adoption of virtualized radio access networks (vRANs), where operators are replacing the traditional specialized hardware for RAN processing with software running on commodity servers. Today's vRAN deployments lack resilience, since there is no support for vRAN failover or upgrades without long service interruptions. Enabling these features for vRANs is challenging because of their strict real-time latency requirements and black-box nature. Slingshot is a new system that transparently provides resilience for the vRAN's most performance-critical layer: the physical layer (PHY). We design new techniques for realtime workload migration with fast RAN protocol middleboxes, and realtime RAN failure detection. A key insight in our design is to view the transient disruptions from resilience events to RAN computation state and I/O similarly to regular wireless signal impairments, and leverage the inherent resilience of cellular networks to these events. Experiments with a state-of-the-art 5G vRAN testbed show that Slingshot handles PHY failover with no disruption to video conferencing, and under 110ms of disruption to a TCP connection, and it also enables zero-downtime upgrades.

 Abstract:  This paper presents CellFusion, a system designed for high-quality, real-time video streaming from vehicles to the cloud. It leverages an innovative blend of multipath QUIC transport and network coding. Surpassing the limitations of individual cellular carriers, CellFusion uses a unique last-mile overlay that integrates multiple cellular networks into a single, unified cloud connection. This integration is made possible through the use of in-vehicle Customer Premises Equipment (CPEs) and edge-cloud proxy servers. | In order to effectively handle unstable cellular connections prone to intense burst losses and unexpected latency spikes as a vehicle moves, CellFusion introduces XNC. This innovative network coding-based transport solution enables efficient and resilient multipath transport. XNC aims to accomplish low latency, minimal traffic redundancy, and reduced computational complexity all at once. CellFusion is secure and transparent by nature and does not require modifications for vehicular apps connecting to it. | We tested CellFusion on 100 self-driving vehicles for over six months with our cloud-native back-end running on 50 CDN PoPs. Through extensive road tests, we show that XNC reduced video packet delay by 71.53% at the 99th percentile versus 5G. At 30Mbps, CellFusion achieved 66.11% ∼ 80.62% reduction in video stall ratio versus state-of-the-art multipath transport solutions with less than 10% traffic redundancy. 
  Improving Network Availability with Protective ReRoute

 Abstract:  We present PRR (Protective ReRoute), a transport technique for shortening user-visible outages that complements routing repair. It can be added to any transport to provide benefits in multipath networks. PRR responds to flow connectivity failure signals, e.g., retransmission timeouts, by changing the FlowLabel on packets of the flow, which causes switches and hosts to choose a different path that may avoid the outage. To enable it, we shifted our IPv6 network architecture to use the FlowLabel, so that hosts can select paths for their flows transparently to applications. PRR is deployed fleetwide at Google for TCP and Pony Express, where it has been protecting all production traffic for several years. It is also available to our Cloud customers. We find it highly effective for real outages. In a measurement study on our network backbones, adding PRR reduced the cumulative region-pair outage time for RPC traffic by 63-84%. This is the equivalent of adding 0.4–0.8 "nines" of availability.

 Abstract:  Quality and cost are two key considerations for video conferencing services. Video conferencing providers face a dilemma when selecting network tiers  to build their infrastructure—relying on Internet links has poor video conferencing quality, while using premium links brings excessive cost. | We present XRON, a hybrid elastic cloud overlay network for our planetary-scale video conferencing service. XRON differs from prior overlay networks with two distinct features. First, XRON is a hybrid overlay that leverages both Internet links and premium links to achieve both  high quality and low cost. Second, XRON exploits elastic cloud resources to adaptively scale its capacity based on realtime demand. The data plane of XRON combines active probing and passive tracking for scalable link state monitoring, uses asymmetric forwarding based on heterogeneous bidirectional link qualities, and quickly reacts to sudden link degradations without the control plane involvement. The control plane of XRON predicts video traffic based on application knowledge and computes global forwarding paths and reaction plans with scalable algorithms. Large-scale production deployment shows that XRON reduces video stall ratio and bad audio fluency by 77% and 65.2%, respectively, compared to using Internet links only, and reduces cost by 4.73×, compared to using premium links only.

  ZGaming: Zero-Latency 3D Cloud Gaming by Image Prediction  
  
 Jiangkai Wu, Yu Guan ( Peking University  ), Qi Mao ( Communication University of China  ), Yong Cui ( Tsinghua University  ), Zongming Guo, Xinggong Zhang ( Peking University  ) 

 Abstract:  In cloud gaming, interactive latency is one of the most important factors in users' experience. Although the interactive latency can be reduced through typical network infrastructures like edge caching and congestion control, the interactive latency of current cloud-gaming platforms is still far from users' satisfaction. This paper presents ZGaming, a novel 3D cloud gaming system based on image prediction, in order to eliminate the interactive latency in traditional cloud gaming systems. To improve the quality of the predicted images, we propose (1) a quality-driven 3D-block cache to reduce the "hole" artifacts, (2) a server-assisted LSTM-predicting algorithm to improve the prediction accuracy of dynamic foreground objects, and (3) a prediction-performance-driven adaptive bitrate strategy which optimizes the quality of predicted images. The experiment on the real-world cloud gaming network conditions shows that compared with existing methods, ZGaming reduces the interactive latency from 23 ms to 0 ms when providing the same video quality, or improves the video quality by 5.4 dB when keeping the interactive latency as 0 ms. 
  PacketGame: Multi-Stream Packet Gating for Concurrent Video Inference at Scale  
  
 Mu Yuan, Lan Zhang, Xuanke You, Xiang-Yang Li ( University of Science and Technology of China  ) 

 Abstract:  The resource efficiency of video analytics workloads is critical for large-scale deployments on edge nodes and cloud clusters. Recent advanced systems have benefited from techniques including video compression, frame filtering, and deep model acceleration. However, based on our year-long experience of operating a real-time video analytics system on more than 1000 cameras, we identified a previously overlooked bottleneck of end-to-end concurrency: video decoding. To support concurrent video inference at scale, in this work, we investigate a new task, named video packet gating, which selectively filters packets before running a decoder. We propose a novel multi-view embedding approach for video packets and present PacketGame that has both theoretical performance guarantee and practical system designs. Experiments on both public datasets and a real system show PacketGame saves 52.0-79.3% decoding costs and achieves 2.1-4.8× concurrency compared to original workloads.

 Abstract:  In this paper, we consider the task of answering what-if questions in the context of adaptive bit rate (ABR) video streaming without access to randomized control trials (RCTs) (e.g., no A/B testing) – i.e., given recorded data of an existing deployed system, what would be the performance impact if we changed its design. Our work makes three contributions. First, we show the problem is challenging since data may only be available for a single ABR algorithm without RCTs, and since it is necessary to deal with the cascading effects that past ABR decisions have on future decisions. Next we present Veritas, the first framework that tackles causal reasoning for video streaming without requiring data collected through RCTs. Integral to Veritas is an easy-to-interpret domain-specific ML model that relates the latent stochastic process (intrinsic bandwidth that the video session can achieve) to actual observations (download times), while exploiting counterfactual queries via abduction using the observed TCP states (e.g., congestion window) for blocking the cascading dependencies. Third, we evaluate Veritas’s ability to accurately answer a wide range of what-if questions using emulation experiments, and data of real video sessions from Puffer. The results show that (i) Veritas accurately tackles a wider range of what-if questions (e.g., change of buffer size or video quality) that existing approaches cannot; (ii) Veritas without RCT training data achieves performance comparable or better than a recent parallel approach that requires RCT data; and (iii) in many scenarios Veritas achieves accuracy close to an ideal oracle.

 Abstract:  On-demand streaming video traffic is managed by an adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithm whose job is to optimize quality of experience (QoE) for a single video session. ABR algorithms leave the question of sharing network resources up to transport-layer algorithms. We observe that as the internet gets faster relative to video streaming rates, this delegation of responsibility gives video traffic a burstier on-off traffic pattern. In this paper, we show we can substantially smooth video traffic to improve its interactions with the rest of the internet, while maintaining the same or better QoE for streaming video. We smooth video traffic with two design principles: application-informed pacing, which allows ABR algorithms to set an upper limit on packet-by-packet throughput, and by designing ABR algorithms that work with pacing. We propose a joint ABR and rate-control scheme, called Sammy, which selects both video quality and pacing rates. We implement our scheme and evaluate it at a large video streaming service. Our approach smooths video, making it a more friendly neighbor to other internet applications. One surprising result is that it requires no compromise for the video traffic: in large scale, production experiments, Sammy improves video QoE over an existing, finely-tuned production ABR algorithm.

 Abstract:  Cloud computing has witnessed tremendous growth, prompting enterprises to migrate to the cloud for reliable and on-demand computing. Within a single Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), the number of instances (such as VMs, bare metals, and containers) has reached millions, posing challenges related to supporting millions of instances with network location decoupling from the underlying hardware, high elastic performance, and high reliability. However, academic studies have primarily focused on specific issues like high-speed data plane and virtualized routing infrastructure, while existing industrial network technologies fail to adequately address these challenges. | In this paper, we report on the design and experience of Achelous  , Alibaba Cloud’s network virtualization platform. Achelous  consists of three key designs to enhance hyperscale VPC: (i) a novel hierarchical programming architecture based on the collaborative design of both data plane and control plane; (ii) elastic performance strategy and distributed ECMP schemes for seamless scale-up and scale-out, respectively; (iii) health check scheme and transparent VM live migration mechanisms that ensure stateful flow continuity during the failover. The evaluation results demonstrate that, Achelous  scales to over 1,500,000 of VMs with elastic network capacity in a single VPC, and reduces 25× programming time, with 99% updating can be completed within 1 second. For failover, it condenses 22.5× downtime during VM live migration, and ensures 99.99% of applications do not experience stall. More importantly, the experience from three years of operation proves the Achelous  's serviceability, and versatility independent of any specific hardware platforms.

 Abstract:  This paper presents the design, implementation, evaluation, and deployment of Meta's production network migration system. We first introduce the network migration problem for large-scale production datacenter networks (DCNs). A network migration task at Meta touches as many as hundreds of switches and tens of thousands of circuits per datacenter, and involves physical deployment work on site that can last months. We describe real-world migration challenges, covering complex and evolving DCN architectures and operational constraints. We mathematically formalize the problem of generating efficient and safe migration plans, and exploit the inherent symmetry and locality of DCN topologies to prune the search space. We design an ordering-agnostic compact topology representation to eliminate redundant satisfiability checking, and apply the A* algorithm with a domain-specific priority function to find the optimal  plan. Evaluation results on a range of production migration cases show that Klotski reduces the time to find optimal migration plans by up to 381× compared to prior solutions. We hope by introducing the problem and sharing our deployment experience, this work can provide a useful context for network migration in the real world and inspire future research.

 Abstract:  In-Network Computing (INC) has found many applications for performance boosts or cost reduction. However, given heterogeneous devices, diverse applications, and multi-path network typologies, it is cumbersome and error-prone for application developers to effectively utilize the available network resources and gain predictable benefits without impeding normal network functions. Previous work is oriented to network operators more than application developers. We develop ClickINC to streamline the INC programming and deployment using a unified and automated workflow. ClickINC provides INC developers a modular programming abstractions, without concerning to the states of the devices and the network topology. We describe the ClickINC framework, model, language, workflow, and corresponding algorithms. Experiments on both an emulator and a prototype system demonstrate its feasibility and benefits.

 Abstract:  Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) is widely used in high-performance computing (HPC) and data center networks. In this paper, we first show that RDMA does not work well with existing load balancing algorithms because of its traffic flow characteristics and assumption of in-order packet delivery. We then propose ConWeave, a load balancing framework designed for RDMA. The key idea of ConWeave is that with the right design, it is possible to perform fine granularity rerouting and mask the effect of out-of-order packet arrivals transparently in the network datapath using a programmable switch. We have implemented ConWeave on a Tofino2 switch. Evaluations show that ConWeave can achieve up to 42.3% and 66.8% improvement for average and 99-percentile FCT, respectively compared to the state-of-the-art load balancing algorithms.

 Abstract:  Fine-grained network telemetry is becoming a modern datacenter standard and is the basis of essential applications such as congestion control, load balancing, and advanced troubleshooting. As network size increases and telemetry gets more fine-grained, there is a tremendous growth in the amount of data needed to be reported from switches to collectors to enable network-wide view. As a consequence, it is progressively hard to scale data collection systems. | We introduce Direct Telemetry Access (DTA), a solution optimized for aggregating and moving hundreds of millions of reports per second from switches into queryable data structures in collectors’ memory. DTA is lightweight and it is able to greatly reduce overheads at collectors. DTA is built on top of RDMA, and we propose novel and expressive reporting primitives to allow easy integration with existing state-of-the-art telemetry mechanisms such as INT or Marple. | We show that DTA significantly improves telemetry collection rates. For example, when used with INT, it can collect and aggregate over 400M reports per second with a single server, improving over the Atomic MultiLog by up to 16x. 
  GGFAST: Automating Generation of Flexible Network Traffic Classifiers

 Abstract:  When employing supervised machine learning to analyze network traffic, the heart of the task often lies in developing effective features for the ML to leverage. We develop GGFAST, a unified, automated framework that can build powerful classifiers for specific network traffic analysis tasks, built on interpretable features. The framework uses only packet sizes, directionality, and sequencing, facilitating analysis in a payload-agnostic fashion that remains applicable in the presence of encryption. GGFAST analyzes labeled network data to identify n-grams (“snippets”) in a network flow’s sequence-of-message-lengths that are strongly indicative of given categories of activity. The framework then produces a classifier that, given new (unlabeled) network data, identifies the activity to associate with each flow by assessing the presence (or absence) of snippets relevant to the different categories. We demonstrate the power of our framework by building—without any case-specific tuning—highly accurate analyzers for multiple types of network analysis problems. These span traffic classification (L7 protocol identification), finding DNS-over-HTTPS in TLS flows, and identifying specific RDP and SSH authentication methods. Finally, we demonstrate how, given ciphersuite specifics, we can transform a GGFAST analyzer developed for a given type of traffic to automatically detect instances of that activity when tunneled within SSH or TLS. 
  OmniWindow: A General and Efficient Window Mechanism Framework for Network Telemetry  
  Artifacts Available   
 Haifeng Sun, Jiaheng Li, Jintao He, Jie Gui, Qun Huang ( Peking University  ) 

 Abstract:  Recent network telemetry solutions typically target programmable switches to achieve high performance and in-network visibility. They partition the packet stream into windows and then apply various stream processing techniques to summarize flow-level statistics. However, existing studies focus on the measurement within each window. Window management is still a missing piece due to the resource limitation of programmable switches. In this paper, we propose OmniWindow, a general and efficient window mechanism framework. OmniWindow splits the original window into fine-grained sub-windows such that the sub-windows can be merged into various window types. To deal with the resource restriction, OmniWindow carefully designs its data plane memory layout and proposes a window synchronization method. It also employs a collaborative architecture that can collect and reset stateful data in sub-windows within a limited time. We prototype OmniWindow on Tofino. We incorporate OmniWindow into a SOTA query-driven telemetry system and eight sketch-based telemetry algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that OmniWindow enables these telemetry solutions to achieve higher accuracy than conventional window mechanism. 
  ChameleMon: Shifting Measurement Attention as Network State Changes

 Abstract:  Network measurement is critical to many network applications. There are mainly two kinds of flow-level measurement tasks: 1) packet accumulation tasks and 2) packet loss tasks. In practice, the two kinds of tasks are often required at the same time, but existing works seldom handle both. In this paper, we design ChameleMon to support the two kinds of tasks simultaneously. The key design of ChameleMon is to shift measurement attention as network state changes, through two dimensions of dynamics: 1) dynamically allocating memory between the two kinds of tasks; 2) dynamically monitoring the flows of importance. To realize the key design, we propose a key technique, leveraging Fermat’s little theorem to devise a flexible data structure, namely FermatSketch. FermatSketch is dividable, additive, and subtractive, supporting the two kinds of tasks. We have implemented a ChameleMon prototype on a testbed with a Fat-tree topology. We conduct extensive experiments and the results show ChameleMon supports the two kinds of tasks with low memory/bandwidth overhead, and more importantly, it can automatically shift measurement attention as network state changes.

  IPv6 Hitlists at Scale: Be Careful What You Wish For  
  Artifacts Available   
 Erik Rye, Dave Levin ( University of Maryland  ) 

 Abstract:  Today's network measurements rely heavily on Internet-wide scanning, using tools like ZMap that are capable of quickly iterating over the entire IPv4 address space. Unfortunately, IPv6's vast address space poses an existential threat for Internet-wide scans and traditional network measurement techniques. To address this reality, efforts are underway to develop "hitlists" of known-active IPv6 addresses to reduce the search space for would-be scanners. As a result, there is an inexorable push for constructing as large and complete a hitlist as possible. | This paper asks: what are the potential benefits and harms when IPv6 hitlists grow larger? To answer this question, we obtain the largest IPv6 active-address list to date: 7.9 billion addresses, 898 times larger than the current state-of-the-art hitlist. Although our list is not comprehensive, it is a significant step forward and provides a glimpse into the type of analyses possible with more complete hitlists. | We compare our dataset to prior IPv6 hitlists and show both benefits and dangers. The benefits include improved insight into client devices (prior datasets consist primarily of routers), outage detection, IPv6 roll-out, previously unknown aliased networks, and address assignment strategies. The dangers, unfortunately, are severe: we expose widespread instances of addresses that permit user tracking and device geolocation, and a dearth of firewalls in home networks. We discuss ethics and security guidelines to ensure a safe path towards more complete hitlists. 
  Regional IP Anycast: Deployments, Performance, and Potentials

 Abstract:  Recent studies show that an end system’s traffic may reach a faraway anycast site in a global IP anycast system, resulting in high latency. To address this issue, some private and public CDNs have implemented regional IP anycast. This approach involves dividing content-hosting sites into geographic regions, announcing a unique IP anycast prefix for each region, and utilizing DNS and IP-geolocation to direct clients to a CDN site in their corresponding geographic area. In this work, we aim to understand how a regional anycast CDN partitions its sites and maps its customers’ clients, and how a regional anycast CDN performs compared to its global anycast counterpart. We study the deployment strategies and the performance of two CDNs (Edgio and Imperva) that currently deploy regional IP anycast. We find that both Edgio and Imperva partition their sites and clients following continent or country borders. Furthermore, we compare the client latency distribution in Imperva’s regional anycast CDN with its similar-scale DNS global anycast network, while accounting for and mitigating the relevant deployment differences between the two networks. We find that regional anycast can effectively alleviate the pathology in global IP anycast where BGP routes a client’s traffic to a distant CDN site. However, DNS mapping inefficiencies, where DNS returns a sub-optimal regional IP anycast address that does not cover a client’s low-latency CDN sites, can harm regional anycast’s performance. Finally, using the Tangled testbed, we demonstrate the performance benefits of regional IP anycast using a latency-based region partition method. The results show that the 90th percentile client latency is reduced by 58.7% to 78.6% for clients in various geographic areas when compared to a global anycast configuration.

 Abstract:  Despite the preeminent importance of DNS, numerous new attacks and vulnerabilities are regularly discovered. The root of the problem is the ambiguity and tremendous complexity of DNS protocol specifications, amid a rapidly evolving Internet infrastructure. To counteract the vicious break-and-fix cycle for improving DNS infrastructure, we instigate a foundational approach: we construct the first formal semantics of end-to-end name resolution, a collection of components for the formal analyses of both qualitative and quantitative properties, and an automated tool for discovering new DoS attacks. Our formal framework represents an important step towards a substantially more secure and reliable DNS infrastructure.

 Abstract:  Relying party validator is a critical component of RPKI: it fetches and validates signed authorizations mapping prefixes to their owners. Routers use this information to block bogus BGP routes. | Since the processing time of validators is not limited, malicious repositories could stall them. To limit the time that RPKI validators spend on downloading RPKI objects, thresholds were introduced into all popular implementations. | We perform the first analysis of the thresholds. On the one hand, we show that the current thresholds are too permissive and hence do not prevent attacks. On the other hand, we show that even those permissive thresholds cause 11.78% failure rate in validators. We find experimentally that although stricter thresholds would make attacks more difficult they would significantly increase the failure rates. Our analysis shows that no matter what balance between permissive-strict thresholds is struck, one of the problems, either failures or exposure to attacks, will always persist. | As a solution against attacks and failures we develop a sort-and-limit algorithm for validators. We demonstrate through extensive evaluations on a simulated platform that our algorithm prevents the attacks and failures not only in the current but also in full RPKI deployment.

 Abstract:  The data plane cache, a critical functionality found in numerous network devices, such as programmable switches, intelligent NICs, and DPUs, is often subject to limitations in its programmability and memory access capacity. As a result, the majority of existing data plane caches rely on simple and inefficient replacement policies. This paper is set to introduce LRU, a near-optimal replacement policy, into the programmable data plane. We first explore the reasons why the traditional implementation of LRU is not suitable for deployment on the data plane. Consequently, we propose P4LRU, a pipeline-optimized version of the LRU implementation. Building on P4LRU, we conceive three distinct in-network systems – LruTable, LruIndex, and LruMon, and successfully bring them to life on Tofino switches. Our thorough experimental trials establish that P4LRU provides a significant performance boost over existing data plane caches in these three systems. We have open-sourced the source codes for the three systems on GitHub.

 Abstract:  Cache management is critical for Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), impacting their performance and operational costs. Most production CDNs apply static, hand-tuned caching policy parameters at cache servers, such as admission frequency or size thresholds for the Hot Object Caches (HOC) of their system. However, these static policies fall short when a server is faced with unpredictable traffic pattern changes, even when policies employ multiple control parameters/knobs. Recent approaches have proposed learning-based solutions to dynamically adjust policy parameters, but they are limited in action space, caching objectives, or impose high overhead. We propose Darwin, a CDN cache management system that is robust to traffic pattern changes and can flexibly optimize different caching objectives with unrestricted action spaces. Darwin employs a three-stage pipeline involving traffic pattern feature collection, unsupervised clustering for classification, and neural bandit expert selection to choose the optimal caching policy. Through extensive simulations, experiments using an Apache Traffic Server (ATS)-based prototype, and theoretical analysis, we show that Darwin achieves significant performance gain w.r.t. different objectives such as maximizing object hit rates and minimizing disk writes, while simultaneously adapting to traffic pattern shifts. Darwin imposes negligible overhead and achieves high throughput compared to the state-of-the-art.

 Abstract:  Resource management is important for conferencing services (such as Microsoft Teams, Zoom) to ensure good user experience while keeping the costs low. Key to this is the efficient provisioning and assignment of media processing (MP) servers, which do the heavy lifting of mixing and redistributing the media streams from and to the call participants. We introduce Switchboard – a controller for efficient resource management for conferencing services. Switchboard is peakaware, recognizing that cost depends on the peak resource usage and that there is a temporal shift in peak demand across time zones. This allows a server in a region to serve calls at peak time, and double up as backup for other regions during non-peak times. Furthermore, it improves efficiency by performing joint network and compute provisioning and application aware provisioning. We evaluate Switchboard using 1+ year of records from Microsoft Teams. Switchboard achieves upto 51% lower provisioning cost while achieving similar or better latency over state-of-the-art baselines.

 Abstract:  The recent emergence of low-power high-throughput programmable storage platforms—SmartNIC JBOF (just-a-bunch-of-flash)—motivates us to rethink the cluster architecture and system stack for energy-efficient large-scale data-intensive workloads. Unlike conventional systems that use an array of server JBOFs or embedded storage nodes, the introduction of SmartNIC JBOFs has drastically changed the cluster compute, memory, and I/O configurations. Such an extremely imbalanced architecture makes prior system design philosophies and techniques either ineffective or invalid. | This paper presents LEED  , a distributed, replicated, and persistent key-value store over an array of SmartNIC JBOFs. Our key ideas to tackle the unique challenges induced by a SmartNIC JBOF are: trading excessive I/O bandwidth for scarce SmartNIC core computing cycles and memory capacity; making scheduling decisions as early as possible to streamline the request execution flow. LEED systematically revamps the software stack and proposes techniques across per-SSD, intra-JBOF, and inter-JBOF levels. Our prototyped system based on Broadcom Stingray outperforms existing solutions that use beefy server JBOFs and wimpy embedded storage nodes by 4.2×/3.8× and 17.5×/19.1× in terms of requests per Joule for 256B/1KB key-value objects.

 Abstract:  SmartNICs are on the rise as a packet processing platform, with the trend towards a uniform P4 programming model. However, unleashing SmartNIC packet processing performance in P4 is a formidable task. Traditional SmartNIC optimizations rely on low-level program tuning, but P4 abstractions operate at one level above. At the same time, today’s P4 optimizations primarily focus on resource packing rather than performance tuning. We develop Pipeleon, an automated performance optimization framework for P4 programmable SmartNICs. We introduce techniques that are tailored to the performance characteristics of SmartNICs, and further leverage dynamic workload patterns for profile-guided optimization. Pipeleon pinpoints program hotspots at the P4 level and computes runtime optimization plans to specialize the program layout based on the latest profile. We have prototyped Pipeleon and applied it to optimize two popular P4 SmartNICs—Nvidia BlueField2 and Netronome Agilio CX—as well as a software SmartNIC emulator extended based on BMv2. Our results show that Pipeleon significantly improves SmartNIC packet processing performance in realistic scenarios. 
  Memory Management in ActiveRMT: Towards Runtime-programmable Switches  
  Artifacts Available   
 Rajdeep Das, Alex C. Snoeren ( UC San Diego  ) 

 Abstract:  A wide variety of in-network services have been developed for RMT-based switching hardware, almost exclusively through the P4 language and ecosystem. Many of these applications maintain state in switch memory, a scarce shared resource. As with any other network resource, varying traffic demands necessitate reallocations, yet the P4 ecosystem is not well suited for dynamic resource management: Modifying the set of services deployed on a switch using P4 requires the network operator to prepare a new binary image and re-provision the switch, disrupting all existing traffic. We present an alternate approach—using techniques from capsule-based active networking—to programming RMT devices that enables non-disruptive (re)allocation of switch memory at time scales that are much faster than P4 compilation without operator intervention. We use P4 to implement a single, shared runtime on commodity RMT hardware that interprets instructions received via the switch data plane to deliver a variety of exemplar services including caching, load balancing, and network telemetry. Our prototype implementation is able to dynamically provision dozens-to-hundreds of instances of simultaneous stateful services at the timescale of seconds. 
  Cowbird: Freeing CPUs to Compute by Offloading the Disaggregation of Memory  
  Artifacts Available   
 Xinyi Chen, Liangcheng Yu, Vincent Liu ( University of Pennsylvania  ), Qizhen Zhang ( University of Toronto and Microsoft  ) 

 Abstract:  Memory disaggregation allows applications running on compute servers to expand their pool of available memory capacity by leveraging remote resources through low-latency networks. Unfortunately, in existing software-level disaggregation frameworks, the simple act of issuing requests to remote memory—paid on every access—can consume many CPU cycles. This overhead represents a direct cost to disaggregation, not only on the throughput of remote memory access but also on application logic, which must contend with the framework’s CPU overheads. In this paper, we present Cowbird, a memory disaggregation architecture that frees compute servers to fulfill their stated purpose by removing disaggregation-related logic from their CPUs. Our experimental evaluation shows that Cowbird eliminates disaggregation overhead on compute-server CPUs and can improve end-to-end performance by up to 3.5x compared to RDMA-only communication.

 Abstract:  Hardware offloaded network stacks are widely adopted in modern datacenters to meet the demand for high throughput, ultra-low latency and low CPU overhead. To fully leverage their exceptional performance, users need to have a deep understanding of their behaviors. Despite many efforts on testing software network stacks, hardware network stacks impose unique challenges to testing tools due to their kernel bypass nature and high performance. | In this paper, we present Lumina, a tool to test the correctness and performance of hardware network stacks. Lumina leverages network programmability to emulate various network scenarios at line rate. With user-friendly interfaces, Lumina enables developers to inject deterministic events, thus facilitating the development of precise and reproducible tests. Given the limited resource and flexibility of programmable network devices, we mirror all the packets to dedicated servers and dump them for offline analysis. We leverage Lumina to test four RDMA NICs from NVIDIA and Intel, and identify bugs that can significantly degrade performance or mislead network operations. Lumina also enables us to capture unexpected micro-behaviors which are missing or not clearly described in public documents and specifications. Vendors have confirmed the critical bugs we discovered and will include bug fixes in future releases.

 17th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems  
 Singapore, 18th-22nd September 2023  
 The ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys) is the premier international forum for the presentation of new research results, systems and techniques in the broad field of recommender systems. RecSys brings together the major international research groups working on recommender systems, along with many of the world’s leading companies active in e-commerce and other adjacent domains. It has become the most important annual conference for the presentation and discussion of recommender systems research. RecSys 2023, the seventeenth conference in this series, will be held in Singapore. It will bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to present their latest results and identify new trends and challenges in providing recommendation components in a range of innovative application contexts. In addition to the main technical track, the RecSys 2023 program will feature keynote and invited talks, tutorials covering state-of-the-art in this domain, a workshop program, an industrial track and a doctoral symposium.  

 Statement on Inclusion and Safety  
 As the organizers of RecSys 2023, we are committed to providing an inclusive, safe, and respectful conference environment for all attendees. As we increasingly realize the impact of our community’s work on society, we appreciate now more than ever the importance of providing an inclusive and accessible conference that brings together a diverse recommender systems community.  
  As an ACM conference, RecSys and its organizers, speakers, and attendees are bound by the ACM Policy Against Discrimination and Harassment  , which applies to both the conference venue and social media. As organizers, this is a policy that we fully endorse.  
  RecSys has made efforts over the last several years to be an accessible and inclusive community, across various perspectives, and we have sought throughout our planning of RecSys 2023 to continue and expand those efforts. The General Chairs (Shlomo Berkovsky, Li Chen and Jie Zhang) welcome your input  
 Accessibility and Inclusion at RecSys.  The RecSys conference values and cares about diversity, accessibility and inclusion. We have always been diverse in terms of disciplinary backgrounds (e.g. including both HCI- and data-focused work), professional affiliations (e.g. strong representation from both academia and industry), and application domains of our work. We are aware that members in our community may come from historically underrepresented groups, for which we wish to pro-actively encourage and support increased participation. To ensure the conference and its activities are accessible to all, we also explicitly seek to address the visible or invisible support needs members of our community may have.  
 Publications and Presentations.  RecSys hosts a variety of scientific discussions. Historically, we have prepared guidelines for accessible and inclusive presentations. We would like to emphasize that inclusive, safe and respectful addressing does not only apply to conference presentations, but also to the whole process leading towards these presentations, including the way in which research is presented and reviewed. We therefore would like to encourage our community members to already keep our best practice guidelines on inclusive language in mind, when preparing their manuscripts and peer reviewing.  
 Contact.  Should you experience or witness a violation of the anti-harassment policy, or have any other concerns regarding your ability to fully and safely participate in the conference, please email the RecSys General Chairs; you can also directly reach them at the conference venue.  
 We hope you have an amazing RecSys.

 RES  A Lightweight Method for Modeling Confidence in Recommendations with Learned Beta Distributions  
  by Norman Knyazev (Radboud University) and Harrie Oosterhuis (Radboud University). | Most recommender systems (RecSys) do not provide an indication of confidence in their decisions. Therefore, they do not distinguish between recommendations of which they are certain, and those where they are not. Existing confidence methods for RecSys are either inaccurate heuristics, conceptually complex or very computationally expensive. Consequently, real-world RecSys applications rarely adopt these methods, and thus, provide no confidence insights in their behavior. In this work, we propose learned beta distributions (LBD) as a simple and practical recommendation method with an explicit measure of confidence. Our main insight is that beta distributions predict user preferences as probability distributions that naturally model confidence on a closed interval, yet can be implemented with the minimal model-complexity. Our results show that LBD maintains competitive accuracy to existing methods while also having a significantly stronger correlation between its accuracy and confidence. Furthermore, LBD has higher performance when applied to a high-precision targeted recommendation task. Our work thus shows that confidence in RecSys is possible without sacrificing simplicity or accuracy, and without introducing heavy computational complexity. Thereby, we hope it enables better insight into real-world RecSys and opens the door for novel future applications.

  RES  A Multi-view Graph Contrastive Learning Framework for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation  
  by Zitao Xu (Shenzhen University), Weike Pan (Shenzhen University) and Zhong Ming (Shenzhen University). | Sequential recommendation methods play an irreplaceable role in recommender systems which can capture the users’ dynamic preferences from the behavior sequences. Despite their success, these works usually suffer from the sparsity problem commonly existed in real applications. Cross-domain sequential recommendation aims to alleviate this problem by introducing relatively richer source-domain data. However, most existing methods capture the users’ preferences independently of each domain, which may neglect the item transition patterns across sequences from different domains, i.e., a user’s interaction in one domain may influence his/her next interaction in other domains. Moreover, the data sparsity problem still exists since some items in the target and source domains are interacted with only a limited number of times. To address these issues, in this paper we propose a generic framework named multi-view graph contrastive learning (MGCL). Specifically, we adopt the contrastive mechanism in an intra-domain item representation view and an inter-domain user preference view. The former is to jointly learn the dynamic sequential information in the user sequence graph and the static collaborative information in the cross-domain global graph, while the latter is to capture the complementary information of the user’s preferences from different domains. Extensive empirical studies on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our MGCL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

  RES  Adversarial Collaborative Filtering for Free  
  by Huiyuan Chen (Visa Research), Xiaoting Li (Visa Research), Vivian Lai (Visa Research), Chin-Chia Michael Yeh (Visa Research), Yujie Fan (Visa Research), Yan Zheng (Visa Research), Mahashweta Das (Visa Research) and Hao Yang (Visa Research). | Collaborative Filtering (CF) has been successfully applied to help users discover the items of interest. Nevertheless, existing CF methods suffer from noisy data issue, which negatively impacts the quality of personalized recommendation. To tackle this problem, many prior studies leverage the adversarial learning principle to regularize the representations of users and items, which has shown great ability in improving both generalizability and robustness. Generally, those methods learn adversarial perturbations and model parameters using min-max optimization framework. However, there still have two major limitations: 1) Existing methods lack theoretical guarantees of why adding perturbations improve the model generalizability and robustness since noisy data is naturally different from adversarial attacks; 2) Solving min-max optimization is time-consuming. In addition to updating the model parameters, each iteration requires additional computations to update the perturbations, making them not scalable for industry-scale datasets.  
 In this paper, we present Sharpness-aware Matrix Factorization (SharpMF), a simple yet effective method that conducts adversarial training without extra computational cost over the base optimizer. To achieve this goal, we first revisit the existing adversarial collaborative filtering and discuss its connection with recent Sharpness-aware Minimization. This analysis shows that adversarial training actually seeks model parameters that lie in neighborhoods having uniformly low loss values, resulting in better generalizability. To reduce the computational overhead, SharpMF introduces a novel trajectory loss to measure sharpness between current weights and past weights. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our SharpMF achieves superior performance with almost zero additional computational cost comparing to adversarial training.

  RES  Alleviating the Long-Tail Problem in Conversational Recommender Systems  
  by Zhipeng Zhao (Singapore Management University), Kun Zhou (School of Information, Renmin University of China), Xiaolei Wang (Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China), Wayne Xin Zhao (Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China), Fan Pan (Poisson Lab, Huawei), Zhao Cao (Poisson Lab, Huawei) and Ji-Rong Wen (Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China). | Conversational recommender systems (CRS) aim to provide the recommendation service via natural language conversations. To develop an effective CRS, high-quality CRS datasets are very crucial. However, existing CRS datasets suffer from the long-tail issue, \ie a large proportion of items are rarely (or even never) mentioned in the conversations, which are called long-tail items. As a result, the CRSs trained on these datasets tend to recommend frequent items, and the diversity of the recommended items would be largely reduced, making users easier to get bored.  
 To address this issue, this paper presents \textbf{LOT-CRS}, a novel framework that focuses on simulating and utilizing a balanced CRS dataset (\ie covering all the items evenly) for improving \textbf{LO}ng-\textbf{T}ail recommendation performance of CRSs. In our approach, we design two pre-training tasks to enhance the understanding of simulated conversation for long-tail items, and adopt retrieval-augmented fine-tuning with label smoothness strategy to further improve the recommendation of long-tail items. Extensive experiments on two public CRS datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness and extensibility of our approach, especially on long-tail recommendation. All the experimental codes will be released after the review period.

  RES  Augmented Negative Sampling for Collaborative Filtering  
  by Yuhan Zhao (Harbin Engineering University), Rui Chen (Harbin Engineering University), Riwei Lai (Harbin Engineering University), Qilong Han (Harbin Engineering University), Hongtao Song (Harbin Engineering University) and Li Chen (Hong Kong Baptist University). | Negative sampling is essential for implicit-feedback-based collaborative filtering, which is used to constitute negative signals from massive unlabeled data to guide supervised learning. The state-of-the-art idea is to utilize hard negative samples that carry more useful information to form a better decision boundary. To balance efficiency and effectiveness, the vast majority of existing methods follow the two-pass approach, in which the first pass samples a fixed number of unobserved items by a simple static distribution and then the second pass selects the final negative items using a more sophisticated negative sampling strategy. However, selecting negative samples from the original items from a dataset is inherently limited due to the limited available choices, and thus may not be able to contrast positive samples well. In this paper, we confirm this observation via carefully designed experiments and introduce two major limitations of existing solutions: ambiguous trap and information discrimination.  
 Our response to such limitations is to introduce “augmented” negative samples that may not exist in the original dataset. This direction renders a substantial technical challenge because constructing unconstrained negative samples may introduce excessive noise that eventually distorts the decision boundary. To this end, we introduce a novel generic augmented negative sampling (ANS) paradigm and provide a concrete instantiation. First, we disentangle the hard and easy factors of negative items. Next, we generate new candidate negative samples by augmenting only the easy factors in a regulated manner: the direction and magnitude of the augmentation are carefully calibrated. Finally, we design an advanced negative sampling strategy to identify the final augmented negative samples, which considers not only the score used in existing methods but also a new metric called augmentation gain. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ANS-Recbole-B070/.

  RES  AutoOpt: Automatic Hyperparameter Scheduling and Optimization for Deep Click-through Rate Prediction  
  by Yujun Li (Noah’s Ark Lab), Xing Tang (Noah’s Ark Lab), Bo Chen (Noah’s Ark Lab), Yimin Huang (Noah’s Ark Lab), Ruiming Tang (Noah’s Ark Lab) and Zhenguo Li (Noah’s Ark Lab). | Click-through Rate (CTR) prediction is essential for commercial recommender systems. Recently, to improve the prediction accuracy, plenty of deep learning-based CTR models have been proposed, which are sensitive to hyperparameters and difficult to optimize well. General hyperparameter optimization methods fix these hyperparameters across the entire model training and repeat them multiple times. This trial-and-error process not only leads to suboptimal performance but also requires non-trivial computation efforts. In this paper, we propose an automatic hyperparameters scheduling and optimization method for deep CTR models, \emph{AutoOpt}, making the optimization process more stable and efficient. Specifically, the whole training regime is firstly divided into several consecutive stages, where a data-efficient model is learned to model the relation between model states and prediction performance. To optimize the stage-wise hyperparameters, AutoOpt uses the \textit{global} and \textit{local} scheduling modules to propose proper hyperparameters for the next stage based on the training in the current stage. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks are conducted to validate the effectiveness of AutoOpt. Moreover, AutoOpt has been deployed onto an advertising platform and a music platform, where online A/B tests also demonstrate superior improvement.

  RES  BVAE: Behavior-aware Variational Autoencoder for Multi-Behavior Multi-Task Recommendation  
  by Qianzhen Rao (Shenzhen University), Yang Liu (Shenzhen University), Weike Pan (Shenzhen University) and Zhong Ming (Shenzhen University). | A practical recommender system should be able to handle heterogeneous behavioral feedback as inputs and has multi-task outputs ability. Although the heterogeneous one-class collaborative filtering (HOCCF) and multi-task learning (MTL) methods has been well studied, there is still a lack of targeted manner in their combined fields, i.e., Multi-behavior Multi-task Recommendation (MMR). To fill the gap, we propose a novel recommendation framework called Behavior-aware Variational AutoEncoder (BVAE), which meliorates the parameter sharing and loss minimization method with the VAE structure to address the MMR problem. Specifically, our BVAE includes address behavior-aware semi-encoders and decoders, and a target feature fusion network with a global feature filtering network, while using standard deviation to weigh loss. These modules generate the behavior-aware recommended item list via constructing better semantic feature vectors for users, i.e., from dual perspectives of behavioral preference and global interaction. In addition, we optimize our BVAE in terms of adaptability and robustness, i.e., it is concise and flexible to consume any amount of behaviors with different distributions. Extensive empirical studies on two real and widely used datasets confirm the validity of our design and show that our BVAE can outperform the state-of-the-art related baseline methods under multiple evaluation metrics.

  RES  Contrastive Learning with Frequency-Domain Interest Trends for Sequential Recommendation  
  by Yichi Zhang (Harbin Engineering University), Guisheng Yin (Harbin Engineering University) and Yuxin Dong (Harbin Engineering University). | Recently, contrastive learning for sequential recommendation has demonstrated its powerful ability to learn high-quality user representations. However, constructing augmented samples in the time domain poses challenges due to various reasons, such as fast-evolving trends, interest shifts, and system factors. Furthermore, the F-principle indicates that deep learning preferentially fits the low-frequency part, resulting in poor performance on high-frequency tasks. The complexity of time series and the low-frequency preference limit the utility of sequence encoders. To address these challenges, we need to construct augmented samples from the frequency domain, thus improving the ability to accommodate events of different frequency sizes. To this end, we propose a novel Contrastive Learning with Frequency-Domain Interest Trends for Sequential Recommendation (CFIT4SRec). We treat the embedding representations of historical interactions as “images” and introduce the second-order Fourier transform to construct augmented samples. The components of different frequency sizes reflect the interest trends between attributes and their surroundings in the hidden space. We introduce three data augmentation operations to accommodate events of different frequency sizes: low-pass augmentation, high-pass augmentation, and band-stop augmentation. Extensive experiments on four public benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of CFIT4SRec over the state-of-the-art baselines. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/zhangyichi1Z/CFIT4SRec.

  RES  Correcting for Interference in Experiments: A Case Study at Douyin  
  by Vivek Farias (MIT), Hao Li (Bytedance), Tianyi Peng (MIT), Xinyuyang Ren (Bytedance), Huawei Zhang (Bytedance) and Andrew Zheng (MIT). | Interference is a ubiquitous problem in experiments conducted on two-sided content marketplaces, such as Douyin (China’s analog of TikTok). In many cases, creators are the natural unit of experimentation, but creators interfere with each other through competition for viewers’ limited time and attention. “Naive” estimators currently used in practice simply ignore the interference, but in doing so incur bias on the order of the treatment effect. We formalize the problem of inference in such experiments as one of policy evaluation. Off-policy estimators, while unbiased, are impractically high variance. We introduce a novel Monte-Carlo estimator, based on “Differences-in-Qs” (DQ) techniques, which achieves bias which is second-order in the treatment effect, while remaining sample-efficient to estimate. On the theoretical side, our contribution is to develop a generalized theory of Taylor expansions for policy evaluation, which extends DQ theory to all major MDP formulations. On the practical side, we implement our estimator on Douyin’s experimentation platform, and in the process develop DQ into a truly “plug-and-play” estimator for interference in real-world settings: one which provides robust, low-bias, low-variance treatment effect estimates; admits computationally cheap, asymptotically exact uncertainty quantification; and reduces MSE by 99\% compared to the best existing alternatives in our applications.

  RES  Data-free Knowledge Distillation for Reusing Recommendation Models  
  by Cheng Wang (Huazhong University of Science and Technology), Jiacheng Sun (Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab), Zhenhua Dong (Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab), Jieming Zhu (Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab), Zhenguo Li (Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab), Ruixuan Li (Huazhong University of Science and Technology) and Rui Zhang (ruizhang.info). | A common practice to keep the freshness of an offline Recommender System (RS) is to train models that fit the user’s most recent behaviours while directly replacing the outdated historical model. However, many feature engineering and computing resources are used to train these historical models, but they are underutilized in the downstream RS model training. In this paper, to turn these historical models into treasures, we introduce a model inversed data synthesis framework, which can recover training data information from the historical model and use it for knowledge transfer. This framework synthesizes a new form of data from the historical model. Specifically, we ‘invert’ an off-the-shield pretrained model to synthesize binary class user-item pairs beginning from random noise without requiring any additional information from the training dataset. To synthesize new data from a pretrained model, we update the input from random float initialization rather than one- or multi-hot vectors. An additional statistical regularization is added to further improve the quality of the synthetic data inverted from the deep model with batch normalization. The experimental results show that our framework can generalize across different types of models. We can efficiently train different types of classical Click-Through-Rate (CTR) prediction models from scratch with significantly few inversed synthetic data (2 orders of magnitude). Moreover, our framework can also work well in the knowledge transfer scenarios such as continual updating and data-free knowledge distillation.

Except for the interacted items, user behaviors contain rich interaction information, such as the behavior type, time, location, etc. However, so far, the information related to user behaviors has not yet been fully exploited. In the paper, we propose the concept of a situation and situational features for distinguishing interaction behaviors and then design a CTR model named Deep Situation-Aware Interaction Network (DSAIN). DSAIN first adopts the reparameterization trick to reduce noise in the original user behavior sequences. Then it learns the embeddings of situational features by feature embedding parameterization and tri-directional correlation fusion. Finally, it obtains the embedding of behavior sequence via heterogeneous situation aggregation. We conduct extensive offline experiments on three real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DSAIN model. More importantly, DSAIN has increased the CTR by 2.70\%, the CPM by 2.62\%, and the GMV by 2.16\% in the online A/B test. Now, DSAIN has been deployed on the Meituan food delivery platform and serves the main traffic of the Meituan takeout app. Our source code is available at https://github.com/W-void/DSAIN

  RES  Disentangling Motives behind Item Consumption and Social Connection for Mutually-enhanced Joint Prediction  
  by Youchen Sun (Nanyang Technological University), Zhu Sun (A*STAR), Xiao Sha (Nanyang Technological University), Jie Zhang (Nanyang Technological University) and Yew Soon Ong (Nanyang Technological University). | Item consumption and social connection, as common user behaviors in many web applications, have been extensively studied. However, most current works separately perform either item or social link prediction tasks, possibly with the help of the other as an auxiliary signal. Moreover, they merely consider the behaviors in a holistic manner yet neglect the multi-faceted motives behind them (e.g., watching movies to kill time or with friends; connecting with others due to friendships or colleagues). To fill the gap, we propose to disentangle the multi-faceted motives in each network, defined respectively by the two types of behaviors, for mutually- enhanced joint prediction (DMJP). Specifically, we first learn the disentangled user representations driven by motives of multi-facets in both networks. Thereafter, the mutual influence of the two networks is subtly discriminated at the facet-to-facet level. The fine-grained mutual influence, proven to be asymmetric, is then exploited to help refine user representations in both networks, with the goal of achieving a mutually-enhanced joint item and social link prediction. Empirical studies on three public datasets showcase the superiority of DMJP against state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on both tasks.

  RES  Distribution-based Learnable Filters with Side Information for Sequential Recommendation  
  by Haibo Liu (School of Cyber Security and Computer, HeBei university), Zhixiang Deng (School of Cyber Security and Computer, HeBei university), Liang Wang (School of Cyber Security and Computer, HeBei university), Jinjia Peng (School of Cyber Security and Computer, HeBei university) and Shi Feng (School of Computer Science & Engineering, Northeastern University). | Sequential Recommendation aims to predict the next item by mining out the dynamic preference from user previous interactions. However, most methods represent each item as a single fixed vector, which is incapable of capturing the uncertainty of item-item transitions that result from time-dependent and multifarious interests of users. Besides, they fail to effectively exploit side information that helps to better express user preferences. At last, the noise in user’s access sequence, which is due to accidental clicks, can interfere with the next item prediction and lead to lower recommendation performance. To deal with these issues, we propose DLFS-Rec, a novel model that combines Distribution-based Learnable Filters with Side information for sequential Recommendation. Specifically, items and their side information are represented by stochastic Gaussian distribution, which is described by mean and covariance embeddings, and then the corresponding embeddings are fused to generate a final representation for each item. To attenuate noise, stacked learnable filter layers are applied to smooth the fused embeddings. The similarities between the distributions inferred from the last filter layer and candidates are measured by 2-Wasserstein distance for generating recommendation list. Extensive experiments on four public real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over state-of-the-art baselines, especially on cold start users and items.

  RES  Domain Disentanglement with Interpolative Data Augmentation for Dual-Target Cross-Domain Recommendation  
  by Jiajie Zhu (Macquarie University), Yan Wang (Macquarie University), Feng Zhu (Ant Group) and Zhu Sun (Macquarie University). | The conventional single-target Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) aims to improve the recommendation performance on a sparser target domain by transferring the knowledge from a source domain that contains relatively richer information. By contrast, in recent years, dual-target CDR has been proposed to improve the recommendation performance on both domains simultaneously. However, to this end, there are two challenges in dual-target CDR: (1) how to generate both relevant and diverse augmented user representations, and (2) how to effectively decouple domain-independent information from domain-specific information, in addition to domain-shared information, to capture comprehensive user preferences. To address the above two challenges, we propose a Disentanglement-based framework with Interpolative Data Augmentation for dual-target Cross-Domain Recommendation, called DIDA-CDR. In DIDA-CDR, we first propose an interpolative data augmentation approach to generating both relevant and diverse augmented user representations to augment sparser domain and explore potential user preferences. We then propose a disentanglement module to effectively decouple domain-specific and domain-independent information to capture comprehensive user preferences. Both steps significantly contribute to capturing more comprehensive user preferences, thereby improving the recommendation performance on each domain. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world datasets show the significant superiority of DIDA-CDR over the state-of-the-art methods.

  RES  DREAM: Decoupled Representation via Extraction Attention Module and Supervised Contrastive Learning for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommender  
  by Xiaoxin Ye (School of Computer Science and Engineering, UNSW), Yun Li (School of Computer Science and Engineering, UNSW) and Lina Yao (CSIRO Data61, School of Computer Science and Engineering UNSW). | Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation(CDSR) aims to generate accurate predictions for future interactions by leveraging users’ cross-domain historical interactions. One major challenge of CDSR is how to jointly learn the single- and cross-domain user preferences efficiently. To enhance the target domain’s performance, most existing solutions start by learning the single-domain user preferences within each domain and then transferring the acquired knowledge from the rich domain to the target domain. However, this approach ignores the inter-sequence item relationship and also limits the opportunities for target domain knowledge to enhance the rich domain performance. Moreover, it also ignores the information within the cross-domain sequence. Despite cross-domain sequences being generally noisy and hard to learn directly, they contain valuable user behavior patterns with great potential to enhance performance. Another key challenge of CDSR is data sparsity, which also exists in other recommendation system problems. In the real world, the data distribution of the recommendation system is highly skewed to the popular products, especially on the large-scale dataset with millions of users and items. One more challenge is the class imbalance problem, inherited by the Sequential Recommendation problem. Generally, each sample only has one positive and thousands of negative samples. To address the above problems together, an innovative Decoupled Representation via Extraction Attention Module (DREAM) is proposed for CDSR to simultaneously learn single- and cross-domain user preference via decoupled representations. A novel Supervised Contrastive Learning framework is introduced to model the inter-sequence relationship as well as address the data sparsity via data augmentations. DREAM also leverages Focal Loss to put more weight on misclassified samples to address the class-imbalance problem, with another uplift on the overall model performance. Extensive experiments had been conducted on two cross-domain recommendation datasets, demonstrating DREAM outperforms various SOTA cross-domain recommendation algorithms achieving up to a 75% uplift in Movie-Book Scenarios.

Existing solutions apply general sequential data augmentation strategies to generate positive pairs and encourage their representations to be invariant. However, due to the inherent properties of user behavior sequences, some augmentation strategies, such as item substitution, can lead to changes in user intent. Learning indiscriminately invariant representations for all augmentation strategies might be sub-optimal. Therefore, we propose Equivariant Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation (ECL-SR), which endows SR models with great discriminative power, making the learned user behavior representations sensitive to invasive augmentations (e.g., item substitution) and insensitive to mild augmentations (e.g., feature-level dropout masking). In detail, we use the conditional discriminator to capture differences in behavior due to item substitution, which encourages the user behavior encoder to be equivariant to invasive augmentations. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that the proposed ECL-SR framework achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art SR models. The source code will be released.

  RES  Exploring False Hard Negative Sample in Cross-Domain Recommendation  
  by Haokai Ma (Shandong University), Ruobing Xie (WeChat, Tencent), Lei Meng (School of software, Shandong University), Xin Chen (tencent), Xu Zhang (WeChat Search Application Department, Tencent Inc.), Leyu Lin (WeChat Search Application Department, Tencent) and Jie Zhou (Wechat, Tencent). | Negative Sampling in recommendation aims to capture informative negative instances for the sparse user-item interactions to improve the performance. Conventional negative sampling methods tend to select informative hard negative samples (HNS) besides the default random samples. However, these hard negative sampling methods usually struggle with false hard negative samples (FHNS), which happens when a user-item interaction has not been observed yet and is picked as a negative sample, while the user will actually interact with this item once exposed to it. Such FHNS issues may seriously confuse the model training, while most conventional hard negative sampling methods do not systematically explore and distinguish FHNS from HNS. To address this issue, we propose a novel model-agnostic Real Hard Negative Sampling (RealHNS) framework specially for cross-domain recommendation (CDR), which aims to discover the false and refine the real from all HNS via both general and cross-domain real hard negative sample selectors. For the general part, we conduct the coarse-grained and fine-grained real HNS selectors sequentially, armed with a dynamic item-based FHNS filter to find high-quality HNS. For the cross-domain part, we further design a new cross-domain HNS for alleviating negative transfer in CDR and discover its corresponding FHNS via a dynamic user-based FHNS filter to keep its power. We conduct experiments on four datasets based on three representative model-agnostic hard negative sampling methods, along with extensive model analyses, ablation studies, and universality analyses. The consistent improvements indicate the effectiveness, robustness, and universality of RealHNS, which is also easy-to-deploy in real-world systems as a plug-and-play strategy. The source code will be released in the future.

  RES  Fast and Examination-agnostic Reciprocal Recommendation in Matching Markets  
  by Yoji Tomita (CyberAgent, Inc.), Riku Togashi (CyberAgent, Inc.), Yuriko Hashizume (CyberAgent, Inc.) and Naoto Ohsaka (CyberAgent, Inc.). | n matching markets such as job posting and online dating platforms, the recommender system plays a critical role in the success of the platform. Unlike standard recommender systems that suggest items to users, reciprocal recommender systems (RRSs) that suggest other users must take into account the mutual interests of users. In addition, ensuring that recommendation opportunities do not disproportionately favor popular users is essential for the total number of matches and for fairness among users. Existing recommendation methods in matching markets, however, face computational challenges on large-scale platforms and depend on specific examination functions in the position-based model (PBM). In this paper, we introduce the reciprocal recommendation method based on the matching with transferable utility (TU matching) model in the context of ranking recommendations in matching markets and propose a fast and examination-model-free algorithm. Furthermore, we evaluate our approach on experiments with synthetic data and real-world data from an online dating platform in Japan. Our method performs better than or as well as existing methods in terms of the number of total matches and works well even in a large-scale dataset for which one existing method does not work.

  RES  Full Index Deep Retrieval: End-to-End User and Item Structures for Cold-start and Long-tail Item Recommendation  
  by Zhen Gong (Shanghai Jiao Tong University), Xin Wu (Bytedance Inc.), Lei Chen (Bytedance Inc.), Zhenzhe Zheng (Shanghai Jiao Tong University), Shengjie Wang (Bytedance Inc.), Anran Xu (Shanghai Jiao Tong University), Chong Wang (Bytedance Inc.) and Fan Wu (Shanghai Jiao Tong University). | End-to-end retrieval models, such as Tree-based Models (TDM) and Deep Retrieval (DR), have attracted a lot of attention, but they are flawed in cold-start and long-tail item recommendation scenarios. Specifically, DR learns a compact indexing structure, enabling efficient and accurate retrieval for large recommendation systems. However, it is discovered that DR largely fails on retrieving cold-start and long-tail items. This is because DR only utilizes user-item interaction data, which is rare and often noisy for cold-start and long-tail items. And the end-to-end retrieval models are unable to make use of the rich item content features. To address this issue while maintaining the efficiency of DR indexing structure, we propose Full Index Deep Retrieval (FIDR) that learns indices for the full corpus items, including cold-start and long-tail items. In addition to the original structure in DR (called User Structure in FIDR) that learns with user-item interaction data (e.g., clicks), we add an Item Structure to embed items directly based on item content features (e.g., categories). With joint efforts of User Structure and Item Structure, FIDR makes cold-start items retrievable and also improves the recommendation quality of long-tail items. To our best knowledge, FIDR is the first to solve the cold-start and long-tail recommendation problem for the end-to-end retrieval models. Through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, we demonstrate that FIDR can effectively recommend cold-start and long-tail items and largely promote overall recommendation performance without sacrificing inference efficiency. According to the experiments, the recall of FIDR is improved by 8.8% ~ 11.9%, while the inference of FIDR is as efficient as DR.

  RES  Generative Learning Plan Recommendation for Employees: A Performance-aware Reinforcement Learning Approach  
  by Zhi Zheng (University of Science and Technology of China), Ying Sun (The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)), Xin Song (Baidu), Hengshu Zhu (BOSS Zhipin) and Hui Xiong (The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)). | With the rapid development of enterprise Learning Management Systems (LMS), more and more companies are trying to build enterprise training and course learning platforms for promoting the career development of employees. Indeed, through course learning, many employees have the opportunity to improve their knowledge and skills. For these systems, a major issue is how to recommend learning plans, i.e., a set of courses arranged in the order they should be learned, that can help employees improve their work performance. Existing studies mainly focus on recommending courses that users are most likely to click on by capturing their learning preferences. However, the learning preference of employees may not be the right fit for their career development, and thus it may not necessarily mean their work performance can be improved accordingly. Furthermore, how to capture the mutual correlation and sequential effects between courses, and ensure the rationality of the generated results, is also a major challenge. To this end, in this paper, we propose the Generative Learning plAn recommenDation (GLAD) framework, which can generate personalized learning plans for employees to help them improve their work performance. Specifically, we first design a performance predictor and a rationality discriminator, which have the same transformer-based model architecture, but with totally different parameters and functionalities. In particular, the performance predictor is trained for predicting the work performance of employees based on their work profiles and historical learning records, while the rationality discriminator aims to evaluate the rationality of the generated results. Then, we design a learning plan generator based on the gated transformer and the cross-attention mechanism for learning plan generation. We calculate the weighted sum of the output from the performance predictor and the rationality discriminator as the reward, and we use Self-Critical Sequence Training (SCST) based policy gradient methods to train the generator following the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) paradigm. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world data clearly validate the effectiveness of our GLAD framework compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods and reveal some interesting findings for talent management

  RES  Goal-Oriented Multi-Modal Interactive Recommendation with Verbal and Non-Verbal Relevance Feedback  
  by Yaxiong Wu (University of Glasgow), Craig Macdonald (University of Glasgow) and Iadh Ounis (University of Glasgow). | Interactive recommendation enables users to provide verbal and non-verbal relevance feedback (such as natural-language critiques and likes/dislikes) when viewing a ranked list of recommendations (such as images of fashion products) to guide the recommender system towards their desired items (i.e. goals) across multiple interaction turns. The multi-modal interactive recommendation (MMIR) task has been successfully formulated with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms by simulating the interactions between an environment (i.e. a user) and an agent (i.e. a recommender system). However, it is typically challenging and unstable to optimise the agent to improve the recommendation quality associated with implicit learning of multi-modal representations in an end-to-end fashion in DRL. This is known as the coupling of policy optimisation and representation learning. To address this coupling issue, we propose a novel goal-oriented multi-modal interactive recommendation model (GOMMIR) that uses both verbal and non-verbal relevance feedback to effectively incorporate the users’ preferences over time. Specifically, our GOMMIR model employs a multi-task learning approach to explicitly learn the multi-modal representations using a multi-modal composition network when optimising the recommendation agent. Moreover, we formulate the MMIR task using goal-oriented reinforcement learning and enhance the optimisation objective by leveraging non-verbal relevance feedback for hard negative sampling and providing extra goal-oriented rewards to effectively optimise the recommendation agent. Following previous work, we train and evaluate our GOMMIR model by using user simulators that can generate natural-language feedback about the recommendations as a surrogate for real human users. Experiments conducted on four well-known fashion datasets demonstrate that our proposed GOMMIR model yields significant improvements in comparison to the existing state-of-the-art baseline models.

  RES  Going Beyond Local: Global Graph-Enhanced Personalized News Recommendations  
  by Boming Yang (The University of Tokyo), Dairui Liu (University College Dublin), Toyotaro Suzumura (The University of Tokyo), Ruihai Dong (University College Dublin) and Irene Li (The University of Tokyo). | Precisely recommending candidate news articles to users has always been a core challenge for personalized news recommendation systems. Most recent work primarily focuses on using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract semantic information from rich textual data, employing content-based methods derived from locally viewed historical clicked news. However, this approach lacks a global perspective, failing to account for users’ hidden motivations and behaviors beyond semantic information. To address this challenge, we propose a novel model called GLORY(Global-LOcal news Recommendation sYstem), which combines global news representations learned from other users with local news representations to enhance personalized recommendation systems. We accomplish this by constructing a Global Clicked News Encoder, which includes a global news graph and employs gated graph neural networks to fuse news representations, thereby enriching clicked news representations. Similarly, we extend this approach to a Global Candidate News Encoder, utilizing a global entity graph and candidate news fusion to enhance candidate news representation. Evaluation results on two public news datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. Furthermore, our model offers more diverse recommendations.

  by Cheng Wang (School of Cyber Science and Engineering,Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan), Jiacheng Sun (Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab), Zhenhua Dong (Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab), Ruixuan Li (School of Computer Science and Technology,Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan) and Rui Zhang (ruizhang.info). | The cost of hardware and energy consumption on training a click-through rate (CTR) model is highly prohibitive. A recent promising direction for reducing such costs is data distillation with gradient matching, which aims to synthesize a small distilled dataset to guide the model to a similar parameter space as those trained on real data. However, there are two main challenges to implementing such a method in the recommendation field: (1) The categorical recommended data are high dimensional and sparse one- or multi-hot data which will block the gradient flow, causing backpropagation-based data distillation invalid. (2) The data distillation process with gradient matching is computationally expensive due to the bi-level optimization. To this end, we investigate efficient data distillation tailored for recommendation data with plenty of side information where we formulate the discrete data to the dense and continuous data format. Then, we further introduce a one-step gradient matching scheme, which performs gradient matching for only a single step to overcome the inefficient training process. The overall proposed method is called Categorical data distillation with Gradient Matching (CGM), which is capable of distilling a large dataset into a small of informative synthetic data for training CTR models from scratch. Experimental results show that our proposed method not only outperforms the state-of-the-art coreset selection and data distillation methods but also has remarkable cross-architecture performance. Moreover, we explore the application of CGM on continual updating and mitigate the effect of different random seeds on the training results.

  RES  gSASRec: Reducing Overconfidence in Sequential Recommendation Trained with Negative Sampling  
  by Aleksandr V. Petrov (University of Glasgow) and Craig Macdonald (University of Glasgow). | Large catalogue size is one of the central challenges in training recommendation models: a large number of items makes it infeasible to compute scores for all items during training, forcing models to deploy negative sampling. However, negative sampling increases the proportion of positive interactions in the training data. Therefore models trained with negative sampling tend to overestimate the probabilities of positive interactions — a phenomenon we call overconfidence. While the absolute values of the predicted scores/probabilities are unimportant for ranking retrieved recommendations, overconfident models may fail to estimate nuanced differences in the top-ranked items, resulting in degraded performance. This paper shows that overconfidence explains why the popular SASRec model underperforms when compared to BERT4Rec (contrary to the BERT4Rec authors’ attribution to the bi-directional attention mechanism). We propose a novel Generalised Binary Cross-Entropy Loss function (gBCE) to mitigate overconfidence and theoretically prove that it can mitigate overconfidence. We further propose the gSASRec model, an improvement over SASRec that deploys an increased number of negatives and gBCE loss. We show through detailed experiments on three datasets that gSASRec does not exhibit the overconfidence problem. As a result, gSASRec can outperform BERT4Rec (e.g.\ +9.47\% NDCG on MovieLens-1M), while requiring less training time (e.g.\ -73\% training time on MovieLens-1M). Moreover, in contrast to BERT4Rec, gSASRec is suitable for large datasets that contain more than 1 million items.

  RES  How Should We Measure Filter Bubbles? A Regression Model and Evidence for Online News  
  by Lien Michiels (UAntwerpen), Jorre Vannieuwenhuyze (Statistiek Vlaanderen), Jens Leysen (University of Antwerp), Robin Verachtert (Froomle NV), Annelien Smets (imec-SMIT, Vrije Universiteit Brussel) and Bart Goethals (University of Antwerp). | News media play an important role in democratic societies. Central to fulfilling this role is the premise that users should be exposed to diverse news. However, news recommender systems are gaining popularity on news websites, which has sparked concerns over filter bubbles. Editors, policy-makers and scholars are worried that news recommender systems may expose users to less diverse content over time. To the best of our knowledge, this hypothesis has not been tested in a longitudinal observational study of real users that interact with a real news website. Such observational studies require the use of research methods that are robust and can account for the many covariates that may influence the diversity of recommendations at any given time. In this work, we propose an analysis model to study whether the variety of articles recommended to a user decreases over time, in observational studies of real news websites with real users. Further, we present results from two case studies using aggregated and anonymized data that were collected by two western European news websites employing a collaborative filtering-based news recommender system to serve (personalized) recommendations to their users. Through these case studies we validate empirically that our modeling assumptions are sound and supported by the data, and that our model obtains more reliable and interpretable results than analysis methods used in prior empirical work on filter bubbles. Our case studies provide evidence of a small decrease in the topic variety of a user’s recommendations in the first weeks after they sign up, but no evidence of a decrease in political variety.

  RES  Incentivizing Exploration in Linear Contextual Bandits under Information Gap  
  by Huazheng Wang (Oregon State University), Haifeng Xu (University of Chicago), Chuanhao Li (University of Virginia), Zhiyuan Liu (University of colorado,boulder) and Hongning Wang (University of Virginia). | Contextual bandit algorithms have been popularly used to address interactive recommendation, where the users are assumed to be cooperative to explore all recommendations from a system. In this paper, we relax this strong assumption and study the problem of incentivized exploration with myopic users, where the users are only interested in recommendations with their currently highest estimated reward. As a result, in order to obtain long-term optimality, the system needs to offer compensation to incentivize the users to take the exploratory recommendations. We consider a new and practically motivated setting where the context features employed by the user are more \emph{informative} than those used by the system: for example, features based on users’ private information are not accessible by the system. We develop an effective solution for incentivized exploration under such an information gap, and prove that the method achieves a sublinear rate in both regret and compensation. We theoretically and empirically analyze the added compensation due to the information gap, compared with the case where the system has access to the same context features as the user does, i.e., without information gap. Moreover, we also provide a compensation lower bound of this problem.

  RES  InTune: Reinforcement Learning-based Data Pipeline Optimization for Deep Recommendation Models  
  by Kabir Nagrecha (University of California, San Diego), Lingyi Liu (Netflix, Inc.), Pablo Delgado (Netflix, Inc.) and Prasanna Padmanabhan (Netflix, Inc.). | Deep learning-based recommendation models (DLRMs) have become an essential component of many modern recommender systems. Several companies are now building large compute clusters reserved only for DLRM training, driving new interest in cost- & time- saving optimizations. The systems challenges faced in this setting are unique; while typical deep learning (DL) training jobs are dominated by model execution times, the most important factor in DLRM training performance is often online data ingestion.  
 In this paper, we explore the unique characteristics of this data ingestion problem and provide insights into the specific bottlenecks and challenges of the DLRM training pipeline at scale. We study real-world DLRM data processing pipelines taken from our compute cluster to both observe the performance impacts of online ingestion and to identify shortfalls in existing data pipeline optimizers. We find that current tooling either yields sub-optimal performance, frequent crashes, or else requires impractical cluster re-organization to adopt. Our studies lead us to design and build a new solution for data pipeline optimization, InTune. InTune employs a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to learn how to distribute CPU resources across a DLRM data pipeline to more effectively parallelize data-loading and improve throughput. Our experiments show that InTune can build an optimized data pipeline configuration within only a few minutes, and can easily be integrated into existing training workflows. By exploiting the responsiveness and adaptability of RL, InTune achieves significantly higher online data ingestion rates than existing optimizers, thus reducing idle times in model execution and increasing efficiency. We apply InTune to our real-world cluster, and find that it increases data ingestion throughput by as much as 2.29X versus current state-of-the-art data pipeline optimizers while also improving both CPU & GPU utilization.

  RES  KGTORe: Tailored Recommendations through Knowledge-aware GNN Models  
  by Alberto Carlo Maria Mancino (Politecnico di Bari), Antonio Ferrara (Politecnico di Bari), Salvatore Bufi (Polytechnic University of Bari), Daniele Malitesta (Polytechnic University of Bari), Tommaso Di Noia (Polytechnic University of Bari) and Eugenio Di Sciascio (Polytechnic University of Bari). | Knowledge graphs (KG) have been proven to be a powerful source of side information to enhance the performance of recommendation algorithms. Their graph-based structure paves the way for the adoption of graph-aware learning models such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this respect, state-of-the-art models achieve good performance and interpretability via user-level combinations of intents leading users to their choices. Unfortunately, such results often come from and end-to-end learnings that considers a combination of the whole set of features contained in the KG without any analysis of the user decisions. In this paper, we introduce KGTORe, a GNN-based model that exploits KG to learn latent representations for the semantic features, and consequently, interpret the user decisions as a personal distillation of the item feature representations. Differently from previous models, KGTORe does not need to process the whole KG at training time but relies on a selection of the most discriminative features for the users, thus resulting in improved performance and personalization. Experimental results on three well-known datasets show that KGTORe achieves remarkable accuracy performance and several ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of its components.

  RES  Knowledge-based Multiple Adaptive Spaces Fusion for Recommendation  
  by Meng Yuan (Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Beihang University, Beijing 100191, China), Fuzhen Zhuang (Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Beihang University, Beijing 100191, China), Zhao Zhang (University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100191, China), Deqing Wang (School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing 100191, China) and Jin Dong (Beijing Academy of Blockchain and Edge Computing). | Since Knowledge Graphs (KGs) contain rich semantic information, recently there has been an influx of KG-enhanced recommendation methods. Most of existing methods are entirely designed based on euclidean space without considering curvature. However, recent studies have revealed that a tremendous graph-structured data exhibits highly non-euclidean properties. Motivated by these observations, in this work, we propose a knowledge-based multiple adaptive spaces fusion method for recommendation, namely MCKG. Unlike existing methods that solely adopt a specific manifold, we introduce the unified space that is compatible with hyperbolic, euclidean and spherical spaces. Furthermore, we fuse the multiple unified spaces in an attention manner to obtain the high-quality embeddings for better knowledge propagation. In addition, we propose a geometry-aware optimization strategy which enables the pull and push processes benefited from both hyperbolic and spherical spaces. Specifically, in hyperbolic space, we set smaller margins in the area near to the origin, which is conducive to distinguishing between highly similar positive items and negative ones. At the same time, we set larger margins in the area far from the origin to ensure the model has sufficient error tolerance. The similar manner also applies to spherical spaces. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the MCKG has a significant improvement over state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Further ablation experiments verify the importance of multi-space fusion and geometry-aware optimization strategy, justifying the rationality and effectiveness of MCKG.

  RES  Masked and Swapped Sequence Modeling for Next Novel Basket Recommendation in Grocery Shopping  
  by Ming Li (University of Amsterdam), Mozhdeh Ariannezhad (University of Amsterdam), Andrew Yates (University of Amsterdam) and Maarten de Rijke (University of Amsterdam). | Next basket recommendation (NBR) is the task of predicting the next set of items based on a sequence of already purchased baskets. It is a recommendation task that has been widely studied, especially in the context of grocery shopping. In NBR, it is useful to distinguish between repeat items, i.e., items that a user has consumed before, and explore items, i.e., items that a user has not consumed before. Most NBR work either ignores this distinction or focuses on repeat items.  
 We formulate the next novel basket recommendation (NNBR) task, i.e., the task of recommending a basket that only consists of novel items, which is valuable for both real-world application and NBR evaluation. We evaluate how existing NBR methods perform on the NNBR task and find that, so far, limited progress has been made w.r.t. the NNBR task. To address the NNBR task, we propose a simple bi-directional transformer basket recommendation model (BTBR), which is focused on directly modeling item-to-item correlations within and across baskets instead of learning complex basket representations. To properly train BTBR, we propose and investigate several masking strategies and training objectives: (i) item-level random masking, (ii) item-level select masking, (iii) basket-level all masking, (iv) item basket-level explore masking, and (v) joint masking. In addition, an item-basket swapping strategy is proposed to enrich the item interactions within the same baskets.  
 We conduct extensive experiments on three open datasets with various characteristics. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of BTBR and our masking and swapping strategies for the NNBR task. BTBR with a properly selected masking and swapping strategy can substantially improve the NNBR performance.

  RES  Multi-Relational Contrastive Learning for Recommendation  
  by Wei Wei (University of Hong Kong), Lianghao Xia (University of Hong Kong) and Chao Huang (University of Hong Kong). | Dynamic behavior modeling has become a crucial task for personalized recommender systems that aim to learn users’ time-evolving preferences on online platforms. However, many recommendation models rely on a single type of behavior learning, which significantly limits their ability to represent user-item relationships in real-life applications where interactions between users and items often come in multiple types (e.g., click, tag-as-favorite, review, and purchase). To offer better recommendations, this paper proposes the Evolving Graph Contrastive Memory Network (EGCM) to model dynamic interaction heterogeneity. Firstly, we develop a multi-relational graph encoder to capture short-term preference heterogeneity and preserve the dedicated relation semantics for different types of user-item interactions. Additionally, we design a dynamic cross-relational memory network that enables EGCM to capture users’ long-term multi-behavior preferences and the underlying evolving cross-type behavior dependencies over time. To obtain robust and informative user representations with both commonality and diversity across multi-behavior interactions, we design a multi-relational contrastive learning paradigm with heterogeneous short- and long-term interest modeling. We further provide theoretical analyses to support the modeling of commonality and diversity from the perspective of enhancing model optimization. Experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our recommender system over various state-of-the-art baselines.

  RES  Multi-task Item-attribute Graph Pre-training for Strict Cold-start Item Recommendation  
  by Yuwei Cao (University of Illinois at Chicago), Liangwei Yang (University of Illinois Chicago), Chen Wang (University of Illinois Chicago), Zhiwei Liu (Salesforce Inc.), Hao Peng (Beihang University), Chenyu You (Yale University) and Philip Yu (University of Illinois Chicago). | Recommendation systems suffer in the strict cold-start (SCS) scenario, where the user-item interactions are entirely unavailable. The well-established, dominating identity (ID)-based approaches completely fail to work. Cold-start recommenders, on the other hand, leverage item contents (brand, title, descriptions, etc.) to map the new items to the existing ones. However, the existing SCS recommenders explore item contents in coarse-grained manners that introduce noise or information loss. Moreover, informative data sources other than item contents, such as users’ purchase sequences and review texts, are largely ignored. In this work, we explore the role of the fine-grained item attributes in bridging the gaps between the existing and the SCS items and pre-train a knowledgeable item-attribute graph for SCS item recommendation. Our proposed framework, ColdGPT, models item-attribute correlations into an item-attribute graph by extracting fine-grained attributes from item contents. ColdGPT then transfers knowledge into the item-attribute graph from various available data sources, i.e., item contents, historical purchase sequences, and review texts of the existing items, via multi-task learning. To facilitate the positive transfer, ColdGPT designs specific submodules according to the natural forms of the data sources and proposes to coordinate the multiple pre-training tasks via unified alignment-and-uniformity losses. Our pre-trained item-attribute graph acts as an implicit, extendable item embedding matrix, which enables the SCS item embeddings to be easily acquired by inserting these items into the item-attribute graph and propagating their attributes’ embeddings. We carefully process three public datasets, i.e., Yelp, Amazon-home, and Amazon-sports, to guarantee the SCS setting for evaluation. Extensive experiments show that ColdGPT consistently outperforms the existing SCS recommenders by large margins and even surpasses models that are pre-trained on 75 – 224 times more, cross-domain data on two out of four datasets. Our code and pre-processed datasets for SCS evaluations are publicly available to help future SCS studies.

  RES  Online Matching: A Real-time Bandit System for Large-scale Recommendations  
  by Xinyang Yi (Google), Shao-Chuan Wang (Google), Ruining He (Google), Hariharan Chandrasekaran (Google), Charles Wu (Google), Lukasz Heldt (Google), Lichan Hong (Google), Minmin Chen (Google) and Ed Chi (Google). | The last decade has witnessed many successes of deep learning-based models for industry-scale recommender systems. These models are typically trained offline in a batch manner. While being effective in capturing users’ past interactions with recommendation platforms, batch learning suffers from long model-update latency and is vulnerable to system biases, making it hard to adapt to distribution shift and explore new items or user interests. Although online learning-based approaches (e.g., multi-armed bandits) have demonstrated promising theoretical results in tackling these challenges, their practical real-time implementation in large-scale recommender systems remains limited. First, the scalability of online approaches in servicing a massive online traffic while ensuring timely updates of bandit parameters poses a significant challenge. Additionally, exploring uncertainty in recommender systems can easily result in unfavorable user experience, highlighting the need for devising intricate strategies that effectively balance the trade-off between exploitation and exploration. In this paper, we introduce \textsl{Online Matching}: a scalable closed-loop bandit system learning from users’ direct feedback on items in real time. We present a hybrid \textsl{offline + online} approach for constructing this system, accompanied by a comprehensive exposition of the end-to-end system architecture. We propose Diag-LinUCB — a novel extension of the LinUCB algorithm — to enable distributed updates of bandits parameter in a scalable and timely manner. We conduct live experiments in YouTube and show that Online Matching is able to enhance the capabilities of fresh content discovery and item exploration in the present platform.

  RES  Pairwise Intent Graph Embedding Learning for Context-Aware Recommendation  
  by Dugang Liu (Guangdong Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Economy (SZ)), Yuhao Wu (Shenzhen University), Weixin Li (Shenzhen University), Xiaolian Zhang (Huawei 2012 Lab), Hao Wang (Huawei 2012 Lab), Qinjuan Yang (Huawei 2012 Lab) and Zhong Ming (College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University). | Although knowledge graph have shown their effectiveness in mitigating data sparsity in many recommendation tasks, they remain underutilized in context-aware recommender systems (CARS) with the specific sparsity challenges associated with the contextual features, i.e., feature sparsity and interaction sparsity. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel pairwise intent graph embedding learning (PING) framework to efficiently integrate knowledge graph into CARS. Specifically, our PING contains three modules: 1) a graph construction module is used to obtain a pairwise intent graph (PIG) containing nodes for users, items, entities and enhanced intent, where enhanced intent nodes are generated by applying user intent fusion (UIF) on relational intent and contextual intent, and two sub-intents are derived from the semantic information and contextual information, respectively; 2) a pairwise intent joint graph convolution module is used to obtain the refined embeddings of all the features by executing a customized convolution strategy on PIG, where each enhanced intent node acts as a hub to efficiently propagate information among different features and between all the features and knowledge graph; 3) a recommendation module with the refined embeddings is used to replace the randomly initialized embeddings of downstream recommendation models to improve model performance. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets to verify the effectiveness and compatibility of our PING.

  RES  Reciprocal Sequential Recommendation  
  by Bowen Zheng (Renmin University of China), Yupeng Hou (Renmin University of China), Wayne Xin Zhao (Renmin University of China), Yang Song (BOSS Zhipin) and Hengshu Zhu (BOSS Zhipin). | Reciprocal recommender system (RRS), considering a two-way matching between two parties, has been widely applied in online platforms like online dating and recruitment. Existing RRS models mainly capture static user preferences, which have neglected the evolving user tastes and the dynamic matching relation between the two parties. Although dynamic user modeling has been well-studied in sequential recommender systems, existing solutions are developed in a user-oriented manner. Therefore, it is non-trivial to adapt sequential recommendation algorithms to reciprocal recommendation. In this paper, we formulate RRS as a distinctive sequence matching task, and further propose a new approach ReSeq for RRS, which is short for Reciprocal Sequential recommendation. To capture duel-perspective matching, we propose to learn fine-grained sequence similarities by co-attention mechanism across different time steps. Further, to improve the inference efficiency, we introduce the self-distillation technique to distill knowledge from the fine-grained matching module into the more efficient student module. In the deployment stage, only the efficient student module is used, greatly speeding up the similarity computation. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets from two scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

  RES  Rethinking Multi-Interest Learning for Candidate Matching in Recommender Systems  
  by Yueqi Xie (HKUST), Jingqi Gao (Upstage), Peilin Zhou (HKUST (gz)), Qichen Ye (Peking University), Yining Hua (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Jae Boum Kim (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology), Fangzhao Wu (MSRA) and Sunghun Kim (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology). | Existing research efforts for multi-interest candidate matching in recommender systems mainly focus on improving model architecture or incorporating additional information, neglecting the importance of training schemes. This work revisits the training framework and uncovers two major problems hindering the expressiveness of learned multi-interest representations. First, the current training objective (i.e., uniformly sampled softmax) fails to effectively train discriminative representations in a multi-interest learning scenario due to the severe increase in easy negative samples. Second, a routing collapse problem is observed where each learned interest may collapse to express information only from a single item, resulting in information loss. To address these issues, we propose the REMI framework, consisting of an Interest-aware Hard Negative mining strategy (IHN) and a Routing Regularization (RR) method. IHN emphasizes interest-aware hard negatives by proposing an ideal sampling distribution and developing a Monte-Carlo strategy for efficient approximation. RR prevents routing collapse by introducing a novel regularization term on the item-to-interest routing matrices. These two components enhance the learned multi-interest representations from both the optimization objective and the composition information. REMI is a general framework that can be readily applied to various existing multi-interest candidate matching methods. Experiments on three real-world datasets show our method can significantly improve state-of-the-art methods with easy implementation and negligible computational overhead.

  RES  SPARE: Shortest Path Global Item Relations for Efficient Session-based Recommendation  
  by Andreas Peintner (Universität Innsbruck), Amir Reza Mohammadi (Universität Innsbruck) and Eva Zangerle (Universität Innsbruck). | Session-based recommendation aims to predict the next item based on a set of anonymous sessions. Capturing user intent from a short interaction sequence imposes a variety of challenges since no user profiles are available and interaction data is naturally sparse. Recent approaches relying on graph neural networks (GNNs) for session-based recommendation use global item relations to explore collaborative information from different sessions. These methods capture the topological structure of the graph and rely on multi-hop information aggregation in GNNs to exchange information along edges. Consequently, graph-based models suffer from noisy item relations in the training data and introduce high complexity for large item catalogs. We propose to explicitly model the multi-hop information aggregation mechanism over multiple layers via shortest-path edges based on knowledge from the sequential recommendation domain. Our approach does not require multiple layers to exchange information and ignores unreliable item-item relations. Furthermore, to address inherent data sparsity, we are the first to apply supervised contrastive learning by mining data-driven positive and hard negative item samples from the training data. Extensive experiments on three different datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms almost all of the state-of-the-art methods.

  RES  STAN: Stage-Adaptive Network for Multi-Task Recommendation by Learning User Lifecycle-Based Representation  
  by Wanda Li (Tsinghua University), Wenhao Zheng (Shopee Company), Xuanji Xiao (Shopee Company) and Suhang Wang (Penn State University). | Recommendation systems play a vital role in many online platforms, with their primary objective being to satisfy and retain users. As directly optimizing user retention is challenging, multiple evaluation metrics are often employed. Existing methods generally formulate the optimization of these evaluation metrics as a multi-task learning problem, but often overlook the fact that user preferences for different tasks are personalized and change over time. Identifying and tracking the evolution of user preferences can lead to better user retention. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of “user lifecycle,” consisting of multiple stages characterized by users’ varying preferences for different tasks. We propose a novel \textbf{St}age-\textbf{A}daptive \textbf{N}etwork (\textbf{STAN}) framework for modeling user lifecycle stages. STAN first identifies latent user lifecycle stages based on learned user preferences, and then employs the stage representation to enhance multi-task learning performance. Our experimental results using both public and industrial datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly improves multi-task prediction performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the importance of considering user lifecycle stages in recommendation systems. Furthermore, online A/B testing reveals that our model outperforms the existing model, achieving a significant improvement of 3.05\% in staytime per user and 0.88\% in CVR. These results indicate that our approach effectively improves the overall efficiency of the multi-task recommendation system.

Compared with the former SRS models, the transformer-based models get promising performance on SRS tasks. Existing transformer-based SRS frameworks, however, retain the vanilla attention mechanism, which calculates the attention scores between all item-item pairs in each layer, i.e., item interactions. Consequently, redundant item interactions may downgrade the inference speed and cause high memory costs for the model. In this paper, we first identify the sparse information phenomenon in transformer-based SRS scenarios and propose an efficient model, i.e., Sparse Transformer sequential Recommendation model (STRec). First, we devise a cross-attention-based sparse transformer for efficient sequential recommendation. Then, a novel sampling strategy is derived to preserve the necessary interactions. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our framework, which could outperform the state-of-the-art accuracy while reducing 54% inference time and 70% memory cost. Besides, we provide massive extended experiments to further investigate the property of our framework. Our code is available to ease reproducibility.

A core property of the multi-step conversion is the sequential dependence among tasks. Most existing works focus far more on the specific post-view click-through rate (CTR) and post-click conversion rate (CVR) estimations, which neglect the generalization of sequential dependence multi-task learning (SDMTL). Besides, the performance of the SDMTL framework is also deteriorated by the interference derived from implicitly conflict information passing between adjacent tasks. In this paper, a systematic learning paradigm of the SDMTL problem is established for the first time, which can transform the SDMTL problem into a general MTL problem and be applicable to more general multi-step conversion scenarios with longer conversion path or stronger task dependence. Also, the distribution dependence between adjacent task spaces is illustrated from a theoretical point of view. On the other hand, an SDMTL architecture, named Task Aware Feature Extraction (TAFE), is developed to enable dynamic task representation learning from a sample-wise view. TAFE selectively reconstructs the implicit shared information corresponding to each sample case and performs explicit task-specific extraction under dependence constraints. Extensive experiments on offline public and real-world industrial datasets, and online A/B implementations demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of proposed theoretical and implementation frameworks.

  RES  Towards Robust Fairness-aware Recommendation  
  by Hao Yang (Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China), Zhining Liu (Ant Group), Zeyu Zhang (Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China), Chenyi Zhuang (Ant Group) and Xu Chen (Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China). | Due to the progressive advancement of trustworthy machine learning algorithms, fairness in recommender systems is attracting increasing attention and is often considered from the perspective of users. Conventional fairness-aware recommendation models make the assumption that user preferences remain the same between the training set and the testing set. However, this assumption is disagreed with reality, where user preference can shift in the testing set due to the natural spatial or temporal heterogeneity. It is concerning that conventional fairness-aware models may be unaware of such distribution shifts, leading to a sharp decline in the model performance. To address the distribution shift problem, we propose a robust fairness-aware recommendation framework based on Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) technique. In specific, we assign learnable weights for each sample to approximate the distributions that leads to the worst-case model performance, and then optimize the fairness-aware recommendation model to improve the worst-case performance in terms of both fairness and recommendation accuracy. By iteratively updating the weights and the model parameter, our framework can be robust to unseen testing sets. To ease the learning difficulty of DRO, we use a hard clustering technique to reduce the number of learnable sample weights. To optimize our framework in a full differentiable manner, we soften the above clustering strategy. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments based on four real-world datasets to verify the effectiveness of our proposed framework. For benefiting the research community, we have released our project at https://anonyrobfair.github.io/.

Though widely useful, such ‘trending now‘ carousels typically generate item lists based on simple heuristics, e.g., the number of interactions within a time interval, and therefore still leave much room for improvement. This paper aims to systematically study this under-explored but important problem from the new perspective of time series forecasting. We first provide a set of rigorous definitions related to item trendiness with associated evaluation protocols, and then propose a deep latent variable model, dubbed Trend Recommender (TrendRec), to forecast items’ future trend and generate trending item lists. Experiments on real-world datasets from various domains show that our TrendRec significantly outperforms the baselines, verifying our model’s effectiveness.

For example, a user who watched 80 entertainment videos and 20 knowledge videos is expected to receive recommendations comprising about 80% entertainment and 20% knowledge videos as well. However, with the increasing calls for quality-aware responsible recommendation, it has become inadequate to just match users’ historical behaviors, which could still lead to undesired effects at the system level (e.g., overwhelming clickbaits). In this paper, we envision the two-sided calibration task that not only matches the users’ past interests distribution (user-level calibration) but also guarantees an overall target exposure distribution of different item groups (system-level calibration). The target group exposure distribution can be explicitly pursued by users, platform owners, and even the law (e.g., the platform owners expect about 50% knowledge video recommendation on the whole). To support this scenario, we propose a post-processing method named PCT. PCT first solves personalized calibration targets that minimize the changes in users’ historical interest distributions while ensuring the overall target group exposure distribution. Then, PCT reranks the original recommendation lists according to personalized calibration targets to generate both relevant and two-sided calibrated recommendations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to calibrated and fairness-aware recommendation approaches. We also release a new dataset with item quality annotations to support further studies about quality-aware responsible recommendation.

  RES  Uncovering User Interest from Biased and Noised Watch Time in Video Recommendation  
  by Haiyuan Zhao (Renmin University of China), Lei Zhang (Renmin University of China), Jun Xu (Renmin University of China), Guohao Cai (Huawei Noah’s ark lab), Zhenhua Dong (Huawei Noah’s ark lab) and Ji-Rong Wen (Renmin University of China). | In micro-video recommendation scenarios, watch time is commonly adopted as an indicator of users’ interest. However, watch time is not only determined by the matching of users’ interests but is affected by other factors. These factors mainly lie in two folds: on the one hand, users tend to spend more time on those charming videos with the growth of the duration (i.e., video length), named as duration bias; on the other hand, it costs people a period of time to judge whether they like the video, named as noisy watching. Consequently, the existence of duration bias and noisy watching make watch time an inadequate label for training a reliable recommendation model. Moreover, current methods focus only on the duration bias and ignore the duration noise, so they do not really uncover the user interest from watch time. In this study, we first analyze the generation mechanism of users’ watch time in a unified causal viewpoint. Unlike current methods, which only notice the duration bias in watch time, we considered the watch time as a mixture of the user’s actual interest, the duration biased watch time, and the noisy watch time. To mitigate both the duration bias and noisy watching, we propose Debiased and Denoised watch time Correction (D$^2$Co), which can be divided into two steps: First, we employ a duration-wise Gaussian Mixture Model plus frequency-weighted moving average for estimating the bias and noise terms; Then we utilize a sensitivity-controlled correction function to separate the user interest from the watch time, which is robust to the estimation error of bias and noise terms. The experiments on two public video recommendation datasets indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

  RES  Understanding and Modeling Passive-Negative Feedback for Short-video Sequential Recommendation  
  by Yunzhu Pan (UESTC), Chen Gao (Tsinghua University), Yang Song (Kuaishou Inc.), Kun Gai (Unaffiliated), Depeng Jin (Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University) and Yong Li (Tsinghua University). | Sequential recommendation is one of the most important tasks in recommender systems, which aims to recommend the next interacted item with historical behaviors as input. Traditional sequential recommendation always mainly considers the collected positive feedback such as click, purchase, etc. However, in short-video platforms such as TikTok, video viewing behavior may not always represent positive feedback. Specifically, the videos are played automatically, and users passively receive the recommended videos. In this new scenario, users passively express negative feedback by skipping over videos they do not like, which provides valuable information about their preferences. Different from the negative feedback studied in traditional recommender systems, this passive-negative feedback can reflect users’ interests and serve as an important supervision signal in extracting users’ preferences. Therefore, it is essential to carefully design and utilize it in this novel recommendation scenario. In this work, we first conduct analyses based on a large-scale real-world short-video behavior dataset and illustrate the significance of leveraging passive feedback. We then propose a novel method that deploys the sub-interest encoder, which incorporates positive feedback and passive-negative feedback as supervision signals to learn the user’s current active sub-interest. Moreover, we introduce an adaptive fusion layer to integrate various sub-interests effectively. To enhance the robustness of our model, we then introduce a multi-task learning module to simultaneously optimize two kinds of feedback – passive-negative feedback and traditional randomly-sampled negative feedback. The experiments on two large-scale datasets verify that the proposed method can significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches. The codes and collected datasets are anonymously released at https:// anonymous.4open.science/ r/ SINE-2047/ to benefit the community.

  RES  What We Evaluate When We Evaluate Recommender Systems: Understanding Recommender Systems’ Performance using Item Response Theory  
  by Yang Liu (University of Helsinki), Alan Medlar (University of Helsinki) and Dorota Glowacka (University of Helsinki). | Current practices in offline evaluation use rank-based metrics to measure the quality of recommendation lists. This approach has practical benefits as it centers assessment on the output of the recommender system and, therefore, measures performance from the perspective of end-users. However, this methodology neglects how recommender systems more broadly model user preferences, which is not captured by only considering the top-n recommendations. In this article, we use item response theory (IRT), a family of latent variable models used in psychometric assessment, to gain a comprehensive understanding of offline evaluation. We used IRT to jointly estimate the latent abilities of 51 recommendation algorithms and the characteristics of 3 commonly used benchmark data sets. For all data sets, the latent abilities estimated by IRT suggest that higher scores from traditional rank-based metrics do not reflect improvements in modeling user preferences. Furthermore, we show the top-n recommendations with the most discriminatory power are biased towards lower difficulty items, leaving much room for improvement. Lastly, we highlight the role of popularity in evaluation by investigating how user engagement and item popularity influence recommendation difficulty.

  RES  When Fairness meets Bias: a Debiased Framework for Fairness aware Top-N Recommendation  
  by Jiakai Tang (Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China), Shiqi Shen (Wechat, Tencent, Beijing), Zhipeng Wang (Wechat, Tencent, Beijing), Zhi Gong (Wechat, Tencent, Beijing), Jingsen Zhang (Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China) and Xu Chen (Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China). | Fairness in the recommendation domain has recently attracted increasing attention due to the more and more concerns on the algorithm discrimination and ethics. While recent years have witnessed many promising fairness aware recommender models, an important problem has been largely ignored, that is, the fairness can be biased due to the user personalized selection tendencies or the non-uniform item exposure probabilities. To study this problem, in this paper, we formally define a novel task named as unbiased fairness aware Top-N recommendation. For solving this task, we firstly define an ideal loss function based on all the user-item pairs. Considering that, in real-world datasets, only a small number of user-item interactions can be observed, we then approximate the above ideal loss with a more tractable objective based on the inverse propensity score (IPS). Since the recommendation datasets can be noisy and quite sparse, which brings difficulties for accurately estimating the IPS, we propose to optimize the objective in an IPS range instead of a specific point, which improve the model fault tolerance capability. In order to make our model more applicable to the commonly studied Top-N recommendation, we soften the ranking metrics such as Precision, Hit-Ratio and NDCG to derive an fully differentiable framework. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model based on four real-world datasets.

 RES  A Probabilistic Position Bias Model for Short-Video Recommendation Feeds  
  by Olivier Jeunen (ShareChat UK). | Modern web-based platforms often show ranked lists of recommendations to users, in an attempt to maximise user satisfaction or business metrics. Typically, the goal of such systems boils down to maximising the exposure probability — conversely, minimising the rank— for items that are deemed “reward-maximising” according to some metric of interest. This general framing comprises music or movie streaming applications, as well as e-commerce, restaurant or job recommendations, and even web search. Position bias or user models can be used to estimate exposure probabilities for each use-case, specifically tailored to how users interact with the presented rankings. A unifying factor in these diverse problem settings is that typically only one or several items will be engaged with (clicked, streamed, purchased, et cetera) before a user leaves the ranked list. Short-video feeds on social media platforms diverge from this general framing in several ways, most notably that users do not tend to leave the feed after, for example, liking a post. Indeed, seemingly infinite feeds invite users to scroll further down the ranked list. For this reason, existing position bias or user models tend to fall short in such settings, as they do not accurately capture users’ interaction modalities. In this work, we propose a novel and probabilistically sound personalised position bias model for feed recommendations. We focus on a 1st-level feed in a hierarchical structure, where users may enter a 2nd-level feed via any given 1st-level item. We posit that users come to the platform with a given scrolling budget that is drawn according to a discrete power-law distribution, and show how the survival function of said distribution can be used to obtain closed-form estimates for personalised exposure probabilities. Empirical insights gained through data from a large-scale social media platform show how our probabilistic position bias model more accurately captures empirical exposure than existing models, and paves the way for improved unbiased evaluation and learning-to-rank.

  RES  ADRNet: A Generalized Collaborative Filtering Framework Combining Clinical and Non-Clinical Data for Adverse Drug Reaction Prediction  
  by Haoxuan Li (Center for Data Science, Peking University), Taojun Hu (Peking University), Zetong Xiong (Zhongnan University of Economic and Law), Chunyuan Zheng (University of California, San Diego), Fuli Feng (University of Science and Technology of China), Xiangnan He (University of Science and Technology of China) and Xiao-Hua Zhou (Peking University). | Adverse drug reaction (ADR) prediction plays a crucial role in both health care and drug discovery for reducing patient mortality and enhancing drug safety. Recently, many studies have been devoted to effectively predict the drug-ADRs incidence rates. However, these methods either did not effectively utilize non-clinical data, i.e., physical, chemical, and biological information about the drug, or did little to establish a link between content-based and pure collaborative filtering during the training phase. In this paper, we first formulate the prediction of multi-label ADRs as a drug-ADR collaborative filtering problem, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide extensive benchmark results of previous collaborative filtering methods on two large publicly available clinical datasets. Then, by exploiting the easy accessible drug characteristics from non-clinical data, we propose ADRNet, a generalized collaborative filtering framework combining clinical and non-clinical data for drug-ADR prediction. Specifically, ADRNet has a shallow collaborative filtering module and a deep drug representation module, which can exploit the high-dimensional drug descriptors to further guide the learning of low-dimensional ADR latent embeddings, which incorporates both the benefits of collaborative filtering and representation learning. Extensive experiments are conducted on two publicly available real-world drug-ADR clinical datasets and two non-clinical datasets to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed ADRNet.

  RES  Using Learnable Physics for Real-Time Exercise Form Recommendations  
  by Abhishek Jaiswal (Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur), Gautam Chauhan (Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur) and Nisheeth Srivastava (Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur). | Good posture and form are essential for safe and productive exercising. Even in gym settings, trainers may not be readily available for feedback. Rehabilitation therapies and fitness workouts can thus benefit from recommender systems that provide real-time evaluation. In this paper, we present an algorithmic pipeline that can diagnose problems in exercises technique and offer corrective recommendations, with high sensitivity and specificity, in real-time. We use MediaPipe for pose recognition, count repetitions using peak-prominence detection, and use a learnable physics simulator to track motion evolution for each exercise. A test video is diagnosed based on deviations from the prototypical learned motion using statistical learning. The system is evaluated on six full and upper body exercises. These real-time interactive suggestions counseled via low-cost equipment like smartphones will allow exercisers to rectify potential mistakes making self-practice feasible while reducing the risk of workout injuries.

  RES  ReCon: Reducing Congestion in Job Recommendation using Optimal Transport  
  by Yoosof Mashayekhi (Ghent University), Bo Kang (Ghent University), Jefrey Lijffijt (Ghent University) and Tijl de Bie (Ghent University). | Recommender systems may suffer from congestion, meaning that there is an unequal distribution of the items in how often they are recommended. Some items may be recommended much more than others. Recommenders are increasingly used in domains where items have limited availability, such as the job market, where congestion is especially problematic: Recommending a vacancy—for which typically only one person will be hired—to a large number of job seekers may lead to frustration for job seekers, as they may be applying for jobs where they are not hired. This may also leave vacancies unfilled and result in job market inefficiency. We propose a novel approach to job recommendation called ReCon, accounting for the congestion problem. Our approach is to use an optimal transport component to ensure a more equal spread of vacancies over job seekers, combined with a job recommendation model in a multi-objective optimization problem. We evaluated our approach on two real-world job market datasets. The evaluation results show that ReCon has good performance on both congestion-related (e.g., Congestion) and desirability (e.g., NDCG) measures.

  RES  Optimizing Long-term Value for Auction-Based Recommender Systems via On-Policy Reinforcement Learning  
  by Ruiyang Xu (Meta AI), Jalaj Bhandari (Meta AI), Dmytro Korenkevych (Meta AI), Fan Liu (Meta), Yuchen He (Meta), Alex Nikulkov (Meta AI) and Zheqing Zhu (Meta AI). | Auction-based recommender systems are prevalent in online advertising platforms, but they are typically optimized to allocate recommendation slots based on immediate expected return metrics, neglecting the downstream effects of recommendations on user behavior. In this study, we employ reinforcement learning to optimize for long-term return metrics in an auction-based recommender system. Utilizing temporal difference learning, a fundamental reinforcement learning algorithm, we implement a \textit{one-step policy improvement approach} that biases the system towards recommendations with higher long-term user engagement metrics. This optimizes value over long horizons while maintaining compatibility with the auction framework. Our approach is based on dynamic programming ideas which show that our method provably improves upon the existing auction-based base policy. Through an online A/B test conducted on an auction-based recommender system, which handles billions of impressions and users daily, we empirically establish that our proposed method outperforms the current production system in terms of long-term user engagement metrics.

  RES  Analysis Operations for Constraint-based Recommender Systems  
  by Sebastian Lubos (Institute of Software Technology – Graz University of Technology), Viet-Man Le (Graz University of Technology), Alexander Felfernig (TU Graz) and Thi Ngoc Trang Tran (Graz University of Technology). | Constraint-based recommender systems support users in the identification of complex items such as financial services and digital cameras. Such recommender systems enable users to find an appropriate item within the scope of a conversational process. In this context, relevant items are determined by matching user preferences with a corresponding product (item) assortment on the basis of a pre-defined set of constraints. The development and maintenance of constraint-based recommenders is often an error-prone activity – specifically with regard to the scoping of the offered item assortment. In this paper, we propose a set of offline analysis operations that provide insights to assess the quality of a constraint-based recommender system before the system is deployed for productive use. The operations include a.o. automated analysis of feature restrictiveness and item (product) accessibility. We analyze usage scenarios of the proposed analysis operations on the basis of a simplified example digital camera recommender.

  RES  Bootstrapped Personalized Popularity for Cold Start Recommender Systems  
  by Iason Chaimalas (University College London), Duncan Walker (British Broadcasting Corporation), Edoardo Gruppi (University College London), Ben Clark (British Broadcasting Corporation) and Laura Toni (University College London). | Recommender Systems are severely hampered by the well-known Cold Start problem, identified by the lack of information on new items and users. This has led to research efforts focused on data imputation and augmentation models as predominantly data pre-processing strategies, yet their improvement of cold-user performance is largely indirect and often comes at the price of a reduction in accuracy for warmer users. To address these limitations, we propose Bootstrapped Personalized Popularity (B2P), a novel framework that improves performance for cold users (directly) and cold items (implicitly) via popularity models personalized with item metadata. B2P is scalable to very large datasets and directly addresses the Cold Start problem, so it can complement existing Cold Start strategies. Experiments on a real-world Enterprise dataset (anonymized) and a public dataset demonstrate that B2P (1) significantly improves cold-user performance, (2) boosts warm-user performance for bootstrapped models by lowering their training sparsity, and (3) improves total recommendation accuracy at a competitive diversity level relative to existing high-performing Collaborative Filtering models. We demonstrate that B2P is a powerful and scalable framework for strongly cold datasets.

  RES  Beyond the Sequence: Statistics-driven Pre-training for Stabilizing Sequential Recommendation Model  
  by Sirui Wang (Meituan Group), Peiguang Li (Meituan Group), Yunsen Xian (Meituan Group) and Hongzhi Zhang (Meituan Group). | The sequential recommendation task aims to predict the item that user is interested in according to his/her historical action sequence. However, inevitable random action, i.e. user randomly accesses an item among multiple candidates or clicks several items at random order, cause the sequence fails to provide stable and high-quality signals. To alleviate the issue, we propose the StatisTics-Driven Pre-traing framework (called STDP briefly). The main idea of the work lies in the exploration of utilizing the statistics information along with the pre-training paradigm to stabilize the optimization of recommendation model. Specifically, we derive two types of statistical information: item co-occurrence across sequence and attribute frequency within the sequence. And we design the following pre-training tasks: 1) The co-occurred items prediction task, which encourages the model to distribute its attention on multiple suitable targets instead of just focusing on the next item that may be unstable. 2) We generate a paired sequence by replacing items with their co-occurred items and enforce its representation close with the original one, thus enhancing the model’s robustness to the random noise. 3) To reduce the impact of random on user’s long-term preferences, we encourage the model to capture sequence-level frequent attributes. The significant improvement over six datasets demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of the proposal, and further analysis verified the generalization of the STDP framework on other models.

  RES  Personalized Category Frequency prediction for Buy It Again recommendations  
  by Amit Pande (Target), Kunal Ghosh (Target) and Rankyung Park (Target). | Buy It Again (BIA) recommendations are crucial to retailers to help improve user experience and site engagement by suggest- ing items that customers are likely to buy again based on their own repeat purchasing patterns. Most existing BIA studies analyze guests’ personalized behaviour at item granularity. This finer level of granularity might be appropriate for small businesses or small datasets for search purposes. However, this approach can be infea- sible for big retailers like Amazon, Walmart, or Target which have hundreds of millions of guests and tens of millions of items. For such data sets, it is more practical to have a coarse-grained model that captures customer behaviour at the item category level. In addition, customers commonly explore variants of items within the same categories, e.g., trying different brands or flavors of yogurt. A category-based model may be more appropriate in such scenarios. We propose a recommendation system called a hierarchical PCIC model that consists of a personalized category model (PC model) and a personalized item model within categories (IC model). PC model generates a personalized list of categories that customers are likely to purchase again. IC model ranks items within categories that guests are likely to reconsume within a category. The hierarchical PCIC model captures the general consumption rate of products using survival models. Trends in consumption are captured using time series models. Features derived from these models are used in training a category-grained neural network. We compare PCIC to twelve existing baselines on four standard open datasets. PCIC improves NDCG up to 16% while improving recall by around 2%. We were able to scale and train (over 8 hours) PCIC on a large dataset of 100M guests and 3M items where repeat categories of a guest outnumber repeat items. PCIC was deployed and A/B tested on the site of a major retailer, leading to significant gains in guest engagement.

  RES  Generative Next-Basket Recommendation  
  by Wenqi Sun (Renmin University of China), Ruobing Xie (WeChat, Tencent), Junjie Zhang (Renmin University of China), Wayne Xin Zhao (Renmin University of China), Leyu Lin (WeChat Search Application Department, Tencent) and Ji-Rong Wen (Renmin University of China). | Next-basket Recommendation (NBR) refers to the task of predicting a set of items that a user will purchase in the next basket. However, most of existing works merely focus on the relevance between user preferences and predicted items, ignoring the essential relationships among items in the next basket, which often results in over-homogenization of items. In this work, we presents a novel Generative next-basket Recommendation model (GeRec), a new NBR paradigm that generates the recommended items one by one to form the next basket via an autoregressive decoder. This generative NBR paradigm contributes to capturing and considering item relationships inside each baskets in both training and serving. Moreover, we jointly consider user’s both item- and basket-level contextual information to better capture user’s multi-granularity preferences. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.

The problem involves bounded, adversarial loss and unknown i.i.d. distributions for arm availability. The proposed algorithm extends the sleeping bandit algorithm for single arm selection and is guaranteed to achieve theoretical performance with regret upper bounded by $\bigO(kN^2\sqrt{T\log T})$, where $k$ is the number of arms selected per time step, $N$ is the total number of arms, and $T$ is the time horizon.

  RES  Collaborative filtering algorithms are prone to mainstream-taste bias  
  by Pantelis Analytis (University of Southern Denmark) and Philipp Hager (University of Amsterdam). | Collaborative filtering has been the main steam engine of the recommender systems community since the early 1990s. Collaborative filtering (and other) algorithms, however, have been predominantly evaluated by aggregating results across users or user groups. These performance averages hide large disparities: an algorithm may perform very well for some users (or groups) and very poorly for others. We show that performance variation is large and systematic. In experiments on three large scale datasets and using an array of collaborative filtering algorithms, we demonstrate the large performance disparities for different users across algorithms and datasets. We then show that performance variation is systematic and that two key features that characterize users, their mean taste similarity with other users and the dispersion in taste similarity, can explain performance variation better than previously identified features. We use these two features to visualize algorithm performance for different users, and point out that this mapping can be used to capture different categories of users that have been proposed before. Our results demonstrate an extensive mainstream-taste bias in all collaborative filtering algorithms, and they imply a fundamental fairness limitation that needs to be mitigated.

  RES  Hessian-aware Quantized Node Embeddings for Recommendation  
  by Huiyuan Chen (Visa Research), Kaixiong Zhou (Rice University), Kwei-Herng Lai (Rice University), Chin-Chia Michael Yeh (Visa Research), Yan Zheng (Visa Research), Xia Hu (Rice University) and Hao Yang (Visa Research). | Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in recommender systems. Nevertheless, the process of searching and ranking from a large item corpus usually requires high latency, which limits the widespread deployment of GNNs in industry-scale applications. To address this issue, many methods quantize user/item representations into the binary embedding space to reduce space requirements and accelerate inference. Also, they use the Straight-through Estimator (STE) to prevent zero gradients during back-propagation. However, the STE often causes gradient mismatch problem, leading to sub-optimal results.  
 In this work, we present the Hessian-aware Quantized GNN (HQ-GNN) as an effective solution for discrete representations of users/items that enable fast retrieval. HQ-GNN is composed of two components: a GNN encoder for learning continuous node embeddings and a quantized module for compressing full-precision embeddings into low-bit ones. Consequently, HQ-GNN benefits from both lower memory requirements and faster inference speeds compared to vanilla GNNs. To address the gradient mismatch problem in STE, we further consider the quantized errors and its second-order derivatives for better stability. The experimental results on several large-scale datasets show that HQ-GNN achieves a good balance between latency and performance.

  RES  Scalable Approximate NonSymmetric Autoencoder for Collaborative Filtering

One of the most highly acclaimed shallow autoencoders is EASE, favored for its competitive recommendation accuracy and simultaneous simplicity. However, the poor scalability of EASE (both in time and especially in memory) severely restricts its use in production environments with vast item sets. In this paper, we propose a hyperefficient factorization technique for sparse approximate inversion of the data-Gram matrix used in EASE. The resulting autoencoder, SANSA, is an end-to-end sparse solution with prescribable density and almost arbitrarily low memory requirements (even for training). As such, SANSA allows us to effortlessly scale the concept of EASE to millions of items and beyond.

  RES  M3REC: A Meta-based Multi-scenario Multi-task Recommendation Framework  
  by Zerong Lan (Dalian University of Technology), Yingyi Zhang (Dalian University of technology) and Xianneng Li (Dalian University of Technology). | Users in recommender systems exhibit multi-behavior in multiple business scenarios on real-world e-commerce platforms. A crucial challenge in such systems is to make recommendations for each business scenario at the same time. On top of this, multiple predictions (e.g., Click Through Rate and Conversion Rate) need to be made simultaneously in order to improve the platform revenue. Research focus on making recommendations for several business scenarios is in the field of Multi-Scenario Recommendation (MSR), and Multi-Task Recommendation (MTR) mainly attempts to solve the possible problems in collaboratively executing different recommendation tasks. However, existing researchers have paid attention to either MSR or MTR, ignoring the integration of MSR and MTR that faces the issue of conflict between scenarios and tasks. To address the above issue, we propose a Meta-based Multi-scenario Multi-task RECommendation framework (M3REC) to serve multiple tasks in multiple business scenarios by a unified model. However, integrating MSR and MTR in a proper manner is non-trivial due to: 1) Unified representation problem: Users’ and items’ representation behave Non-i.i.d in different scenarios and tasks which takes inconsistency into recommendations. 2) Synchronous optimization problem: Tasks distribution varies in different scenarios, and a unified optimization method is needed to optimize multi-tasks in multi-scenarios. Thus, to unified represent users and items, we design a Meta-Item-Embedding Generator (MIEG) and a User-Preference Transformer (UPT). The MIEG module can generate initialized item embedding using item features through meta-learning technology, and the UPT module can transfer user preferences in other scenarios. Besides, the M3REC framework uses a specifically designed backbone network together with a task-specific aggregate gate to promote all tasks to achieve the purpose of optimizing multiple tasks in multiple business scenarios within one model. Experiments on two public datasets have shown that M3REC outperforms those compared MSR and MTR state-of-the-art methods.

  RES  Large Language Model Augmented Narrative Driven Recommendations  
  by Sheshera Mysore (University of Massachusetts Amherst), Andrew Mccallum (University of Massachusetts) and Hamed Zamani (University of Massachusetts Amherst). | Narrative-driven recommendation (NDR) presents an information access problem where users solicit recommendations with verbose descriptions of their preferences and context, for example, travelers soliciting recommendations for points of interest while describing their likes/dislikes and travel circumstances. These requests are increasingly important with the rise of natural language-based conversational interfaces for search and recommendation systems. However, NDR lacks abundant training data for models, and current platforms commonly do not support these requests. Fortunately, classical user-item interaction datasets contain rich textual data, e.g., reviews, which often describe user preferences and context — this may be used to bootstrap training for NDR models. In this work, we explore using large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation to train NDR models. We use LLMs for authoring synthetic narrative queries from user-item interactions with few-shot prompting and train retrieval models for NDR on synthetic queries and user-item interaction data. Our experiments demonstrate that this is an effective strategy for training small-parameter retrieval models that outperform other retrieval and LLM baselines for narrative-driven recommendation.

  RES  Incorporating Time in Sequential Recommendation Models  
  by Mostafa Rahmani (Amazon), James Caverlee (Amazon) and Fei Wang (Amazon). | Sequential models are designed to learn sequential patterns in data based on the chronological order of user interactions. However, they often ignore the timestamps of these interactions. Incorporating time is crucial because many sequential patterns are time-dependent, and the model cannot make time-aware recommendations without considering time. This article demonstrates that providing a rich representation of time can significantly improve the performance of sequential models. The existing literature treats time as a one-dimensional time-series obtained by quantizing time. In this study, we propose treating time as a multi-dimensional time-series and explore representation learning methods, including a kernel based method and an embedding-based algorithm. Experiments on multiple datasets show that the inclusion of time significantly enhances the model’s performance, and multi-dimensional methods outperform the one-dimensional method by a substantial margin.

  RES  Enhancing Transformers without Self-supervised Learning: A Loss Landscape Perspective in Sequential Recommendation  
  by Vivian Lai (Visa Research), Huiyuan Chen (Visa Research), Chin-Chia Michael Yeh (Visa Research), Minghua Xu (Visa Research), Yiwei Cai (Visa Research) and Hao Yang (Visa Research). | Transformers have become the favored model for sequential recommendation. However, previous studies rely on extensive data, such as massive pre-training or repeated data augmentation, leading to optimization-related problems, such as initialization sensitivity and large batch-size memory bottleneck. In this work, we examine Transformers’ loss geometry to improve the models’ data efficiency during training and generalization. By utilizing a newly introduced sharpness-aware optimizer to promote smoothness, we significantly enhance SASRec’s accuracy and robustness, a Transformer model, on various datasets. When trained on sequential data without significant pre-training or data augmentation, the resulting SASRec outperforms S3Rec and CL4Rec, both of which are of comparable size and throughput.

  RES  Adaptive Collaborative Filtering with Personalized Time Decay Functions for Financial Product Recommendation  
  by Ashraf Ghiye (École Polytechnique), Baptiste Barreau (BNP Paribas CIB – Global Markets), Laurent Carlier (BNP Paribas CIB – Global Markets) and Michalis Vazirgiannis (École Polytechnique). | Classical recommender systems often assume that historical data are stationary and fail to account for the dynamic nature of user preferences, limiting their ability to provide reliable recommendations in time-sensitive settings. This assumption is particularly problematic in finance, where financial products exhibit continuous changes in valuations, leading to frequent shifts in client interests. These evolving interests, summarized in the past client-product interactions, see their utility fade over time with a degree that might differ from one client to another. To address this challenge, we propose a time-dependent collaborative filtering algorithm that can adaptively discount distant client-product interactions using personalized decay functions. Our approach is designed to handle the non-stationarity of financial data and produce reliable recommendations by modeling the dynamic collaborative signals between clients and products. We evaluate our method using a proprietary dataset from BNP Paribas and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art benchmarks from relevant literature. Our findings emphasize the importance of incorporating time explicitly in the model to enhance the accuracy of financial product recommendation.

  RES  Private Matrix Factorization with Public Item Features  
  by Mihaela Curmei (University of California, Berkeley), Walid Krichene (Google Research) and Li Zhang (Google Research). | We consider the problem of training private recommendation models with access to public item features. Training with Differential Privacy (DP) offers strong privacy guarantees, at the expense of loss in recommendation quality. We show that incorporating public item features during training can help mitigate this loss in quality. We propose a general approach based on collective matrix factorization, that works by simultaneously factorizing two matrices: the user feedback matrix (representing sensitive data) and an item feature matrix that encodes publicly available (non-sensitive) item information.  
 The method is conceptually simple, easy to tune, and highly scalable. It can be applied to different types of public data, including: (1) categorical item features; (2) item-item similarities learned from public sources; and (3) publicly available user feedback.  
 Evaluating our method on a standard DP recommendation benchmark, we find that using public item features significantly narrows the quality gap between the private models and their non-private counterpart. As privacy constraints become more stringent, the increased reliance on public side features leads to recommendations becoming more depersonalized, resulting in a smooth transition from collaborative filtering to item-based contextual recommendations.

  RES  Deliberative Diversity for News Recommendations: Operationalization and Experimental User Study  
  by Lucien Heitz (University of Zurich), Juliane A. Lischka (University of Hamburg), Rana Abdullah (University of Hamburg), Laura Laugwitz (University of Hamburg), Hendrik Meyer (University of Hamburg) and Abraham Bernstein (University of Zurich). | News recommender systems are an increasingly popular field of study that attracts a growing, interdisciplinary research community. As these systems play an important role in our daily lives, the mechanisms behind their curation processes are under close scrutiny. In the domain of personalized news, many platforms make design choices that are driven by economic incentives. In contrast to such systems that optimize for financial gains, there exists norm-driven diversity objectives, putting normative and democratic goals first. Their impact on users, however, in terms of triggering behavioral changes or affecting knowledgeability, is still under-researched. In this paper, we contribute to the field of news recommender system design by conducting a user study that looks at the impact of these normative approaches. We a.) operationalize the notion of deliberative democracy for news recommendations, show b.) the impact on political knowledgeability and c.) the influence on voting behavior. We found that exposure to small parties is associated with an increase in knowledge about their candidates and that intensive news consumption about a party can change the direction of attitudes towards their issues.

  RES  Co-occurrence Embedding Enhancement for Long-tail Problem in Multi-Interest Recommendation  
  by Yaokun Liu (Tianjin University), Xiaowang Zhang (Tianjin University), Minghui Zou (Tianjin University) and Zhiyong Feng (Tianjin University). | Multi-interest recommendation methods extract multiple interest vectors to represent the user comprehensively. Despite their success in the matching stage, previous works overlook the long-tail problem. This results in the model excelling at suggesting head items, while the performance for tail items, which make up more than 70% of all items, remains suboptimal. Hence, enhancing the tail item recommendation capability holds great potential for improving the performance of the multi-interest model.  
 Through experimental analysis, we reveal that the insufficient context for embedding learning is the reason behind the underperformance of tail items. Meanwhile, we face two challenges in addressing this issue: the absence of supplementary item features and the need to maintain head item performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose a CoLT module (Co-occurrence embedding enhancement for Long-Tail problem) that replaces the embedding layer of existing multi-interest frameworks. By linking co-occurring items to establish “assistance relationships”, CoLT aggregates information from relevant head items into tail item embeddings and enables joint gradient updates. Experiments on three datasets show our method outperforms SOTA models by 21.86% Recall@50 and improves the Recall@50 of tail items by 14.62% on average.

  RES  Extended conversion: Capturing successful interactions in voice shopping  
  by Elad Haramaty (Amazon), Zohar Karnin (Amazon), Arnon Lazerson (Amazon), Liane Lewin-Eytan (Amazon Research) and Yoelle Maarek (Amazon). | Being able to measure the success of online shopping interactions is crucial in order to evaluate and optimize the performance of e-commerce systems. We consider the domain of voice shopping, supported by digital voice-based assistants, where measuring successful interactions poses a challenge. Unlike Web shopping, which offers a rich amount of behavioral signals such as clicks, in voice shopping a non-negligible amount of shopping interactions frequently end without any immediate explicit or implicit user behavioral signal. Moreover, users may start their journey using voice, but finish elsewhere, for example by using their mobile app or Web. We explore the challenge of measuring successful interactions in voice product search based on users’ feedback, and propose a medium-term reward metric named Extended ConVersion (ECVR). ECVR extends the notion of conversion (purchase action), which is a clear and natural indication of success for an e-commerce system. The strength of this new metric, is that it does not only capture immediate conversion, but also a conversion that is part of the same user shopping journey, but is performed at a later stage, possibly using a different medium. We provide multiple ways of evaluating the quality of a metric, and use these to explore different parameters leading to different variants of ECVR. After finalizing these parameters, we show that a ranking system optimized for the proposed ECVR leads to an improvement in long-term engagement and revenue, without compromising immediate gains.

  RES  On the Consistency of Average Embeddings for Item Recommendation  
  by Walid Bendada (Deezer Research & LAMSADE, Université Paris Dauphine – PSL), Guillaume Salha-Galvan (Deezer Research), Romain Hennequin (Deezer Research), Thomas Bouabça (Deezer Research) and Tristan Cazenave (LAMSADE Université Paris Dauphine PSL – CNRS). | A prevalent practice in recommender systems consists of averaging item embeddings to represent users or higher-level concepts in the same embedding space. This paper investigates the relevance of such a practice. For this purpose, we propose an expected precision score, designed to measure the consistency of an average embedding relative to the items used for its construction. We subsequently analyze the mathematical expression of this score in a theoretical setting with specific assumptions, as well as its empirical behavior on real-world data from music streaming services. Our results emphasize that real-world averages are less consistent for recommendation, which paves the way for future research to better align real-world embeddings with assumptions from our theoretical setting.

  RES  Integrating the ACT-R Framework with Collaborative Filtering for Explainable Sequential Music Recommendation  
  by Marta Moscati (Johannes Kepler University Linz), Christian Wallmann (Johannes Kepler University Linz), Markus Reiter-Haas (Graz University of Technology), Dominik Kowald (Know-Center GmbH and Graz University of Technology), Elisabeth Lex (Graz University of Technology) and Markus Schedl (Johannes Kepler University Linz). | Music listening sessions often consist of sequences including repeating tracks. Modeling such relistening behavior with models of human memory has been proven effective in predicting the next track of a session. However, these models intrinsically lack the capability of recommending novel tracks that the target user has not listened to in the past. Collaborative filtering strategies, on the contrary, provide novel recommendations by leveraging past collective behaviors but are often limited in their ability to provide explanations. To narrow this gap, we propose four hybrid algorithms that integrate collaborative filtering with the cognitive architecture ACT-R. We compare their performance in terms of accuracy, novelty, diversity, and popularity bias, to baselines of different types, including pure ACT-R, kNN-based, and neural-networks-based approaches. We show that the proposed algorithms are able to achieve the best performances in terms of novelty and diversity, and simultaneously achieve a higher accuracy of recommendation with respect to pure ACT-R models. Furthermore, we illustrate how the proposed models can provide explainable recommendations.

  RES  Widespread flaws in offline evaluation of recommender systems  
  by Balázs Hidasi (Gravity R&D, a Taboola company) and Ádám Tibor Czapp (Gravity R&D, a Taboola company). | Even though offline evaluation is just an imperfect proxy of online performance — due to the interactive nature of recommenders — it will probably remain the primary way of evaluation in recommender systems research for the foreseeable future, since the proprietary nature of production recommenders prevents independent validation of A/B test setups and verification of online results. Therefore, it is imperative that offline evaluation setups are as realistic and as flawless as they can be. Unfortunately, evaluation flaws are quite common in recommenders systems research nowadays, due to later works copying flawed evaluation setups from their predecessors without questioning their validity. In the hope of improving the quality of offline evaluation of recommender systems, we discuss four of these widespread flaws and why researchers should avoid them.

  RES  Towards Sustainability-aware Recommender Systems: Analyzing the Trade-off Between Algorithms Performance and Carbon Footprint  
  by Giuseppe Spillo (University of Bari), Allegra De Filippo (University of Bologna), Cataldo Musto (Dipartimento di Informatica – University of Bari), Michela Milano (University of Bologna) and Giovanni Semeraro (University of Bari). | In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of the trade-off between the performance of state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms and their sustainability. In particular, we compared 18 popular recommendation algorithms in terms of both standard metrics (i.e., accuracy and diversity of the recommendations) as well as in terms of energy consumption and carbon footprint on three different datasets. In order to obtain a fair comparison, all the algorithms were run based on the implementations available in a popular recommendation library, i.e., RecBole, and used the same experimental settings. The outcomes of the experiments clearly showed that the choice of the optimal recommendation algorithm requires a thorough analysis, since more sophisticated algorithms often led to tiny improvements at the cost of an exponential increase of carbon emissions. Through this paper, we aim to shed light on the problem of carbon footprint and energy consumption of recommender systems, and we make the first step towards the development of sustainability-aware recommendation algorithms.

  RES  Group Fairness for Content Creators: the Role of Human and Algorithmic Biases under Popularity-based Recommendations  
  by Stefania Ionescu (University of Zurich), Aniko Hannak (University of Zurich) and Nicolo Pagan (UZH). | The Creator Economy faces concerning levels of unfairness. Content creators (CCs) publicly accuse platforms of purposefully reducing the visibility of their content based on protected attributes, while platforms place the blame on viewer biases. Meanwhile, prior work warns about the “rich-get-richer” effect perpetuated by existing popularity biases in recommender systems: Any initial advantage in visibility will likely be exacerbated over time. What remains unclear is how the biases based on protected attributes from platforms and viewers interact and contribute to the observed inequality in the context of popularity-biased recommender systems. The difficulty of the question lies in the complexity and opacity of the system. To overcome this challenge, we create a simple agent-based model (ABM) that unifies the platform systems which allocate the visibility of CCs (e.g., recommender systems, moderation) into a single popularity-based function, which we call the visibility allocation system (VAS). Through simulations, we find that although viewer homophilic biases do alone create inequalities, small levels of additional biases in VAS are more harmful. From the perspective of interventions, our results suggest that (a) attempts to reduce attribute-biases in moderation and recommendations should precede those reducing viewer homophilic tendencies, (b) decreasing the popularity-biases in VAS decreases but not eliminates inequalities, (c) boosting the visibility of protected CCs to overcome viewer homophily with respect to one metric is unlikely to produce fair outcomes with respect to all metrics, and (d) the process is also unfair for viewers and this unfairness could be overcome through the same interventions. More generally, this work demonstrates the potential of using ABMs to better understand the causes and effects of biases and interventions within complex sociotechnical systems.

  RES  Providing Previously Unseen Users Fair Recommendations Using Variational Autoencoders  
  by Bjørnar Vassøy (Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)), Helge Langseth (Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)) and Benjamin Kille (Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)). | An emerging definition of fairness in machine learning requires that models are oblivious to demographic user information, e.g., a user’s gender or age should not influence the model. Personalized recommender systems are particularly prone to violating this definition through their explicit user focus and user modelling. Explicit user modelling is also an aspect that makes many recommender systems incapable of providing hitherto unseen users with recommendations. We propose novel approaches for mitigating discrimination in Variational Autoencoder-based recommender systems by limiting the encoding of demographic information. The approaches are capable of, and evaluated on, providing entirely new users with fair recommendations.

  RES  Scalable Deep Q-Learning for Session-Based Slate Recommendation  
  by Aayush Singha Roy (Insight Centre for Data Analytics, University College Dublin), Edoardo D’Amico (Insight Centre for Data Analytics, University College Dublin), Elias Tragos (Insight Centre for Data Analytics, University College Dublin), Aonghus Lawlor (Insight Centre for Data Analytics, University College Dublin) and Neil Hurley (Insight Centre for Data Analytics, University College Dublin). | Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated great potential to improve slate-based recommender systems by optimizing recommendations for long-term user engagement. To handle the combinatorial action space in slate recommendation, recent works decompose the Q-value of a slate into item-wise Q-values, using an item-wise value-based policy. However, the common case where the value function is a parameterized function taking state and action as input results in a linearly increasing number of evaluations required to select an action, proportional to the number of candidate items. While slow training may be acceptable, this becomes intractable when considering the costly evaluation of the parameterized function, such as with deep neural networks, during model serving time. To address this issue, we propose an actor-based policy that reduces the evaluation of the Q-function to a subset of items, significantly reducing inference time and enabling practical deployment in real-world industrial settings. In our empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves equivalent user session engagement to a value-based policy, while significantly reducing the slate serving time by at least 4 times.

  RES  CR-SoRec: BERT driven Consistency Regularization for Social Recommendation  
  by Tushar Prakash (Sony Research India), Raksha Jalan (Sony Research india), Brijraj Singh (Sony Research india) and Naoyuki Onoe (Sony). | In the real world, when we seek our friends’ opinions on various items or events, we request verbal social recommendations. It has been observed that we often turn to our friends for recommendations on a daily basis. The emergence of online social platforms has enabled users to share their opinion with their social connections. Therefore, we should consider users’ social connections to enhance online recommendation performance. The social recommendation aims to fuse social links with user-item interactions to offer more relevant recommendations. Several efforts have been made to develop an effective social recommendation system. However, there are two significant limitations to current methods: First, they haven’t thoroughly explored the intricate relationships between the diverse influences of neighbours on users’ preferences. Second, existing models are vulnerable to overfitting due to the relatively low number of user-item interaction records in the interaction space. For the aforementioned problems, this paper offers a novel framework called CR-SoRec, an effective recommendation model based on BERT and Consistency Regularization. This model incorporates Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer(BERT) to learn bidirectional context-aware user and item embeddings with neighbourhood sampling. The neighbourhood Sampling technique samples the most influential neighbours for all the users/ items. Further, to effectively use the available user-item interaction data and social ties, we leverage diverse perspectives via consistency regularisation to harness the underlying information. The main objective of our model is to predict the next item that a user would interact with based on its interaction behaviour and social connections. Experimental results show that our model defines a new state-of-the-art on various datasets and outperforms previous work by a significant margin. Extensive experiments are conducted to analyse the method. We release the source code of our model at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CR-SoRec-68F4

  RES  Large Language Models are Competitive Near Cold-start Recommenders for Language- and Item-based Preferences  
  by Scott Sanner (Google), Krisztian Balog (Google), Filip Radlinski (Google), Ben Wedin (Google) and Lucas Dixon (Google). | Traditional recommender systems leverage users’ item preference history to recommend novel content that users may like. However, dialog interfaces that allow users to express language-based preferences offer a fundamentally different modality for preference input. Inspired by recent successes of prompting paradigms for large language models (LLMs), we study their use for making recommendations from both item-based and language-based preferences in comparison to state-of-the-art item-based collaborative filtering (CF) methods. To support this investigation, we collect a new dataset consisting of both item-based and language-based preferences elicited from users along with their ratings on a variety of (biased) recommended items and (unbiased) random items. Among numerous experimental results, we find that LLMs provide competitive recommendation performance for pure language-based preferences (no item preferences) in the near cold-start case in comparison to item-based CF methods, despite having no supervised training for this specific task (zero-shot) or only a few labels (few-shot). This is particularly promising as language-based preference representations are more explainable and scrutable than item-based or vector-based representations.

  RES  Interface Design to Mitigate Inflation in Recommender Systems  
  by Rana Shahout (Technion), Yehonatan Peisakhovsky (Technion), Sasha Stoikov (Cornell Tech) and Nikhil Garg (Cornell Tech). | Recommendation systems rely on user-provided data to learn about item quality and provide personalized recommendations. An implicit assumption when aggregating ratings into item quality is that ratings are strong indicators of item quality. In this work, we analyze this assumption using data collected from a music discovery application. Our study focuses on two factors that cause rating inflation: heterogeneous user rating behavior and the dynamics of personalized recommendations. We show that user rating behavior is significantly variable, leading to item quality estimates that reflect the users who rated an item more than the item quality itself. Additionally, items that are more likely to be shown via personalized recommendations can experience a substantial increase in their exposure and potential bias toward them. To mitigate these effects, we conducted a randomized controlled trial where the rating interface was modified. This resulted in a substantial improvement in user rating behavior and a reduction in item quality inflation. These findings highlight the importance of carefully considering the assumptions underlying recommendation systems and designing interfaces that encourage accurate rating behavior.

  RES  Towards Self-Explaining Sequence-Aware Recommendation  
  by Alejandro Ariza-Casabona (University of Barcelona), Maria Salamo (Universitat de Barcelona), Ludovico Boratto (University of Cagliari) and Gianni Fenu (University of Cagliari). | Self-explaining models are becoming an important perk of recommender systems, as they help users understand the reason behind certain recommendations, which encourages them to interact more often with the platform. In order to personalize recommendations, modern recommender approaches make the model aware of the user behavior history for interest evolution representation. However, existing explainable recommender systems do not consider the past user history to further personalize the explanation based on the user interest fluctuation. In this work, we propose a SEQuence-Aware Explainable Recommendation model (SEQUER) that is able to leverage the sequence of user-item review interactions to generate better explanations while maintaining recommendation performance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposal on multiple recommendation scenarios. Our source code and preprocessed datasets are available at https://tinyurl.com/SEQUER-RECSYS23.

  RES  Looks Can Be Deceiving: Linking User-Item Interactions and User’s Propensity Towards Multi-Objective Recommendations  
  by Patrik Dokoupil (Department of Software Engineering, Charles University), Ladislav Peska (Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University, Prague, Czechia) and Ludovico Boratto (University of Cagliari). | Multi-objective recommender systems (MORS) provide suggestions to users according to multiple (and possibly conflicting) goals. When a system optimizes its results at the individual-user level, it tailors them on a user’s propensity towards the different objectives. Hence, the capability to understand users’ fine-grained needs towards each goal is crucial. In this paper, we present the results of a user study in which we monitored the way users interacted with recommended items, as well as their self-proclaimed propensities towards relevance, novelty and diversity objectives. The study was divided into several sessions, where users evaluated recommendation lists originating from a relevance-only single-objective baseline as well as MORS. We show that despite MORS-based recommendations attracted less selections, its presence in the early sessions is crucial for users’ satisfaction in the later stages. Surprisingly, the self-proclaimed willingness of users to interact with novel and diverse items is not always reflected in the recommendations they accept. Post-study questionnaires provide insights on how to deal with this matter, suggesting that MORS-based results should be accompanied by elements that allow users to understand the recommendations, so as to facilitate their acceptance.

  RES  Ti-DC-GNN: Incorporating Time-Interval Dual Graphs for Recommender Systems  
  by Nikita Severin (HSE University), Andrey Savchenko (Sber AI Lab), Dmitrii Kiselev (Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (AIRI)), Maria Ivanova (Sber AI Lab), Ivan Kireev (Sber AI Lab) and Ilya Makarov (Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (AIRI)). | Recommender systems are essential for personalized content delivery and have become increasingly popular in recent years. However, traditional recommender systems are limited in their ability to capture complex relationships between users and items. Recently, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a promising solution for improving recommender systems by incorporating temporal and sequential information in dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel method, “Ti-DC-GNN” (Time-Interval Dual Causal Graph Neural Networks), based on an intermediate representation of graph evolution as a sequence of time-interval graphs. The main parts of the method are the novel forms of interval graphs: graph of causality and graph of consequence that explicitly preserve inter-relationships between edges (user-items interactions). The local and global message passing are developed based on edge memory to identify both short-term and long-term dependencies. Experiments on several well-known datasets show that our method consistently outperforms modern temporal GNNs with node memory alone in dynamic edge prediction tasks.

  RES  Of Spiky SVDs and Music Recommendation  
  by Darius Afchar (Deezer Research), Romain Hennequin (Deezer Research) and Vincent Guigue (AgroParisTech). | The truncated singular value decomposition is a widely used methodology in music recommendation for direct similar-item retrieval or embedding musical items for downstream tasks. This paper investigates a curious effect that we show naturally occurring on many recommendation datasets: spiking formations in the embedding space. We first propose a metric to quantify this spiking organization’s strength, then mathematically prove its origin tied to underlying communities of items of varying internal popularity. With this new-found theoretical understanding, we finally open the topic with an industrial use case of estimating how music embeddings’ top-k similar items will change over time under the addition of data.

  RES  Topic-Level Bayesian Surprise and Serendipity for Recommender Systems  
  by Tonmoy Hasan (UNC Charlotte) and Razvan Bunescu (UNC Charlotte). | A recommender system that optimizes its recommendations solely to fit a user’s history of ratings for consumed items can create a filter bubble, wherein the user does not get to experience items from novel, unseen categories. One approach to mitigate this undesired behavior is to recommend items with high potential for serendipity, namely surprising items that are likely to be highly rated. In this paper, we propose a content-based formulation of serendipity that is rooted in Bayesian surprise and use it to measure the serendipity of items after they are consumed and rated by the user. When coupled with a collaborative-filtering component that identifies similar users, this enables recommending items with high potential for serendipity. To facilitate the evaluation of topic-level models for surprise and serendipity, we introduce a dataset of book reading histories extracted from Goodreads, containing over 26 thousand users and close to 1.3 million books, where we manually annotate 450 books read by 4 users in terms of their time-dependent, topic-level surprise. Experimental evaluations show that models that use Bayesian surprise correlate much better with the manual annotations of topic-level surprise than distance-based heuristics, and also obtain better serendipitous item recommendation performance.

  RES  Progressive Horizon Learning: Adaptive Long Term Optimization for Personalized Recommendation  
  by Congrui Yi (Amazon), David Zumwalt (Amazon), Zijian Ni (Amazon) and Shreya Chakrabarti (Amazon). | As B2C companies such as Amazon, Netflix, Spotify scale, personalized recommender systems are often needed to further drive long term business growth in acquisition, engagement, and retention of customers. However, long-term metrics associated with these goals can require several months to mature. Additionally, deep personalization also demands a large volume of training data that take a long time to collect. These factors incur substantial lead time for training a model to optimize a long-term metric. Before such model is deployed, a recommender system has to rely on a simple policy (e.g. random) to collect customer feedback data for training, inflicting high opportunity cost and delaying optimization of the target metric. Besides, as customer preferences can shift over time, a large temporal gap between inputs and outcome poses a high risk of data staleness and suboptimal learning. Existing approaches involve various compromises. For instance, contextual bandits often optimize short-term surrogate metrics with simple model structure, which can be suboptimal in the long run, while Reinforcement Learning approaches rely on an abundance of historical data for offline training, which essentially means long lead time before deployment. To address these problems, we propose Progressive Horizon Learning Recommender (PHLRec), a personalized model that can progressively learn metric patterns and adaptively evolve from short- to long-term optimization over time. Through simulations and real data experiments, we demonstrated that PHLRec outperforms competing methods, achieving optimality in both deployment speed and long-term metric performances.

  RES  Stability of Explainable Recommendation  
  by Sairamvinay Vijayaraghavan (Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis) and Prasant Mohapatra (Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis). | Explainable Recommendation has been gaining attention over the last few years in industry and academia. Explanations provided along with recommendations for each user in a recommender system framework have many uses: particularly reasoning why a suggestion is provided and how well an item aligns with a user’s personalized preferences. Hence, explanations can play a huge role in influencing users to purchase products. However, the reliability of the explanations under varying scenarios has not been strictly verified in an empirical perspective. Unreliable explanations can bear strong consequences such as attackers leveraging explanations for manipulating and tempting users to purchase target items: that the attackers would want to promote. In this paper, we study the vulnerability of existent feature-oriented explainable recommenders, particularly analyzing their performance under different levels of external noises added into model parameters. We conducted experiments by analyzing three important state-of-the-art explainable recommenders when trained on two widely used e-commerce based recommendation datasets of different scales. We observe that all the explainable models are vulnerable to increased noise levels. Experimental results verify our hypothesis that the ability to explain recommendations does decrease along with increasing noise levels and particularly adversarial noise does contribute to a much stronger decrease. Our study presents an empirical verification on the topic of robust explanations in recommender systems which can be extended to different types of explainable recommenders in RS.

  RES  Interpretable User Retention Modeling in Recommendation

User retention rate, which reflects the percentage of today’s users that will return to the recommender system in the next few days, should be paid more attention to in real-world systems. User retention is the most intuitive and accurate reflection of user long-term satisfaction. However, most existing recommender systems are not focused on user retention-related objectives, since their complexity and uncertainty make it extremely hard to discover why a user will or will not return to a system and which behaviors affect user retention. In this work, we conduct a series of preliminary explorations on discovering and making full use of the reasons for user retention in recommendation. Specifically, we make a first attempt to design a rationale contrastive multi-instance learning framework to explore the rationale and improve the interpretability of user retention. Extensive offline and online evaluations with detailed analyses of a real-world recommender system verify the effectiveness of our user retention modeling. We further reveal the real-world interpretable factors of user retention from both user surveys and explicit negative feedback quantitative analyses to facilitate future model designs.

  RES  Deep Exploration for Recommendation Systems  
  by Zheqing Zhu (Meta AI, Stanford University) and Benjamin Van Roy (Stanford University). | Modern recommendation systems ought to benefit by probing for and learning from delayed feedback. Research has tended to focus on learning from a user’s response to a single recommendation. Such work, which leverages methods of supervised and bandit learning, forgoes learning from the user’s subsequent behavior. Where past work has aimed to learn from subsequent behavior, there has been a lack of effective methods for probing to elicit informative delayed feedback. Effective exploration through probing for delayed feedback becomes particularly challenging when rewards are delayed and sparse. To address this, we develop deep exploration methods for recommendation systems. In particular, we formulate recommendation as a sequential decision problem and demonstrate benefits of deep exploration over single-step exploration. Our experiments are carried out with high-fidelity industrial-grade simulators and establish large improvements over existing algorithms.

  RES  Ex2Vec: Characterizing Users and Items from the Mere Exposure Effect  
  by Bruno Sguerra (Deezer Research) and Romain Hennequin (Deezer Research). | The traditional recommendation framework seeks to connect user and content, by finding the best match possible based on users past interaction. However, a good content recommendation is not necessarily similar to what the user has chosen in the past. One limitation of basing future interaction on what happened in the past is that it ignores the fact that both sides of the problems are dynamic. As human, users naturally evolve, learn, forget, get bored, they change their perspective of the world and in consequence, of the recommendable content. In this work we present Ex2Vec our framework for accounting to the dynamic of the human side of the recommendation problem. We introduce the Mere Exposure Effect as a common phenomenon in music streaming platforms. We then present our model that leverage the effect for jointly characterizing users and music. We validate our model through predicting future music consumption based on repetition and discuss its implications.

  RES  TALLRec: An Effective and Efficient Tuning Framework to Align Large Language Model with Recommendation  
  by Keqin Bao (University of Science and Technology in China), Jizhi Zhang (University of Science and Technology in China), Yang Zhang (University of Science and Technology of China), Wenjie Wang (National University of Singapore), Fuli Feng (University of Science and Technology in China) and Xiangnan He (University of Science and Technology of China). | The impressive performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various fields has encouraged researchers to investigate their potential in recommendation tasks. To harness the LLMs’ extensive knowledge and powerful generalization abilities, initial efforts have tried to design instructions for recommendation tasks through In-context Learning. However, the recommendation performance of LLMs remains limited due to (i) significant differences between LLMs’ language-related pre-training tasks and recommendation tasks, and (ii) inadequate recommendation data during the LLMs’ pre-training. To fill the gap, we consider further tuning LLMs for recommendation tasks. To this end, we propose a lightweight tuning framework for LLMs-based recommendation, namely LLM4Rec, which constructs the recommendation data as tuning samples and utilizes LoRA for lightweight tuning. We conduct experiments on two datasets, validating that LLM4Rec is highly efficient w.r.t. computing costs (e.g., a single RTX 3090 is sufficient for tuning LLaMA-7B), and meanwhile, it can significantly enhance the recommendation capabilities of LLMs in the movie and book domains, even with limited tuning samples (< 100 samples). Furthermore, LLM4Rec exhibits strong generalization ability in cross-domain recommendation. Our code and data are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM4rec.

  RES  Initiative transfer in conversational recommender systems  
  by Yuan Ma (University of Duisburg-Essen) and Jürgen Ziegler (University of Duisburg-Essen). | Conversational recommender systems (CRS) are increasingly designed to offer mixed-initiative dialogs in which the user and the system can take turns in starting a communicative exchange, for example, by asking questions or stating preferences. However, whether and when users make use of the mixed-initiative capabilities in a CRS and which factors influence their behavior is as yet not well understood. We report an online study investigating user interaction behavior, especially the transfer of initiative between user and system in a real-time online CRS. We assessed the impact of dialog initiative at the system start as well as of several psychological user characteristics. To collect interaction data, we developed a CRS framework and implementation for the domain of smartphones. Two groups of participants on Prolific (total n=143) used the system which started either with a system-initiated or user-initiated dialog. In addition to interaction data, we measured several psychological factors as well as users’ subjective assessment of the system through questionnaires. We found that: 1. Most users tended to take over the initiative from the system or stay in user-initiated mode when it was offered initially. 2. Starting the dialog in user-initiated mode CRS lead to fewer interactions needed for selecting a product than in system-initiated mode. 3. The user’s initiative transfer was mainly affected by their personal interaction preferences (especially initiative preference). 4. The initial modes of the mixed-initiative CRS did not affect the user experience, but the occurrence of initiative transfers in the dialog negatively affected the degree of user interest and excitement. The results can inform the design and potential personalization of CRS.

Recent methods use different approaches to achieve better performance. However, many of them do not use information about the time of prediction and time intervals between baskets. To fill this gap, we propose a novel method, Time-Aware Item-based Weighting (TAIW), which takes timestamps and intervals into account. We provide experiments on three real-world datasets, and TAIW outperforms well-tuned state-of-the-art baselines for next-basket recommendations. In addition, we show the results of an ablation study and a case study of a few items.

  RES  Is ChatGPT Fair for Recommendation? Evaluating Fairness in Large Language Model Recommendation  
  by Jizhi Zhang (University of Science and Technology of China), Keqin Bao (University of Science and Technology of China), Yang Zhang (University of Science and Technology of China), Wenjie Wang (National University of Singapore), Fuli Feng (University of Science and Technology of China) and Xiangnan He (University of Science and Technology of China). | The resounding triumph of the Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered in a novel LLM for recommendation (LLM4rec) paradigm. Notwithstanding, the capacity of LLM4rec to provide equitable recommendations remains uncharted due to the potential presence of societal prejudices in LLMs. In order to avert the plausible hazard of employing LLM4rec, we scrutinize the fairness of LLM4rec with respect to the users’ sensitive attributes. Owing to the disparity between LLM4rec and the conventional recommendation paradigm, there are challenges in utilizing the conventional recommendation fairness benchmark directly. To explore the fairness of recommendations under the LLM4rec, we propose a new benchmark Fairness in Large language models for Recommendation (FairLR), which consists of carefully designed metrics and a dataset that considers eight sensitive attributes in two recommendation scenarios: music and movie. We utilize our FairLR benchmark to examine ChatGPT and expose that it still demonstrates bias towards certain sensitive attributes while making recommendations.

  RES  Multiple Connectivity Views for Session-based Recommendation  
  by Yaming Yang (School of Artificial Intelligence, Peking University), Jieyu Zhang (University of Washington), Yujing Wang (School of Artificial Intelligence, Peking University), Zheng Miao (School of Artificial Intelligence, Peking University) and Yunhai Tong (Peking University). | Session-based recommendation (SBR), which makes the next-item recommendation based on previous anonymous actions, has drawn increasing attention. The last decade has seen multiple deep learning-based modeling choices applied on SBR successfully, e.g., recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and each modeling choice has its intrinsic superiority and limitation. We argue that these modeling choices differentiate from each other by (1) the way they capture the interactions between items within a session and (2) the operators they adopt for composing the neural network, e.g., convolutional operator or self-attention operator.  
 In this work, we dive deep into the former as it is relatively unique to the SBR scenario, while the latter is shared by general neural network modeling techniques. We first introduce the concept of connectivity view to describe the different item interaction patterns at the input level. Then, we develop the Multiple Connectivity Views for Session-based Recommendation (MCV-SBR), a unified framework that incorporates different modeling choices in a single model through the lens of connectivity view. In addition, MCV-SBR allows us to effectively and efficiently explore the search space of the combinations of connectivity views by the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator Approach (TPE) algorithm. Finally, on three widely used SBR datasets, we verify the superiority of MCV-SBR by comparing the searched models with state-of-the-art baselines. We also conduct a series of studies to demonstrate the efficacy and practicability of the proposed connectivity view search algorithm, as well as other components in MCV-SBR.

 REP  Challenging the Myth of Graph Collaborative Filtering: a Reasoned and Reproducibility-driven Analysis  
  by ito Walter Anelli (Politecnico di Bari), Daniele Malitesta (Polytechnic University of Bari), Claudio Pomo (Politecnico di Bari), Alejandro Bellogin (Universidad Autonoma de Madrid), Eugenio Di Sciascio (Politecnico di Bari) and Tommaso Di Noia (Politecnico di Bari) | Among the most successful research directions in recommender systems, there are undoubtedly graph neural network-based models (GNNs). Through the natural modeling of users and items as a bipartite, undirected graph, GNNs have pushed up the performance bar for modern recommenders.  
 Unfortunately, most of the original graph-based works cherry-pick results from previous baseline papers without bothering to check whether the results are valid for the configuration under analysis. Thus, our work stands first and foremost as a work on the replicability of results. We provide a code that succeeds in replicating the results proposed in the articles introducing six of the most popular and recent graph recommendation models (i.e., NGCF, DGCF, LightGCN, SGL, UltraGCN, and GFCF). In our experimental setup, we test these six models on three common benchmarking datasets (i.e., Gowalla, Yelp 2018, and Amazon Book). In addition, to understand how these models perform with respect to traditional models for collaborative filtering, we compare the graph models under analysis with some models that have historically emerged as the best performers in an offline evaluation context. Then, the study is extended on two new datasets (i.e., Allrecipes and BookCrossing) for which no known setup exists in the literature. Since the performance on such datasets is not entirely aligned with the previous benchmarking one, we further analyze the possible impact of specific dataset characteristics on the recommendation accuracy performance. By investigating the information flow to the users from their neighborhoods, the analysis aims to identify for which models these intrinsic features in the dataset structure impact accuracy performance. The code to reproduce the experiments is available at: https://split.to/Graph-Reproducibility.

  REP  Everyone’s a Winner! On Hyperparameter Tuning of Recommendation Models  
  by Faisal Shehzad (University of Klagenfurt) and Dietmar Jannach (University of Klagenfurt) | The performance of a recommender system algorithm in terms of common offline accuracy measures often strongly depends on the chosen hyperparameters. Therefore, when comparing algorithms in offline experiments, we can obtain reliable insights regarding the effectiveness of a newly proposed algorithm only if we compare it to a number of state-of-the-art baselines that are carefully tuned for each of the considered datasets. While this fundamental principle of any area of applied machine learning is undisputed, we find that the tuning process for the baselines in the current literature is barely documented in much of today’s published research. Ultimately, in case the baselines are actually not carefully tuned, progress may remain unclear. In this paper, we showcase how every method in such an unsound comparison can be reported to be outperforming the state-of-the-art. Finally, we iterate appropriate research practices to avoid unreliable algorithm comparisons in the future.

  REP  HUMMUS: A Linked, Healthiness-Aware, User-centered and Argument-Enabling Recipe Data Set for Recommendation  
  by Felix Bölz (INSA Lyon & University of Passau), Diana Nurbakova (INSA Lyon), Sylvie Calabretto (INSA Lyon), Armin Gerl (University of Passau), Lionel Brunie (INSA Lyon) and Harald Kosch (University of Passau) | The overweight and obesity rate is increasing for decades worldwide. Healthy nutrition is, besides education and physical activity, one of the various keys to tackle this issue. In an effort to increase the availability of digital, healthy recommendations, the scientific area of food recommendation extends its focus from the accuracy of the recommendations to beyond-accuracy goals like transparency and healthiness. To address this issue a data basis is required, which in the ideal case encompasses user-item interactions like ratings and reviews, food-related information like recipe details, nutritional data, and in the best case additional data which describes the food items and their relations semantically. Though several recipe recommendation data sets exist, to the best of our knowledge, a holistic large-scale healthiness-aware and connected data sets have not been made available yet. The lack of such data could partially explain the poor popularity of the topic of healthy food recommendation when compared to the domain of movie recommendation. In this paper, we show that taking into account only user-item interactions is not sufficient for a recommendation. To close this gap, we propose a connected data set called HUMMUS (Health-aware User-centered recoMMedation and argUment enabling data Set) collected from Food.com containing multiple features including rich nutrient information, text reviews, and ratings, enriched by the authors with extra features such as Nutri-scores and connections to semantic data like the FoodKG and the FoodOn ontology. We hope that these data will contribute to the healthy food recommendation domain.

  REP  RecAD: Towards A Unified Library for Recommender Attack and Defense  
  by Changsheng Wang (University of Science and Technology of China), Jianbai Ye (University of Science and Technology of China), Wenjie Wang (National University of Singapore), Chongming Gao (University of Science and Technology of China), Fuli Feng (University of Science and Technology of China) and Xiangnan He (University of Science and Technology of China) | In recent years, recommender systems have become a ubiquitous part of our daily lives, while they suffer from a high risk of being attacked due to the growing commercial and social values. Despite significant research progress in recommender attack and defense, there is a lack of a widely-recognized benchmarking standard in the field, leading to unfair performance comparison and limited credibility of experiments. To address this, we propose RecAD, a unified library aiming at establishing an open benchmark for recommender attack and defense. RecAD takes an initial step to set up a unified benchmarking pipeline for reproducible research by integrating diverse datasets, standard source codes, hyper-parameter settings, running logs, attack knowledge, attack budget, and evaluation results. The benchmark is designed to be comprehensive and sustainable, covering both attack, defense, and evaluation tasks, enabling more researchers to easily follow and contribute to this promising field. RecAD will drive more solid and reproducible research on recommender systems attack and defense, reduce the redundant efforts of researchers, and ultimately increase the credibility and practical value of recommender attack and defense. The project and documents are released at https://github.com/gusye1234/recad.

  REP  Reproducibility Analysis of Recommender Systems relying on Visual Features: traps, pitfalls, and countermeasures  
  by Pasquale Lops (University of Bari), Elio Musacchio (Università degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro), Cataldo Musto (Dipartimento di Informatica – University of Bari), Marco Polignano (Università degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro), Antonio Silletti (Dipartimento di Informatica – University of Bari) and Giovanni Semeraro (Dipartimento di Informatica – University of Bari) | Reproducibility is an important requirement for scientific progress, and the lack of reproducibility for a large amount of published research can hinder the progress over the state-of-the-art. This concerns several research areas, and recommender systems are witnessing the same reproducibility crisis. Even solid works published at prestigious venues might not be reproducible for several reasons: data might not be public, source code for recommendation algorithms might not be available or well documented, and evaluation metrics might be computed using parameters not explicitly provided. In addition, recommendation pipelines are becoming increasingly complex due to the use of deep neural architectures or representations for multimodal side information involving text, images, audio, or video. This makes the reproducibility of experiments even more challenging. In this work, we describe an extension of an already existing open-source recommendation framework, called ClayRS, with the aim of providing the foundation for future reproducibility of recommendation processes involving images as side information. This extension, called ClayRS Can See, is the starting point for reproducing state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms exploiting images. We have provided our implementation of one of these algorithms, namely VBPR – Visual Bayesian Personalized Ranking from Implicit Feedback, and we have discussed all the issues related to the reproducibility of the study to deeply understand the main traps and pitfalls, along with solutions to deal with such complex environments. We conclude the work by proposing a checklist for recommender systems reproducibility as a guide for the research community.

  REP  Reproducibility of Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning Recommendation: Interplay between Effectiveness and Beyond-Accuracy Perspectives  
  by Vincenzo Paparella (Politecnico di Bari), Vito Walter Anelli (Politecnico di Bari), Ludovico Boratto (University of Cagliari) and Tommaso Di Noia (Politecnico di Bari) | Providing effective suggestions is of predominant importance for successful Recommender Systems (RSs). Nonetheless, the need of accounting for additional multiple objectives has become prominent, from both the final users’ and the item providers’ points of view. This need has led to a new class of RSs, called Multi-Objective Recommender Systems (MORSs). These systems are designed to provide suggestions by considering multiple (conflicting) objectives simultaneously, such as diverse, novel, and fairness-aware recommendations. In this work, we reproduce a state-of-the-art study on MORSs that exploits a reinforcement learning agent to satisfy three objectives, i.e., accuracy, diversity, and novelty of recommendations. The selected study is one of the few MORSs where the source code and datasets are released to ensure the reproducibility of the proposed approach. Interestingly, we find that some challenges arise when replicating the results of the original work, due to the nature of multiple-objective problems. We also extend the evaluation of the approach to analyze the impact of improving user-centred objectives of recommendations (i.e., diversity and novelty) in terms of algorithmic bias. To this end, we take into consideration both popularity and category of the items. We discover some interesting trends in the recommendation performance according to different evaluation metrics. In addition, we see that the multi-objective reinforcement learning approach is responsible for increasing the bias disparity in the output of the recommendation algorithm for those items belonging to positively/negatively biased categories. We publicly release datasets and codes in the following GitHub repository: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MORS_reproducibility-BD60

  REP  The effect of third party implementations on reproducibility  
  by Balázs Hidasi (Gravity R&D, a Taboola company) and Ádám Tibor Czapp (Gravity R&D, a Taboola company). The effect of third party implementations on reproducibility | Reproducibility of recommender systems research has come under scrutiny during recent years. Along with works focusing on repeating experiments with certain algorithms, the research community has also started discussing various aspects of evaluation and how these affect reproducibility. We add a novel angle to this discussion by examining how unofficial third-party implementations could benefit or hinder reproducibility. Besides giving a general overview, we thoroughly examine six third-party implementations of a popular recommender algorithm and compare them to the official version on five public datasets. In the light of our alarming findings we aim to draw the attention of the research community to this neglected aspect of reproducibility.

 LBR  A Model-Agnostic Framework for Recommendation via Interest-aware Item Embeddings  
  by Amit Kumar Jaiswal (University of Surrey) and Yu Xiong (University of Surrey). | Item representation holds significant importance in recommendation systems, which encompasses domains such as news, retail, and videos. Retrieval and ranking models utilise item representation to capture the user-item relationship based on user behaviours. While existing representation learning methods primarily focus on optimising item-based mechanisms, such as attention and sequential modelling. However, these methods lack a modelling mechanism to directly reflect user interests within the learned item representations. Consequently, these methods may be less effective in capturing user interests indirectly. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Interest-aware Capsule network (IaCN) recommendation model, a model-agnostic framework that directly learns interest-oriented item representations. IaCN serves as an auxiliary task, enabling the joint learning of both item-based and interest-based representations. This framework adopts existing recommendation models without requiring substantial redesign. We evaluate the proposed approach on benchmark datasets, exploring various scenarios involving different deep neural networks, behaviour sequence lengths, and joint learning ratios of interest-oriented item representations. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance enhancements across diverse recommendation models, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

  LBR  An Exploration of Sentence-Pair Classification for Algorithmic Recruiting  
  by Mesut Kaya (Aalborg University Copenhagen) and Toine Bogers (IT University of Copenhagen). | Recent years have seen a rapid increase in the application of computational approaches to different HR tasks, such as algorithmic hiring, skill extraction, and monitoring of employee satisfaction. Much of the recent work on estimating the fit between a person and a job has used representation learning to represent both resumes and job vacancies computationally and determine the degree to which they match. A common approach to this task is Sentence-BERT, which uses a Siamese network to encode resumes and job descriptions into fixed-length vectors and estimates how well they match based on the similarity between those vectors. In our paper, we adapt BERT’s next-sentence prediction task—predicting whether one sentence is likely to follow another in a given context—to the task of matching resumes with job descriptions. Using historical data on past (mis)matches between job-resume pairs, we fine-tune BERT for this downstream task. Through a combination of offline and online experiments on data from a large Scandinavian job portal, we show that this approach performs significantly better than Sentence-BERT and other state-of-the-art approaches for determining person-job fit.

  LBR  Analyzing Accuracy versus Diversity in a Health Recommender System for Physical Activities: a Longitudinal User Study  
  by Ine Coppens (WAVES – imec – Ghent University), Luc Martens (WAVES – imec – Ghent University) and Toon De Pessemier (WAVES – imec – Ghent University). | As personalization has great potential to improve mobile health apps, analyzing the effect of different recommender algorithms in the health domain is still in its infancy. As such, this paper investigates whether more accurate recommendations from a content-based recommender or more diverse recommendations from a user-based collaborative filtering recommender will lead to more motivation to move. An eight-week longitudinal between-subject user study is being conducted with an Android app in which participants receive personalized recommendations for physical activities and tips to reduce sedentary behavior. The objective manipulation check confirmed that the group with collaborative filtering received significantly more diverse recommendations. The subjective manipulation check showed that the content-based group assigned more positive feedback for perceived accuracy and star rating to the recommendations they chose and executed. However, perceived diversity and inspiringness was significantly higher in the content-based group, suggesting that users might experience the recommendations differently. Lastly, momentary motivation for the executed activities and tips was significantly higher in the content-based group. As such, the preliminary results of this longitudinal study suggest that more accurate and less diverse recommendations have better effects on motivating users to move more.

  LBR  Broadening the Scope: Evaluating the Potential of Recommender Systems beyond prioritizing Accuracy  
  by Vincenzo Paparella (Politecnico di Bari), Dario Di Palma (Politecnico di Bari), Vito Walter Anelli (Politecnico di Bari) and Tommaso Di Noia (Politecnico di Bari). | Although beyond-accuracy metrics have gained attention in the last decade, the accuracy of recommendations is still considered the gold standard to evaluate Recommender Systems (RSs). This approach prioritizes the accuracy of recommendations, neglecting the quality of suggestions to enhance user needs, such as diversity and novelty, as well as trustworthiness regulations in RSs for user and provider fairness. As a result, single metrics determine the success of RSs, but this approach fails to consider other criteria simultaneously. A downside of this method is that the most accurate model configuration may not excel in addressing the remaining criteria. This study seeks to broaden RS evaluation by introducing a multi-objective evaluation that considers all model configurations simultaneously under several perspectives. To achieve this, several hyper-parameter configurations of an RS model are trained, and the Pareto-optimal ones are retrieved. The Quality Indicators (QI) of Pareto frontiers, which are gaining interest in Multi-Objective Optimization research, are adapted to RSs. QI enables evaluating the model’s performance by considering various configurations and giving the same importance to each metric. The experiments show that this multi-objective evaluation overturns the ranking of performance among RSs, paving the way to revisit the evaluation approaches of the RecSys research community. We release codes and datasets in the following GitHub repository: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RecMOE-3ED3.

  LBR  Climbing crags repetitive choices and recommendations  
  by Iustina Ivanova (Independent Researcher). | Outdoor sport climbing in Northern Italy attracts climbers from around the world. While this country has many rock formations, it offers enormous possibilities for adventurous people to explore the mountains. Unfortunately, this great potential causes a problem in finding suitable destinations (crags) to visit for climbing activity. Existing recommender systems in this domain address this issue and suggest potentially interesting items to climbers utilizing a content-based approach. These systems understand users’ preferences from their past logs recorded in an electronic training diary. At the same time, some sports people have a behavioral tendency to revisit the same place for subjective reasons. It might be related to weather and seasonality (for instance, some crags are suitable for climbing in winter/summer only), the users’ preferences (when climbers like specific destinations more than others), or personal goals to be achieved in sport (when climbers plan to try some routes again). Unfortunately, current climbing crags recommendations do not adapt when users demonstrate these repetitive behavior patterns. Sequential recommender systems can capture such users’ habits since their architectures were designed to model users’ next item choice by learning from their previous decision manners. To understand to which extent these sequential recommendations can predict the following crags choices in sport climbing, we analyzed a scenario when climbers show repetitious decisions. Further, we present a data set from collected climbers’ e-logs in the Arco region (Italy) and applied several sequential recommender systems architectures for predicting climbers’ following crags’ visits from their past logs. We evaluated these recommender systems offline and compared ranking metrics with the other reported results on the different data sets. The work concludes that sequential models obtain comparably accurate results as in the other studies and have the prospect for climbers’ subsequent visit prediction and crags recommendations.

  LBR  Continual Collaborative Filtering Through Gradient Alignment  
  by Hieu Do (Singapore Management University) and Hady Lauw (Singapore Management University). | A recommender system operates in a dynamic environment where new items emerge and new users join the system, resulting in ever-growing user-item interactions over time. Existing works either assume a model trained offline on a static dataset (requiring periodic re-training with ever larger datasets); or an online learning setup that favors recency over history. As privacy-aware users could hide their histories, the loss of older information means that periodic retraining may not always be feasible, while online learning may lose sight of users’ long-term preferences. In this work, we adopt a continual learning perspective to collaborative filtering, by compartmentalizing users and items over time into a notion of tasks. Of particular concern is to mitigate catastrophic forgetting that occurs when the model would reduce in performance for older users and items in prior tasks even as it tries to fit the newer users and items in the current task. To alleviate this, we propose a method that leverages gradient alignment to deliver a model that is more compatible across tasks and maximizes user agreement for better user representations to improve long-term recommendations.

  LBR  Evaluating The Effects of Calibrated Popularity Bias Mitigation: A Field Study  
  by Anastasiia Klimashevskaia (MediaFutures, University of Bergen), Mehdi Elahi (MediaFutures, University of Bergen), Dietmar Jannach (University of Klagenfurt), Lars Skjærven (TV 2), Astrid Tessem (TV 2) and Christoph Trattner (MediaFutures, University of Bergen). | Despite their proven various benefits, Recommender Systems can cause or amplify certain undesired effects. In this paper, we focus on Popularity Bias, i.e., the tendency of a recommender system to utilize the effect of recommending popular items to the user. Prior research has studied the negative impact of this type of bias on individuals and society as a whole and proposed various approaches to mitigate this in various domains. However, almost all works adopted offline methodologies to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Unfortunately, such offline simulations can potentially be rather simplified and unable to capture the full picture. To contribute to this line of research and given a particular lack of knowledge about how debiasing approaches work not only offline, but online as well, we present in this paper the results of user study on a national broadcaster movie streaming platform in [country]1, i.e., [platform], following the A/B testing methodology. We deployed an effective mitigation approach for popularity bias, called Calibrated Popularity (CP), and monitored its performance in comparison to the platform’s existing collaborative filtering recommendation approach as a baseline over a period of almost four months. The results obtained from a large user base interacting in real-time with the recommendations indicate that the evaluated debiasing approach can be effective in addressing popularity bias while still maintaining the level of user interest and engagement

  LBR  How Users Ride the Carousel: Exploring the Design of Multi-List Recommender Interfaces From a User Perspective  
  by Benedikt Loepp (University of Duisburg-Essen) and Jürgen Ziegler (University of Duisburg-Essen). | Multi-list interfaces are widely used in recommender systems, especially in industry, showing collections of recommendations, one below the other, with items that have certain commonalities. The composition and order of these “carousels” are usually optimized by simulating user interaction based on probabilistic models learned from item click data. Research that actually involves users is rare, with only few studies investigating general user experience in comparison to conventional recommendation lists. Hence, it is largely unknown how specific design aspects such as carousel type and length influence the individual perception and usage of carousel-based interfaces. This paper seeks to fill this gap through an exploratory user study. The results confirm previous assumptions about user behavior and provide first insights into the differences in decision making in the presence of multiple recommendation carousels.

  LBR  Integrating Item Relevance in Training Loss for Sequential Recommender Systems  
  by Andrea Bacciu (Sapienza University of Rome), Federico Siciliano (Sapienza University of Rome), Nicola Tonellotto (University of Pisa) and Fabrizio Silvestri (University of Rome). | Sequential Recommender Systems (SRSs) are a popular type of recommender system that leverages user history to predict the next item of interest. However, the presence of noise in user interactions, stemming from account sharing, inconsistent preferences, or accidental clicks, can significantly impact the robustness and performance of SRSs, particularly when the entire item set to be predicted is noisy. This situation is more prevalent when only one item is used to train and evaluate the SRSs. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel approach that addresses the issue of noise in SRSs. First, we propose a sequential multi-relevant future items training objective, leveraging a loss function aware of item relevance, thereby enhancing their robustness against noise in the training data. Additionally, to mitigate the impact of noise at evaluation time, we propose multi-relevant future items evaluation (MRFI-evaluation), aiming to improve overall performance. Our relevance-aware models obtain an improvement of ~1.58\% of NDCG@10 and 0.96\% in terms of HR@10 in the traditional evaluation protocol, the one which utilizes one relevant future item. In the MRFI-evaluation protocol, using multiple future items, the improvement is ~2.82\% of NDCG@10 and ~0.64\% of HR@10 w.r.t the best baseline model.

  LBR  Integrating Offline Reinforcement Learning with Transformers for Sequential Recommendation  
  by Xumei Xi (Cornell University), Yuke Zhao (Bloomberg LP), Quan Liu (Bloomberg), Liwen Ouyang (Bloomberg) and Yang Wu (Independent Researcher). | We consider the problem of sequential recommendation, where the current recommendation is made based on past interactions. This recommendation task requires efficient processing of the sequential data and aims to provide recommendations that maximize the long-term reward. To this end, we train a farsighted recommender by using an offline RL algorithm with the policy network in our model architecture that has been initialized from a pre-trained transformer model. The pre-trained model leverages the superb ability of the transformer to process sequential information. Compared to prior works that rely on online interaction via simulation, we focus on implementing a fully offline RL framework that is able to converge in a fast and stable way. Through extensive experiments on public datasets, we show that our method is robust across various recommendation regimes, including e-commerce and movie suggestions. Compared to state-of-the-art supervised learning algorithms, our algorithm yields recommendations of higher quality, demonstrating the clear advantage of combining RL and transformers.

  LBR  Learning the True Objectives of Multiple Tasks in Sequential Behavior Modeling  
  by Jiawei Zhang (Peking University). | Multi-task optimization is an emerging research field in recommender systems that focuses on improving the recommendation performance of multiple tasks. Various methods have been proposed in the past to address task weight balancing, gradient conflict resolution, Pareto optimality, etc, yielding promising results in specific contexts. However, when it comes to real-world scenarios involving user sequential behaviors, these methods are not well suited. To address this gap, we propose AcouRec, a novel and effective approach for sequential behavior modeling in multi-task recommender systems inspired by acoustic attenuation. Specifically, AcouRec introduces an impact attenuation mechanism to mitigate the uncertain task interference in multi-task optimization. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AcouRec.

  LBR  Leveraging Large Language Models for Sequential Recommendation  
  by Jesse Harte (Delivery Hero SE), Wouter Zorgdrager (Delivery Hero SE), Panos Louridas (Athens University of Economics & Business), Asterios Katsifodimos (Delft University of Technology), Dietmar Jannach (University of Klagenfurt) and Marios Fragkoulis (Delivery Hero SE). | Sequential recommendation problems have received increasing attention in research during the past few years, leading to the inception of a large variety of algorithmic approaches. In this work, we explore how large language models (LLMs), which are nowadays introducing disruptive effects in many AI-based applications, can be used to build or improve sequential recommendation approaches. Specifically, we devise and evaluate three approaches to leverage the power of LLMs in different ways. Our results from experiments on two datasets show that initializing the state-of-the-art sequential recommendation model BERT4Rec with embeddings obtained from an LLM improves NDCG by 15-20% compared to the vanilla BERT4Rec model. Furthermore, we find that a simple approach that leverages LLM embeddings for producing recommendations, can provide competitive performance by highlighting semantically related items. We publicly share the code and data of our experiments to ensure reproducibility.

  LBR  On the Consistency, Discriminative Power and Robustness of Sampled Metrics in Offline Top-N Recommender System Evaluation  
  by Yang Liu (University of Helsinki), Alan Medlar (University of Helsinki) and Dorota Glowacka (University of Helsinki). | Negative item sampling in offline top-n recommendation evaluation has become increasingly wide-spread, but remains controversial. While several studies have warned against using sampled evaluation metrics on the basis of being a poor approximation of the full ranking (i.e.~using all negative items), others have highlighted their improved discriminative power and potential to make evaluation more robust. Unfortunately, empirical studies on negative item sampling are based on relatively few methods (between 3-12) and, therefore, lack the statistical power to assess the impact of negative item sampling in practice.  
 In this article, we present preliminary findings from a comprehensive benchmarking study of negative item sampling based on 52 recommendation algorithms and 3 benchmark data sets. We show how the number of sampled negative items and different sampling strategies affect the consistency and discriminative power of sampled evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of sparsity bias and popularity bias on the robustness of these metrics. In brief, we show that the optimal parameterizations for negative item sampling are dependent on data set characteristics and the goals of the investigator, suggesting a need for greater transparency in related experimental design decisions.

  LBR  OutRank: Speeding up AutoML-based Model Search for Large Sparse Data sets with Cardinality-aware Feature Ranking  
  by Blaž Škrlj (Outbrain) and Blaž Mramor (Outbrain). | The design of modern recommender systems relies on understanding which parts of the feature space are relevant for solving a given recommendation task. However, real-world data sets in this domain are often characterized by their large size, sparsity, and noise, making it challenging to identify meaningful signals. Feature ranking represents an efficient branch of algorithms that can help address these challenges by identifying the most informative features and facilitating the automated search for more compact and better-performing models (AutoML). We introduce OutRank, a system for versatile feature ranking and data quality-related anomaly detection. OutRank was built with categorical data in mind, utilizing a variant of mutual information that is normalized with regard to the noise produced by features of the same cardinality. We further extend the similarity measure by incorporating information on feature similarity and combined relevance. The proposed approach’s feasibility is demonstrated by speeding up the state-of-the-art AutoML system on a synthetic data set with no performance loss. Furthermore, we considered a real-life click-through-rate prediction data set where it outperformed strong baselines such as random forest-based approaches. The proposed approach enables exploration of up to 300% larger feature spaces compared to AutoML-only approaches, enabling faster search for better models on off-the-shelf hardware.

  by Ergun Biçici (Huawei R&D Center Turkey). | Loss functions guide machine learning models towards concentrating on the error most important to improve upon. We introduce power loss functions for neural networks and apply them on imbalanced click-through rate datasets. Power loss functions decrease the loss for confident predictions and increase the loss for error-prone predictions. They improve both AUC and F1 and produce better calibrated results. We obtain improvements in the results on four different classifiers and on two different datasets. We obtain significant improvements in AUC that reach $0.44\%$ for DeepFM on the Avazu dataset.

However, many existing food recommendation systems have overlooked the important aspect of considering the health and nutritional value of recommended foods, thereby limiting their effectiveness in generating truly healthy recommendations. Our preliminary analysis indicates that users tend to respond positively to unhealthy food and recipes. As a result, existing food recommender systems that neglect health considerations often assign high scores to popular items, inadvertently encouraging unhealthy choices among users. In this study, we propose the development of a fairness-based model that prioritizes health considerations. Our model incorporates fairness constraints from both the user and item perspectives, integrating them into a joint objective framework. Experimental results conducted on real-world food datasets demonstrate that the proposed system not only maintains the ability of food recommendation systems to suggest users’ favorite foods but also improves the health factor compared to unfair models, with an average enhancement of approximately 35%.

  LBR  Turning Dross Into Gold Loss: is BERT4Rec really better than SASRec?  
  by Anton Klenitskiy (Sber, AI Lab) and Alexey Vasilev (Sber, AI Lab). | Recently sequential recommendations and next-item prediction task has become increasingly popular in the field of recommender systems. Currently, two state-of-the-art baselines are Transformer-based models SASRec and BERT4Rec. Over the past few years, there have been quite a few publications comparing these two algorithms and proposing new state-of-the-art models. In most of the publications, BERT4Rec achieves better performance than SASRec. But BERT4Rec uses cross-entropy over softmax for all items, while SASRec uses negative sampling and calculates binary cross-entropy loss for one positive and one negative item. In our work, we show that if both models are trained with the same loss, which is used by BERT4Rec, then SASRec will significantly outperform BERT4Rec both in terms of quality and training speed. In addition, we show that SASRec could be effectively trained with negative sampling and still outperform BERT4Rec, but the number of negative examples should be much larger than one.

  LBR  Uncertainty-adjusted Inductive Matrix Completion with Graph Neural Networks  
  by Petr Kasalicky (Singapore Management University, School of Computing and Information Systems), Antoine Ledent (Singapore Management University, School of Computing and Information Systems) and Rodrigo Alves (Czech Technical University, Faculty of Information Technology). | We propose a robust recommender systems model which performs matrix completion and a ratings-wise uncertainty estimation jointly. Whilst the prediction module is purely based on an implicit low-rank assumption imposed via nuclear norm regularization, our loss function is augmented by an uncertainty estimation module which learns an anomaly score for each individual rating via a Graph Neural Network: data points deemed more anomalous by the GNN are downregulated in the loss function used to train the low-rank module. The whole model is trained in an end-to-end fashion, allowing the anomaly detection module to tap on the supervised information available in the form of ratings. Thus, our model’s predictors enjoy the favourable generalization properties that come with being chosen from small function space (i.e., low-rank matrices), whilst exhibiting the robustness to outliers and flexibility that comes with deep learning methods. Furthermore, the anomaly scores themselves contain valuable qualitative information. Experiments on various real-life datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms standard matrix completion and other baselines, confirming the usefulness of the anomaly detection module.

  LBR  Uncovering ChatGPT’s Capabilities in Recommender Systems  
  by Sunhao Dai (Renmin University of China), Ninglu Shao (Renmin University of China), Haiyuan Zhao (Renmin University of China), Weijie Yu (University of International Business and Economics), Zihua Si (Renmin University of China), Chen Xu (Renmin University of China), Zhongxiang Sun (Renmin University of China), Xiao Zhang (Renmin University of China) and Jun Xu (Renmin University of China). | The debut of ChatGPT has recently attracted significant attention from the natural language processing (NLP) community and beyond. Existing studies have demonstrated that ChatGPT shows significant improvement in a range of downstream NLP tasks, but the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT in terms of recommendations remain unclear. In this study, we aim to enhance ChatGPT’s recommendation capabilities by aligning it with traditional information retrieval (IR) ranking capabilities, including point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise ranking. To achieve this goal, we re-formulate the aforementioned three recommendation policies into prompt formats tailored specifically to the domain at hand. Through extensive experiments on four datasets from different domains, we analyze the distinctions among the three recommendation policies. Our findings indicate that ChatGPT achieves an optimal balance between cost and performance when equipped with list-wise ranking. This research sheds light on a promising direction for aligning ChatGPT with recommendation tasks.

 DEM  EasyStudy: Framework for Easy Deployment of User Studies on Recommender Systems  
  by Patrik Dokoupil (Department of Software Engineering, Charles University) and Ladislav Peska (Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University, Prague, Czechia). | Improvements in the recommender systems (RS) domain are not possible without a thorough way to evaluate and compare newly proposed approaches. User studies represent a viable alternative to online and offline evaluation schemes, but despite their numerous benefits, they are only rarely used. One of the main reasons behind this fact is that preparing a user study from scratch involves a lot of extra work on top of a simple algorithm proposal. To simplify this task, we propose \textsc{EasyStudy}, a modular framework built on the credo “\textit{Make simple things fast and hard things possible}”. It features ready-to-use datasets, preference elicitation methods, incrementally tuned baseline algorithms, study flow plugins, and evaluation metrics. As a result, a simple study comparing several RS can be deployed with just a few clicks, while more complex study designs can still benefit from a range of reusable components, such as preference elicitation. Overall, \textsc{EasyStudy} dramatically decreases the gap between the laboriousness of offline evaluation vs. user studies and, therefore, may contribute towards the more reliable and insightful user-centric evaluation of next-generation RS.

  DEM  Improving Group Recommendations using Personality, Dynamic Clustering and Multi-Agent MicroServices  
  by Patrícia Alves (GECAD/LASI – ISEP, Polytechnic of Porto), André Martins (GECAD/LASI – ISEP, Polytechnic of Porto), Paulo Novais (ALGORITMI/LASI, University of Minho) and Goreti Marreiros (GECAD/LASI, ISEP, Polytechnic of Porto). | The complexity associated to group recommendations needs strategies to mitigate several problems, such as the group’s heterogeinity and conflicting preferences, the emotional contagion phenomenon, the cold-start problem, and the group members’ needs and concerns while providing recommendations that satisfy all members at once. In this demonstration, we show how we implemented a Multi-Agent Microservice to represent the tourists in a mobile Group Recommender System for Tourism prototype. A novel dynamic clustering process is presented to help minimize the group’s heterogeneity and conflicting preferences. To help solve the cold-start problem, the preliminary tourist attractions preference and travel-related preferences & concerns are predicted using the tourists’ personality, while taking the tourists’ disabilities and fears into account. Although there is no need for previous interactions data to build the tourists’ profile since we predict the tourists’ preferences, the tourist agents learn with each other by using association rules to find patterns in the tourists’ profile and in the ratings given to Points of Interest to refine the recommendations.

  DEM  Introducing LensKit-Auto, an Experimental Automated Recommender System (AutoRecSys) Toolkit  
  by Tobias Vente (University of Siegen), Michael Ekstrand (Boise State University) and Joeran Beel (University of Siegen). | LensKit is one of the first and most popular Recommender System Libraries. While LensKit offers a wide variety of features, it does not include any optimization strategies or guidelines on how to select and tune LensKit algorithms. LensKit developers have to manually include third-party libraries into their experimental setup or implement optimization strategies by hand to optimize hyperparameters. We found that 65.5% (19 out of 29) of papers using LensKit algorithms for their experiments did not select algorithms or tune hyperparameters. Non-optimized models represent poor baselines and produce less meaningful research results. This demo introduces LensKit-Auto. LensKit-Auto automates the entire Recommender System pipeline and enables LensKit developers to automatically select, optimize, and ensemble LensKit algorithms.

  DEM  LLM Based Generation of Item-Description for Recommendation System  
  by Arkadeep Acharya (Sony Research India), Brijraj Singh (Sony Research India) and Naoyuki Onoe (Sony Research India). | The description of an item plays a pivotal role in providing concise and informative summaries to captivate potential viewers and is essential for recommendation systems. Traditionally, such descriptions were obtained through manual web scraping techniques, which are time-consuming and susceptible to data inconsistencies. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3.5, and open source LLMs like Alpaca have emerged as powerful tools for natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we have explored how we can use LLMs to generate detailed descriptions of the items. To conduct the study, we have used the MovieLens 1M dataset comprising movie titles and the Goodreads Dataset consisting of names of books and subsequently, an open-sourced LLM, Alpaca, was prompted with few-shot prompting on this dataset to generate detailed movie descriptions considering multiple features like the names of the cast and directors for the ML dataset and the names of the author and publisher for the Goodreads dataset. The generated description was then compared with the scraped descriptions using a combination of Top Hits, MRR, and NDCG as evaluation metrics. The results demonstrated that LLM-based movie description generation exhibits significant promise, with results comparable to the ones obtained by web-scraped descriptions.

  DEM  Localify.org: Locally-focus Music Artist and Event Recommendation  
  by Douglas Turnbull (Ithaca College), April Trainor (Ithaca College), Griffin Homan (Ithaca College), Elizabeth Richards (Ithaca College), Kieran Bentley (Ithaca College), Victoria Conrad (Ithaca College), Paul Gagliano (Ithaca College) and Cassandra Raineault (Ithaca College). | Cities with strong local music scenes enjoy many social and economic benefits. To this end, we are interested in developing a locally-focused artist and event recommendation system called Localify.org that supports and promotes local music scenes. Local artists tend to be relatively obscure and reside in the long tail of the artist’s popularity distribution. In this demo paper, we describe both the overall system architecture as well as our core recommender system that uses artist-artist similarity information as opposed to user-artist preference information. We also discuss the role of popularity bias and how we attempt to ameliorate it in the context of local music recommendation.

  DEM  Re2Dan: Retrieval of medical documents for e-Health in Danish  
  by Antonela Tommasel (ISISTAN Research Institute, CONICET-UNCPBA), Rafael Pablos (Aarhus Universitet) and Ira Assent (Aarhus Universitet). | With the clinical environment becoming more data-reliant, healthcare professionals now have unparalleled access to comprehensive clinical information from numerous sources. Then, one of the main issues is how to avoid overloading practitioners with large amounts of (irrelevant) information while guiding them to the relevant documents for specific patient cases. Additional challenges appear due to the shortness of queries and the presence of long (and maybe noisy) contextual information. This demo presents Re2Dan, a web Retrieval and recommender of Danish medical documents. Re2Dan leverages several techniques to improve the quality of retrieved documents. First, it combines lexical and semantic searches to understand the meaning and context of user queries, allowing the retrieval of documents that are conceptually similar to the user’s query. Second, it recommends similar queries, allowing users to discover related documents and insights. Third, when given contextual information (e.g., from patients’ clinical notes), it suggests medical concepts to expand the user query, enabling a more focused search scope and thus obtaining more accurate recommendations. Preliminary analyses showed the effectiveness of the recommender in improving the relevance and comprehensiveness of recommendations, thereby assisting healthcare professionals in finding relevant information for informed decision-making.

 DS  Acknowledging dynamic aspects of trust in recommender systems  
  by Imane Akdim (School of Computer Science – Mohammed VI Polytechnic University). | Trust-based recommender systems emerged as a solution to different limitations of traditional recommender systems. These systems rely on the assumption that users will adopt the preferences of users they deem trustworthy in an online social setting. However, most trust-based recommender systems consider trust to be a static notion, thereby disregarding crucial dynamic factors that influence the value of trust between users and the performance of the recommender system. In this work, we intend to address several challenges regarding the dynamics of trust within a trust-based recommender system. These issues include the temporal evolution of trust between users and change detection and prediction in users’ interactions. By exploring the factors that influence the evolution of human trust, a complex and abstract concept, this work will contribute to a better understanding of how trust operates in recommender systems.

  DS  Advancing Automation of Design Decisions in Recommender System Pipelines  
  by Tobias Vente (University of Siegen). | Recommender systems have become essential in domains like streaming services, social media platforms, and e-commerce websites. However, the development of a recommender system involves a complex pipeline with preprocessing, data splitting, algorithm and model selection, and postprocessing stages, requiring critical design decisions. Every stage of the recommender systems pipeline requires design decisions that influence the performance of the recommender system. To ease design decisions, automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques have been adapted to the field of recommender systems, resulting in various AutoRecSys libraries. Nevertheless, these libraries lack library independence and limit flexibility in integrating automation techniques from different sources. In response, our research aims to enhance the usability of AutoML techniques for design decisions in recommender system pipelines. We focus on developing flexible and library-independent automation techniques for algorithm selection, model selection, and postprocessing steps. By enabling developers to make informed choices and ease the recommender system development process, we decrease the developer’s effort while improving the performance of the recommender systems. Moreover, we want to analyze the cost-to-benefit ratio of automation techniques in recommender systems, evaluating the computational overhead and the resulting improvements in predictive performance. Our objective is to leverage AutoML concepts to automate design decisions in recommender system pipelines, reduce manual effort, and enhance the overall performance and usability of recommender systems.

  DS  Challenges for Anonymous Session-Based Recommender Systems in Indoor Environments  
  by Alessio Ferrato (Roma TRE). | Recommender Systems (RSs) have gained widespread popularity for providing personalized recommendations in manifold domains. However, considering the growing user privacy concerns, the development of recommender systems that prioritize data protection has become increasingly important. In indoor environments, RSs face unique challenges, and ongoing research is being conducted to address them. Anonymous Session-Based Recommender Systems (ASBRSs) can represent a possible solution to address these challenges while ensuring user privacy. This paper aims to bridge the gap between existing RS research and the demand for privacy-preserving recommender systems, especially in indoor settings, where significant research efforts are underway. Therefore, it proposes three research questions: How does user modeling based on implicit feedback impact on ASBRSs, considering different embedding extraction networks? How can short sessions be leveraged to start the recommendation process in ASBRSs? To what extent can ASBRSs generate fair recommendations? By investigating these questions, this study establishes the foundations for applying ASBRSs in indoor environments, safeguarding user privacy, and contributing to the ongoing research in this field.

  DS  Complementary Product Recommendation for Long-tail Products  
  by Rastislav Papso (Kempelen Institute of Intelligent Technologies). | Identifying complementary relations between products plays a key role in e-commerce Recommender Systems (RS). Existing methods in Complementary Product Recommendation (CPR), however, focus only on identifying complementary relations in huge and data-rich catalogs, while none of them considers real-world scenarios of small and medium e-commerce platforms with limited number of interactions. In this paper, we discuss our research proposal that addresses the problem of identifying complementary relations in such sparse settings. To overcome the data sparsity problem, we propose to first learn complementary relations in large and data-rich catalogs and then transfer learned knowledge to small and scarce ones. To be able to map individual products across different catalogs and thus transfer learned relations between them, we propose to create Product Universal Embedding Space (PUES) using textual and visual product meta-data, which serves as a common ground for the products from arbitrary catalog.

  DS  Demystifying Recommender Systems: A Multi-faceted Examination of Explanation Generation, Impact, and Perception  
  by Giacomo Balloccu (Università degli Studi di Cagliari). | Recommender systems have become an integral component of the digital landscape, impacting a multitude of services and industries ranging from e-commerce to entertainment and beyond. By offering personalised suggestions, these systems challenge a fundamental problem in our modern information society named information overload. As users face a deluge of choices, recommender systems help sift through this immense sea of possibilities, delivering a personalised subset of options that align with user preferences and historical behaviour.  
 However, despite their considerable utility, recommender systems often operate as “black boxes,” obscuring the rationale behind recommendations. This opacity can engender mistrust and undermine user engagement, thus attenuating the overall effectiveness of the system. Researchers have emphasized the importance of explanations in recommender systems, highlighting how explanations can enhance system transparency, foster user trust, and improve decision-making processes, thereby enriching user experiences and yielding potential business benefits. Yet, a significant gap persists in the current state of human-understandable explanations research. While recommender systems have grown increasingly complex, our capacity to generate clear, concise, and relevant explanations that reflect this complexity remains limited. Crafting explanations that are both understandable and reflective of sophisticated algorithmic decision-making processes poses a significant challenge, especially in a manner that meets the user’s cognitive and contextual needs.

  DS  Denoising Explicit Social Signals for Robust Recommendation  
  by Youchen Sun (Nanyang Technological University). | Social recommender system assumes that user’s preferences can be influenced by their social connections. However, social networks are inherently noisy and contain redundant signals that are not helpful or even harmful for the recommendation task. In this extended abstract, we classify the noise in the explicit social links into intrinsic noise and extrinsic noise. Intrinsic noises are those edges that are natural in the social network but do not have an influence on the user preference modeling; Extrinsic noises, on the other hand, are those social links that are introduced intentionally through malicious attacks such that the attackers can manipulate the social influence to bias the recommendation outcome. To tackle this issue, we first propose a denoising framework that utilizes the information bottleneck principle and contrastive learning to filter out the noisy social edges and use the edges that are socially influential to enhance item prediction. Experiments will be conducted on the real-world datasets for the Top-K ranking evaluation as well as the model’s robustness to simulated social noises. Finally, we discuss the future plan about how to defend against extrinsic noise, which results from the malicious attack.

Given the escalating demand for interpretability, current research endeavors in the domain of GNNs for Recommender Systems (RecSys) necessitate the development of explainer methodologies to elucidate the decision-making process underlying GNN-based recommendations. In this work, we aim to present our research focused on techniques to extend beyond the existing approaches for addressing interpretability in GNN-based RecSys.

  DS  Exploring Unlearning Methods to Ensure the Privacy, Security, and Usability of Recommender Systems  
  by Jens Leysen (University of Antwerp). | Machine learning algorithms have proven highly effective in analyzing large amounts of data and identifying complex patterns and relationships. One application of machine learning that has received significant attention in recent years is recommender systems, which are algorithms that analyze user behavior and other data to suggest items or content that a user may be interested in. However useful, these systems may unintentionally retain sensitive, outdated, or faulty information. Posing a risk to user privacy, system security, and limiting a system’s usability. In this research proposal, we aim to address these challenges by investigating methods for machine “unlearning”, which would allow information to be efficiently “forgotten” or “unlearned” from machine learning models. The main objective of this proposal is to develop the foundation for future machine unlearning methods. We first evaluate current unlearning methods and explore novel adversarial attacks on these methods’ verifiability, efficiency, and accuracy to gain new insights and further develop the theory of machine unlearning. Using our gathered insights, we seek to create novel unlearning methods that are verifiable, efficient, and limit unnecessary accuracy degradation. Through this research, we seek to make significant contributions to the theoretical foundations of machine unlearning while also developing unlearning methods that can be applied to real-world problems.

  DS  Improving Recommender Systems Through the Automation of Design Decisions  
  by Lukas Wegmeth (University of Siegen). | Recommender systems developers are constantly faced with difficult design decisions. Additionally, the number of options that a recommender systems developer has to consider continually grows over time with new innovations. The machine learning community is in a similar situation and has come together to tackle the problem. They invented concepts and tools to make machine learning development both easier and faster. These developments are categorized as automated machine learning (AutoML). As a result, the AutoML community formed and continuously innovates new approaches. Inspired by AutoML, the recommender systems community has recently understood the need for automation and sparsely introduced AutoRecSys. The goal of AutoRecSys is not to replace recommender systems developers but to improve performance through the automation of design decisions. With AutoRecSys, recommender systems engineers do not have to focus on easy but time-consuming tasks and are free to pursue difficult engineering tasks instead. Additionally, AutoRecSys enables easier access to recommender systems for beginners as it reduces the amount of knowledge required to get started with the development of recommender systems. AutoRecSys, like AutoML, is still early in its development and does not yet cover the whole development pipeline. Additionally, it is not yet clear, under which circumstances AutoML approaches can be transferred to recommender systems. Our research intends to close this gap by improving AutoRecSys both with regard to the transfer of AutoML and novel approaches. Furthermore, we focus specifically on the development of novel automation approaches for data processing and training. We note that the realization of AutoRecSys is going to be a community effort. Our part in this effort is to research AutoRecSys fundamentals, build practical tools for the community, raise awareness of the advantages of automation, and catalyze AutoRecSys development.

  DS  Knowledge-Aware Recommender Systems based on Multi-Modal Information Sources  
  by Giuseppe Spillo (University of Bari ‘Aldo Moro’). | The last few years saw a growing interest in Knowledge-Aware Recommender Systems (KARSs), given their capability in encoding and exploiting several data sources, both structured (such as \textit{knowledge graphs}) and unstructured (such as plain text); indeed, several pieces of research show the competitiveness of these models. Nowadays, a lot of models at the state-of-the-art in KARSs use deep learning, enabling them to exploit large amounts of information, including knowledge graphs (KGs), user reviews, plain text, and multimedia content (pictures, audio, videos). In my Ph.D. I will explore and study techniques for designing KARSs leveraging embeddings deriving from multi-modal information sources; the models I will design will aim at providing fair, accurate, and explainable recommendations.

  DS  Overcoming Recommendation Limitations with Neuro-Symbolic Integration  
  by Tommaso Carraro (University of Padova / Fondazione Bruno Kessler). | Despite being studied for over twenty years, Recommender Systems (RSs) still suffer from important issues that limit their applicability in real-world scenarios. Data sparsity, cold start, and explainability are some of the most impacting problems. Intuitively, these historical limitations can be mitigated by injecting prior knowledge into recommendation models. Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) approaches are suitable candidates for achieving this goal. Specifically, they aim to integrate learning (e.g., neural networks) with symbolic reasoning (e.g., logical reasoning). Generally, the integration lets a neural model interact with a logical knowledge base, enabling reasoning capabilities. In particular, NeSy approaches have been shown to deal well with poor training data, and their symbolic component could enhance model transparency. This gives insights that NeSy systems could potentially mitigate the aforementioned RSs limitations. However, the application of such systems to RSs is still in its early stages, and most of the proposed architectures do not really exploit the advantages of a NeSy approach. To this end, we conducted preliminary experiments with a Logic Tensor Network (LTN), a novel NeSy framework. We used the LTN to train a vanilla Matrix Factorization model using a First-Order Logic knowledge base as an objective. In particular, we encoded facts to enable the regularization of the latent factors using content information, obtaining promising results. In this paper, we review existing NeSy recommenders, argue about their limitations, show our preliminary results with the LTN, and propose interesting future works in this novel research area. In particular, we show how the LTN can be intuitively used to regularize models, perform cross-domain recommendation, ensemble learning, and explainable recommendation, reduce popularity bias, and easily define the loss function of a model.

  DS  Retrieval-augmented Recommender System: Enhancing Recommender Systems with Large Language Models  
  by Dario Di Palma (Politecnico di Bari). | Recommender Systems (RSs) play a pivotal role in delivering personalized recommendations across various domains, from e-commerce to content streaming platforms. Recent advancements in natural language processing have introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) that exhibit remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. RS are renowned for their effectiveness and proficiency within clearly defined domains; nevertheless, they are limited in adaptability and incapable of providing recommendations for unexplored data. Conversely, LLMs exhibit contextual awareness and strong adaptability to unseen data. Combining these technologies creates a potent tool for delivering contextual and relevant recommendations, even in cold scenarios characterized by high data sparsity. The proposal aims to explore the possibilities of integrating LLMs into RS, introducing a novel approach called Retrieval-augmented Recommender Systems, which combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models to enhance the ability of RSs to provide relevant suggestions.

  DS  Sequential Recommendation Models: A Graph-based Perspective  
  by Andreas Peintner (University of Innsbruck). | Recommender systems (RecSys) traditionally leverage the users’ rich interaction data with the system, but ignore the sequential dependency of items. Sequential recommender systems aim to predict the next item the user will interact with (e.g., click on, purchase, or listen to) based on the preceding interactions of the user. Current state-of-the-art approaches focus on transformer-based architectures and graph neural networks. Specifically, the modeling of sequences as graphs has shown to be a promising approach to introduce a structured bias into the recommendation learning framework. In this work, we will outline our research of exploring different applications of graphs in sequential recommendation.

  DS  User-Centric Conversational Recommendation: Adapting the Need of User with Large Language Models  
  by Gangyi Zhang (University of Science and Technology of China). | Conversational recommender systems (CRS) promise to provide a more natural user experience for exploring and discovering items of interest through ongoing conversation. However, effectively modeling user preferences during conversations and generating personalized recommendations in real time remain challenging problems. Users often express their needs in a vague and evolving manner, and CRS must adapt to capture the dynamics and uncertainty in user preferences to have productive interactions.  
 This research develops user-centric methods for building conversational recommendation system that can understand complex and changing user needs. We propose a graph-based conversational recommendation framework that represents multi-turn conversations as reasoning over a user-item-attribute graph. Enhanced conversational path reasoning incorporates graph neural networks to improve representation learning in this framework. To address uncertainty and dynamics in user preferences, we present the vague preference multi-round conversational recommendation scenario and an adaptive vague preference policy learning solution that employs reinforcement learning to determine recommendation and preference elicitation strategies tailored to the user.  
 Looking to the future, large language models offer promising opportunities to enhance various aspects of CRS, including user modeling, policy learning, response generation. Overall, this research takes a user-centered perspective in designing conversational agents that can adapt to the inherent ambiguity involved in natural language dialogues with people.

 IND  Accelerating Creator Audience Building through Centralized Exploration  
  by Buket Baran (Spotify), Guilherme Dinis Junior (Spotify), Antonina Danylenko (Spotify), Olayinka S. Folorunso (Spotify), Gösta Forsum (Spotify), Maksym Lefarov (Spotify), Lucas Maystre (Spotify) and Yu Zhao (Spotify). | On Spotify, multiple recommender systems enable personalized user experiences across a wide range of product features. These systems are owned by different teams and serve different goals, but all of these systems need to explore and learn about new content as it appears on the platform. In this work, we describe ongoing efforts at Spotify to develop an efficient solution to this problem, by centralizing content exploration and providing signals to existing, decentralized recommendation systems (a.k.a. exploitation systems). We take a creator-centric perspective, and argue that this approach can dramatically reduce the time it takes for new content to reach its full potential.

  IND  An Industrial Framework for Personalized Serendipitous Recommendation in E-commerce  
  by Zongyi Wang (jd.com), Yanyan Zou (JD.com), Anyu Dai (jd.com), Linfang Hou (jd.com), Nan Qiao (jd.com), Luobao Zou (jd.com), Mian Ma (JD.com), Zhuoye Ding (JD.com) and Sulong Xu (JD). | Classical recommendation methods typically face the filter bubble problem where users likely receive recommendations of their familiar items, making them bored and dissatisfied. To alleviate such an issue, this applied paper introduces a novel framework for personalized serendipitous recommendation in an e-commerce platform (i.e., JD.com), which allows to present user unexpected and satisfying items deviating from user’s prior behaviors, considering both accuracy and novelty. To achieve such a goal, it is crucial yet challenging to recognize when a user is willing to receive serendipitous items and how many novel items are expected. To address above two challenges, a two-stage framework is designed. Firstly, a DNN-based scorer is deployed to quantify the novelty degree of a product category based on user behavior history. Then, we resort to a potential outcome framework to decide the optimal timing to recommend a user serendipitous items and the novelty degree of the recommendation. Online A/B test on the e-commerce recommender platform in JD.com demonstrates that our model achieves significant gains on various metrics, 0.54% relative increase of impressive depth, 0.8% of average user click count, 3.23% and 1.38% of number of novel impressive and clicked items individually.

  IND  Beyond Labels: Leveraging Deep Learning and LLMs for Content Metadata  
  by Saurabh Agrawal (Tubi), John Trenkle (Tubi) and Jaya Kawale (Tubi). | Content metadata plays a very important role in movie recommender systems as it provides valuable information about various aspects of a movie such as genre, cast, plot synopsis, box office summary, etc. Analyzing the metadata can help understand the user preferences and generate personalized recommendations catering to the niche tastes of the users. It can also help with content cold starting when the recommender system has little or no interaction data available to perform collaborative filtering. In this talk, we will focus on one particular type of metadata – genre labels. Genre labels associated with a movie or a TV series such as “horror” or “comedy” or “romance” help categorize a collection of movies into different themes and correspondingly setting up the audience expectation for a title. We present some of the challenges associated with using genre label information via traditional methods and propose a new way of examining the genre information that we call as the Genre Spectrum. The Genre Spectrum helps capture the various nuanced genres in a title and our offline and online experiments corroborate the effectiveness of the approach.

  by Yan Chen (Wayfair), Emilian Vankov (Wayfair), Linas Baltrunas (Netflix), Preston Donovan (Wayfair), Akash Mehta (Wayfair) and Benjamin Schroeder (Wayfair). | We present the use of a contextual multi-armed bandit approach to improve the personalization of marketing emails sent to Wayfair’s customers. Emails are a critical outreach tool as they economically unlock a significant amount of revenue. We describe how we formulated our problem of selecting the optimal personalized email layout to use as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem. We also explain how we approximated a solution with an Epsilon-greedy strategy. We detail the thorough evaluations we ran, including offline experiments, an off-policy evaluation, and an online A/B test. Our results demonstrate that our approach is able to select personalized email layouts that lead to significant gains in topline business metrics including engagement and conversion rates.

  IND  Efficient Data Representation Learning in Google-scale Systems  
  by Derek Cheng (Google DeepMind), Ruoxi Wang (Google DeepMind), Wang-Cheng Kang (Google DeepMind), Benjamin Coleman (Google DeepMind), Yin Zhang (Google DeepMind), Jianmo Ni (Google DeepMind), Jonathan Valverde (Google DeepMind), Lichan Hong (Google DeepMind) and Ed Chi (Google DeepMind). | Garbage in, Garbage out is a familiar maxim to ML practitioners and researchers, because the quality of a learned data representation is highly crucial to the quality of any ML model that consumes it as an input. To handle systems that serve billions of users at millions of queries per second (QPS), we need representation learning algorithms with significantly improved efficiency. At Google, we have dedicated thousands of iterations to develop a set of powerful techniques that efficiently learn high quality data representations.We have thoroughly validated these methods through offline evaluation, online A/B testing, and deployed these in over 50 models across major Google products. In this paper, we consider a generalized data representation learning problem that allows us to identify feature embeddings and crosses as common challenges. We propose two solutions, including: 1. Multi-size Unified Embedding to learn high-quality embeddings; and 2. Deep Cross Network V2 for learning effective feature crosses. We discuss the practical challenges we encountered and solutions we developed during deployment to production systems, compare with SOTA methods, and report offline and online experimental results. This work sheds light on the challenges and opportunities for developing next-gen algorithms for web-scale systems.

  IND  From Research to Production: Towards Scalable and Sustainable Neural Recommendation Models on Commodity CPU Hardware  
  by Vihan Lakshman (ThirdAI), Anshumali Shrivastava (Rice University/ThirdAI), Tharun Medini (ThirdAI), Nicholas Meisburger (ThirdAI Corp), Joshua Engels (ThirdAI), David Torres Ramos (ThirdAI), Benito Geordie (ThirdAI), Pratik Pranav (ThirdAI), Shubh Gupta (ThirdAI), Yashwanth Adunukota (ThirdAI) and Siddharth Jain (ThirdAI). | In the last decade, large-scale deep learning has fundamentally transformed industrial recommendation systems. However, this revolutionary technology remains prohibitively expensive due to the need for costly and scarce specialized hardware, such as GPUs, to train and serve models. In this talk, we share our multi-year journey at ThirdAI in developing efficient neural recommendation models that can be trained and deployed on commodity CPU machines without the need for costly accelerators like GPUs. In particular, we discuss the limitations of the current GPU-based ecosystem in machine learning, why recommendation systems are amenable to the strengths of CPU devices, and present results from our efforts to translate years of academic research into a deployable system that fundamentally shifts the economics of training and operating large-scale machine learning models.

  IND  Heterogeneous Knowledge Fusion: A Novel Approach for Personalized Recommendation via LLM  
  by Bin Yin (Meituan), Junjie Xie (Meituan), Yu Qin (Meituan), Zixiang Ding (Meituan), Zhichao Feng (Meituan), Xiang Li (Unaffiliated) and Wei Lin (Unaffiliated). | The analysis and mining of user heterogeneous behavior are of paramount importance in recommendation systems. However, the conventional approach of incorporating various types of heterogeneous behavior into recommendation models leads to feature sparsity and knowledge fragmentation issues. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach for personalized recommendation via Large Language Model (LLM), by extracting and fusing heterogeneous knowledge from user heterogeneous behavior information. In addition, by combining heterogeneous knowledge and recommendation tasks, instruction tuning is performed on LLM for personalized recommendations. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively integrate user heterogeneous behavior and significantly improve recommendation performance.

  IND  Identifying Controversial Pairs in Item-to-Item Recommendations  
  by Junyi Shen (Apple), Dayvid Rodrigues de Oliveira (Apple), Jin Cao (Apple), Brian Knott (Apple), Goodman Gu (Apple), Sindhu Vijaya Raghavan (Apple) and Rob Monarch (Apple). | Recommendation systems in large-scale online marketplaces are essential to aiding users in discovering new content. However, state-of-the-art systems for item-to-item recommendation tasks are often based on a shallow level of contextual relevance, which can make the system insufficient for tasks where item relationships are more nuanced. Contextually relevant item pairs can sometimes have controversial or problematic relationships, and they could degrade user experiences and brand perception when recommended to users. For example, a recommendation of a divorce and co-parenting book can create a disturbing experience for someone who is downloading or viewing a marriage therapy book. In this paper, we propose a classifier to identify and prevent such problematic item-to-item recommendations and to enhance overall user experiences. The proposed approach utilizes active learning to sample hard examples effectively across sensitive item categories and uses human raters for data labeling. We also perform offline experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of this system for identifying and filtering controversial recommendations while maintaining recommendation quality.

  IND  Investigating the effects of incremental training on neural ranking models  
  by Benedikt Schifferer (NVIDIA), Wenzhe Shi (ShareChat), Gabriel de Souza Pereira Moreira (NVIDIA), Even Oldridge (NVIDIA), Chris Deotte (NVIDIA), Gilberto Titericz (NVIDIA), Kazuki Onodera (NVIDIA), Praveen Dhinwa (ShareChat), Vishal Agrawal (ShareChat) and Chris Green (ShareChat). | Recommender systems are an essential component of online systems, providing users with a personalized experience. Some recommendation scenarios such as social networks or news are very dynamic, with new items added continuously and the interest of users changing over time due to breaking news or popular events. Incremental training is a popular technique to keep recommender models up-to-date in those dynamic platforms. In this paper, we provide an empirical analysis of a large industry dataset from the Sharechat app MOJ, a social media platform for short videos, to answer relevant questions like – how often should I retrain the model? – do different models, features and dataset sizes benefit from incremental training? – Do all users and items benefit the same from incremental training?

  IND  Learning From Negative User Feedback and Measuring Responsiveness for Sequential Recommenders  
  by Yueqi Wang (Google), Yoni Halpern (Google), Shuo Chang (Google), Jingchen Feng (Google), Elaine Ya Le (Google), Longfei Li (Google), Xujian Liang (Google), Min-Cheng Huang (Google), Shane Li (Google), Alex Beutel (Google), Yaping Zhang (Google) and Shuchao Bi (Google). | Sequential recommenders have been widely used in industry due to their strength in modeling user preferences. While these models excel at learning a user’s positive interests, less attention has been paid to learn from negative user feedback. Negative user feedback is an important lever of user control, and comes with an expectation that recommenders should respond quickly and reduce similar recommendations to the user. However, negative feedback signals are often ignored in the training objective of sequential recommenders, which primarily aim at predicting positive user interactions. In this work, we incorporate explicit and implicit negative user feedback into the training objective of sequential recommenders using a “not-to-recommend” loss function that optimizes for the log likelihood of not recommending items with negative feedback. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using live experiments on a large-scale industrial recommender system. Furthermore, we address a challenge in measuring recommender responsiveness to negative feedback by developing a counterfactual simulation framework to compare recommender responses between different user actions, showing improved responsiveness from the modeling change.

  by Natalia Chen (Peloton Interactive), Nganba Meetei (Peloton Interactive), Nilothpal Talukder (Peloton Interactive) and Alexey Zankevich (Peloton Interactive). | At Peloton, we constantly strive to improve the member experience by highlighting personalized content that speaks to each individual user. One area of focus is our landing page, the homescreen, consisting of numerous rows of class recommendations used to captivate our users and guide them through our growing catalog of workouts. In this paper, we discuss a strategy we have used to increase the rate of workouts started from our homescreen through a Thompson sampling approach to row ranking, enhanced further with a collaborative filtering method based on user similarity calculated from workout history.

  IND  LightSAGE: Graph Neural Networks for Large Scale Item Retrieval in Shopee’s Advertisement Recommendation  
  by Dang Minh Nguyen (Shopee, SEA Group), Chenfei Wang (Shopee, SEA Group), Yan Shen (Shopee, SEA Group) and Yifan Zeng (Shopee, SEA Group). | Graph Neural Network (GNN) is the trending solution for item retrieval in recommendation problems. Most recent reports, however, focus heavily on new model architectures. This may bring some gaps when applying GNN in the industrial setup, where, besides the model, constructing graph and handling data sparsity also play critical roles in the overall success of the project. In this work, we report how we apply GNN for large-scale e-commerce item retrieval at Shopee. We detail our simple yet novel and impactful techniques in graph construction, modeling, and handling data skewness. Specifically, we construct high-quality item graphs by combining strong-signal user behaviors with high-precision collaborative filtering (CF) algorithm. We then develop a new GNN architecture named LightSAGE to produce high-quality items’ embeddings for vector search. Finally, we develop multiple strategies to handle cold-start and long-tail items, which are critical in an advertisement (ads) system. Our models bring improvement in offline evaluations, online A/B tests, and are deployed to the main traffic of Shopee’s Recommendation Advertisement system.

  IND  Loss Harmonizing for Multi-Scenario CTR Prediction  
  by Congcong Liu (JD.com), Liang Shi (JD.com), Pei Wang (JD.com), Fei Teng (JD.com), Xue Jiang (JD.com), Changping Peng (JD.com), Zhangang Lin (JD.com) and Jingping Shao (JD.com). | Large-scale industrial systems often include multiple scenarios to satisfy diverse user needs. The common approach of using one model per scenario does not scale well and not suitable for minor scenarios with limited samples. An solution is to train a model on all scenarios, which can introduce domination and bias from the main scenario. MMoE-like structures have been proposed for multi-scenario prediction, but they do not explicitly address the issue of gradient unbalancing. This work proposes an adaptive loss harmonizing (ALH) algorithm for multi-scenario CTR prediction. It balances training by dynamically adjusting the learning speed, resulting in improved prediction performance. Experiments conducted on real production dataset and a rigorous A/B test prove the superiority of our method.

  IND  MCM: A Multi-task Pre-trained Customer Model for Personalization  
  by Rui Luo (Amazon), Tianxin Wang (Amazon), Jingyuan Deng (Amazon) and Peng Wan (Amazon). | Personalization plays a critical role in helping customers discover the products and contents they prefer for e-commerce stores.Personalized recommendations differ in contents, target customers, and UI. However, they require a common core capability – the ability to deeply understand customers’ preferences and shopping intents. In this paper, we introduce the MLCM (Multi-task Large pre-trained Customer Model), a large pre-trained BERT-based multi-task customer model with 10 million trainable parameters for e-commerce stores. This model aims to empower all personalization projects by providing commonly used preference scores for recommendations, customer embeddings for transfer learning, and a pre-trained model for fine-tuning. In this work, we improve the SOTA BERT4Rec framework to handle heterogeneous customer signals and multi-task training as well as innovate new data augmentation method that is suitable for recommendation task. Experimental results show that MLCM outperforms the original BERT4Rec by 17% on preference prediction tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate that the model can be easily fine-tuned to assist a specific recommendation task. For instance, after fine-tuning MLCM for an incentive based recommendation project, performance improves by 60% on the conversion prediction task and 25% on the click-through prediction task compared to the production baseline model.

  IND  Navigating the Feedback Loop in Recommender Systems: Insights and Strategies from Industry Practice  
  by Ding Tong (Netflix), Qifeng Qiao (Netflix), Ting-Po Lee (Netflix), James McInerney (Netflix) and Justin Basilico (Netflix). | Understanding and measuring the impact of feedback loops in industrial recommender systems is challenging, leading to the underestimation of the deterioration. In this study, we define open and closed feedback loops and investigate the unique reasons behind the emergence of feedback loops in the industry, drawing from real-world examples that have received limited attention in prior research. We highlight the measurement challenges associated with capturing the full impact of feedback loops using traditional online A/B tests. To address this, we propose the use of offline evaluation frameworks as surrogates for long-term feedback loop bias, supported by a practical simulation system using real data. Our findings provide valuable insights for optimizing the performance of recommender systems operating under feedback loop conditions.

  IND  Nonlinear Bandits Exploration for Recommendations  
  by Yi Su (Google) and Minmin Chen (Google). | The paradigm of framing recommendations as (sequential) decision-making processes has gained significant interest. To achieve long-term user satisfaction, these interactive systems need to strikes a balance between exploitation (recommending high-reward items) and exploration (exploring uncertain regions for potentially better items). Classical bandit algorithms like Upper-Confidence-Bound and Thompson Sampling, and their contextual extensions with linear payoffs have exhibited strong theoretical guarantees and empirical success in managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Building efficient exploration-based systems for deep neural network powered real-world, large-scale industrial recommender systems remains under studied. In addition, these systems are often multi-stage, multi-objective and response time sensitive. In this talk, we share our experience in addressing these challenges in building exploration based industrial recommender systems. Specifically, we adopt the Neural Linear Bandit algorithm, which effectively combines the representation power of deep neural networks, with the simplicity of linear bandits to incorporate exploration in DNN based recommender systems. We introduce exploration capability to both the nomination and ranking stage of the industrial recommender system. In the context of the ranking stage, we delve into the extension of this algorithm to accommodate the multi-task setup, enabling exploration in systems with multiple objectives. Moving on to the nomination stage, we will address the development of efficient bandit algorithms tailored to factorized bi-linear models. These algorithms play a crucial role in facilitating maximum inner product search, which is commonly employed in large-scale retrieval systems. We validate our algorithms and present findings from real-world live experiments.

  IND  Optimizing Podcast Discovery: Unveiling Amazon Music’s Retrieval and Ranking Framework  
  by Geetha Aluri (Amazon), Paul Greyson (Amazon) and Joaquin Delgado (Amazon). | This work presents the search architecture of Amazon Music, which is a highly efficient system designed to retrieve relevant content for users. The architecture consists of three key stages: indexing, retrieval, and ranking. During the indexing stage, data is meticulously parsed and processed to create a comprehensive index that contains dense representations and essential information about each document (such as a music or podcast entity) in the collection, including its title, metadata, and relevant attributes. This indexing process enables fast and efficient data access during retrieval. The retrieval stage utilizes multi-faceted retrieval strategies, resulting in improved identification of candidate matches compared to traditional structured search methods. Subsequently, candidates are ranked based on their relevance to the customer’s query, taking into account document features and personalized factors. With a specific focus on the podcast use case, this paper highlights the deployment of the architecture and demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing podcast search capabilities, providing tailored and engaging content experiences.

  IND  Personalised Recommendations for the BBC iPlayer: Initial approach and current challenges  
  by Benjamin R. Clark (British Broadcasting Corporation), Kristine Grivcova (British Broadcasting Corporation), Polina Proutskova (British Broadcasting Corporation) and Duncan M. Walker (British Broadcasting Corporation). | BBC iPlayer is one of the most important digital products of the BBC, offering live and on-demand television for audiences in the UK with over 10 million weekly active users. The BBC’s role as a public service broadcaster, broadcasting over traditional linear channels as well as online presents a number of challenges for a recommender system. In addition to having substantially different objectives to a commercial service, we show that the diverse content offered by the BBC including news and sport, factual, drama and live events lead to a catalogue with a diversity of consumption patterns, depending on genre. Our research shows that simple models represent strong baselines in this system. We discuss our initial attempts to improve upon these baselines, and conclude with our current challenges.

  IND  RecQR: Using Recommendation Systems for Query Reformulation to correct unseen errors in spoken dialog systems  
  by Manik Bhandari (Amazon.com), Mingxian Wang (Amazon), Oleg Poliannikov (Amazon) and Kanna Shimizu (Amazon). | As spoken dialog systems like Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant become widespread, it becomes apparent that relying solely on global, one-size-fits-all models of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Entity Resolution (ER), is inadequate for delivering a friction-less customer experience. To address this issue, Query Reformulation (QR) has emerged as a crucial technique for personalizing these systems and reducing customer friction. However, existing QR models, trained on personal rephrases in history face a critical drawback – they are unable to reformulate unseen queries to unseen targets. To alleviate this, we present RecQR, a novel system based on collaborative filters, designed to reformulate unseen defective requests to target requests that a customer may never have requested for in the past. RecQR anticipates a customer’s future requests and rewrites them using state of the art, large-scale, collaborative filtering and query reformulation models. Based on experiments we find that it reduces errors by nearly 40% (relative) on the reformulated utterances.

  IND  Reward innovation for long-term member satisfaction  
  by Gary Tang (Netflix), Jiangwei Pan (Netflix), Henry Wang (Netflix) and Justin Basilico (Netflix). | Many large-scale recommender systems train on engagements because of their data abundance, immediacy of feedback, and correlation to user preferences. At Netflix and many digital products, engagement is an imperfect proxy to the overall goal of long-term user satisfaction. One way we address this misalignment is via reward innovation. In this paper, we provide a high-level description of the problem and motivate our approach. Finally, we present some practical insights into this track of work including challenges, lessons learned, and systems we’ve built to support the effort.

  IND  Scaling Session-Based Transformer Recommendations using Optimized Negative Sampling and Loss Functions  
  by Timo Wilm (OTTO (GmbH & Co KG)), Philipp Normann (OTTO (GmbH & Co KG)), Sophie Baumeister (OTTO (GmbH & Co KG)) and Paul-Vincent Kobow (OTTO (GmbH & Co KG)). | This work introduces TRON, a scalable session-based Transformer Recommender using Optimized Negative-sampling. Motivated by the scalability and performance limitations of prevailing models such as SASRec and GRU4Rec+, TRON integrates top-k negative sampling and listwise loss functions to enhance its recommendation accuracy. Evaluations on relevant large-scale e-commerce datasets show that TRON improves upon the recommendation quality of current methods while maintaining training speeds similar to SASRec. A live A/B test yielded an 18.14% increase in click-through rate over SASRec, highlighting the potential of TRON in practical settings. For further research, we provide access to our source code and an anonymized dataset.

  IND  Station and Track Attribute-Aware Music Personalization  
  by M. Jeffrey Mei (SiriusXM Radio Inc.), Oliver Bembom (SiriusXM Radio Inc.) and Andreas Ehmann (SiriusXM Radio Inc.). | We present a transformer for music personalization that recommends tracks given a station seed (artist) and improves the accuracy vs. a baseline matrix factorization method by 10%. Adding more embeddings to capture track and station attributes further improves the accuracy of our recommendations, and also improves recommendation diversity, i.e. mitigates popularity bias. We analyze the learned embeddings and find they learn both explicit attributes provided at training and implicit attributes that may inform listener preferences. We also find that unlike matrix factorization, our model can identify and transfer relevant listener preferences across different genres and artists.

  IND  Towards Companion Recommenders Assisting Users’ Long-Term Journeys  
  by Konstantina Christakopoulou (Google) and Minmin Chen (Google). | Nowadays, with the abundance of the internet content, users expect the recommendation platforms to not only help them with one-off decisions and short-term tasks, but to also support their persistent and overarching interest journeys, including their real-life goals that last days, months or even years. In order for recommender systems to truly assist users through their real-life journeys, they need to first be able to understand and reason about interests, needs, and goals users want to pursue; and then plan taking those into account. However, the task presents several challenges. In this talk, we will present the key steps and elements needed to tackle the problem — particularly (1) user research for interest journeys; (2) personalized and interpretable user profiles; (3) adapting large language models, and other foundational models, for better user understanding; (4) better planning at a macro-level through reinforcement learning and reason-and-act conversational agents; (5) novel journey-powered front end user experiences, allowing for more user control. We hope that the talk will help inspire other researchers, and will pave the way towards companion recommenders that can truly assist the users throughout their interest journeys.

  IND  Track Mix Generation on Music Streaming Services using Transformers  
  by Walid Bendada (Deezer Research), Théo Bontempelli (Deezer Research), Mathieu Morlon (Deezer Research), Benjamin Chapus (Deezer Research), Thibault Cador (Deezer Research), Thomas Bouabça (Deezer Research) and Guillaume Salha-Galvan (Deezer Research). | This paper introduces Track Mix, a personalized playlist generation system released in 2022 on the music streaming service Deezer. Track Mix automatically generates “mix” playlists inspired by initial music tracks, allowing users to discover music similar to their favorite content. To generate these mixes, we consider a Transformer model trained on millions of track sequences from user playlists. In light of the growing popularity of Transformers in recent years, we analyze the advantages, drawbacks, and technical challenges of using such a model for mix generation on the service, compared to a more traditional collaborative filtering approach. Since its release, Track Mix has been generating playlists for millions of users daily, enhancing their music discovery experience on Deezer.

  IND  Transparently Serving the Public: Enhancing Public Service Media Values through Exploration  
  by Andreas Grün (ZDF) and Xenija Neufeld (Accso – Accelerated Solutions GmbH). | In the last few years, we have reportedly underlined the importance of the Public Service Media Remit for ZDF as a Public Service Media provider. Offering fair, diverse, and useful recommendations to users is just as important for us as being transparent about our understanding of these values, the metrics that we are using to evaluate their extent, and the algorithms in our system that produce such recommendations. This year, we have made a major step towards transparency of our algorithms and metrics describing them for a broader audience, offering the possibility for the audience to learn details about our systems and to provide direct feedback to us. Having the possibility to measure and track PSM metrics, we have started to improve our algorithms towards PSM values. In this work, we describe these steps and the results of actively debasing and adding exploration into our recommendations to achieve more fairness.

  IND  Unleash the Power of Context: Enhancing Large-Scale Recommender Systems with Context-Based Prediction Models  
  by Jan Hartman (Outbrain), Assaf Klein (Outbrain), Davorin Kopič (Outbrain) and Natalia Silberstein (Outbrain). | In this work, we introduce the notion of Context-Based Prediction Models. A Context-Based Prediction Model determines the probability of a user’s action (such as a click or a conversion) solely by relying on user and contextual features, without considering any specific features of the item itself. We have identified numerous valuable applications for this modeling approach, including training an auxiliary context-based model to estimate click probability and incorporating its prediction as a feature in CTR prediction models.Our experiments indicate that this enhancement brings significant improvements in offline and online business metrics while having minimal impact on the cost of serving. Overall, our work offers a simple and scalable, yet powerful approach for enhancing the performance of large-scale commercial recommender systems, with broad implications for the field of personalized recommendations.

  IND  Visual Representation for Capturing Creator Theme in Brand-Creator Marketplace  
  by Asnat Greenstein-Messica (Lightricks), Keren Gaiger (Lightricks), Sarel Duanis (Lightricks), Ravid Cohen (Lightricks) and Shaked Zychlinski (Lightricks). | Providing cold start recommendations in a brand-creator marketplace is challenging as brands’ preferences extend beyond the mere objects depicted in the creator’s content and encompass the creator’s individual theme consistently resonates across images shared on her social media profile. Furthermore, brands often use textual keywords to describe their campaign’s aesthetic appeal, with which creators must align. To address these challenges, we propose two methods: SAME (Same Account Media Embedding), a novel creator representation employing a Siamese network to capture the unique creator theme and OAAR (Object-Agnostic Adjective Representation), enabling filtering creators based on textual adjectives that relate to aesthetic qualities through zero-shot learning. These two methods utilize CLIP, a state-of-the-art language-image model, and improve it in addressing the aforementioned challenges.

  About 

 Call for papers   
 The ACM MobiCom conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions in the field of wireless networking and mobile computing. MobiCom solicits papers that address important research challenges and build practical working systems. Successful papers should propose novel ideas to attack such problems through rigorous analysis, system design and real-world measurement or deployment of mobile networks, systems and applications.  
   
  MobiCom’23 will emphasize novelty and creativity while, at the same time, taking a broader and more inclusive view of wireless and mobile systems research. On one hand, the more novel the concept, the harder it can be to fully develop or evaluate all its aspects. On the other hand the more practical and developed the system, the more simple and sometimes known techniques must be leveraged. The review process will take both cases into account as intellectual merit and novelty can be found in techniques, system designs, implementations, and applications. The review process will also favor papers that describe how the authors will provide access to well-documented datasets, modeling and/or simulation tools, and codebases to support the reproducibility of their methods as well as papers that highlight and discuss not only the significance but also the limitations of the work.  
   
  Unlike in previous years, MobiCom’23 will not have separate categories of challenge, experience, and verification papers. However, we do encourage the submission of experience papers as full papers that provide detailed technical insight into real-world deployments of novel technologies and systems. MobiCom'23 will also incorporate early notifications for papers rejected in round 1 and rebuttals as described below in more detail.

  Two Deadlines, Early Notification, Rebuttals, and One-shot Revision  
  
  MobiCom 2023 offers authors the option of two deadlines and keeps the one-shot revision process to enhance the timeliness and quality of the scientific results from the research community. Each paper will go through the same rigorous reviewing process as in previous MobiCom conferences. The review process for each deadline will involve two rounds. Papers that are not selected to proceed after the first round will receive an early notification, including reviews. After the second round of reviews, the reviews will be released to the authors and who will have one week to submit a rebuttal.  
   
  Rebuttals  
 MobiCom will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to the final consideration of the papers at the program committee meeting. Authors must limit their responses to (a) correcting factual errors in the reviews or (b) directly addressing questions posed by reviewers. Responses should be limited to clarifying the submitted work. In particular, responses must not include new experiments, new data, or new figures, describe additional work completed since submission or promise additional work to follow.  
   
  The submission of a rebuttal is optional. Rebuttals will be limited to a maximum of 1000 words submitted in the online submission form. It is worth noting that available reviews will be released at the above-mentioned times. However, additional reviews might be solicited or submitted after the rebuttal period.  
   
  Final decisions will be one of the following  
  
  Accept | : Accepted papers will be presented at the MobiCom conference and appear as part of the proceedings and the MobiCom website. Note all the papers in this category will initially be | conditionally accepted | . The papers that go through a successful | anonymous | shepherding process will eventually be accepted. 
  Reject | : Rejected after reviewed papers cannot be resubmitted until 11 months have passed since the last MobiCom deadline they were submitted to. We strongly encourage the authors to address reviewers' feedback before re-submitting the paper to MobiCom. 
  One-Shot-Revision | : Papers, where a revision is required, will be given specific action points and can be resubmitted for the | next | deadline. For such papers, the reviewers will articulate a maximum of three major changes/clarifications that they would like to see. After the resubmission, the paper will be evaluated based on whether the authors have properly addressed the reviewers’ requests. Unlike in the shepherding process, the requested action points may include running additional experiments that obtain specific results and could take more than 4-6 weeks. During this revision period, the paper is still considered under review to MobiCom and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration. 
   
  Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers  
 The authors of accepted MobiCom 2023 papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee that will assess how well the submitted artifacts support the work described in the accepted papers. Participation in Artifact Evaluation is voluntary and has no influence on the paper’s acceptance, but is strongly encouraged. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive badges printed on the papers themselves. Additional details on the Artifact Evaluation process can be found here.  
   
  Submission Instructions  
  
  All paper submissions will be handled electronically at the MobiCom ’23 paper submission website  . Authors should prepare a PDF version of their full paper. All submitted papers will be evaluated through a double-blind  reviewing process, with the identities of the authors withheld from the reviewers.  
   
  Before final submission, you are expected to make sure that your paper complies with the following requirements. Please do not violate these requirements with the aim of including additional material: ​submissions that violate the formatting requirements may not be reviewed​.  You can visually inspect a page-by-page report of your paper format using the same tool as the submission system via a separate ​ online form  . After the submission deadline, we will use the same tool to check the conformance of papers. The format checking tool uses heuristics and can make mistakes. The PC chairs will manually inspect and possibly reject those papers with evident format violations. However, no paper will be rejected due to format violations without being manually checked.  
   
  Any papers that do not adhere to the following guidelines may be immediately rejected:  
   
  Contain no more than | twelve (12) | single-spaced and numbered pages, including figures, tables, any appendices, and any other material, followed by as many pages as necessary for bibliographic references. Papers whose non-bibliographic content is longer than 12 pages will not be reviewed. 
  Font size no smaller than | 10 points | . 
  Double column format with each column having dimensions 9.25 inches x 3.33 inches, a space of 0.33 inches between the two columns, and with no more than 55 lines of text per column. 
  Fit properly on US letter-sized paper (8.5 inches by 11 inches). 
  Submissions must be in PDF (Portable Document Format) authors should ensure that they are compatible with Adobe Acrobat (English version). Any other formats including Postscript and MS-Word, will not be accepted. 
  Authors' names must not appear anywhere in the paper or in the PDF file. The PDF file must also not contain any embedded hyperlinks, as these may compromise reviewer anonymity. 
  Limit the file size to less than 15 MB: contact the PC chairs if you have a file larger than this limit. 
  You may find these templates  useful in complying with the above requirements. For Latex users, please use ​ \documentclass[sigconf,10pt]{acmart}​  . But as an author, you bear the final responsibility to verify (manually or through the above online paper checker) that your submission is format-compliant.  

  By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects.  Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
   
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  

  Submission Policy  
  
  In addition to the formatting requirements, all authors are ​expected to make sure that their paper complies with the following submission policies.  
   
  Previous Publications  
 We allow submissions that extend a previous work published as a poster demo, or workshop paper such as HotMobile or HotNets. However, in such case, the author(s) should (1) acknowledge their own previous workshop publication with an anonymous citation (e.g., "[7] Anonymized workshop paper") and (b) explain the differences between the MobiCom submission and the prior workshop paper (e.g. "This paper extends a prior workshop paper [7] and differs in the following aspects ..."). In addition, the online submission form will require authors to submit the deanonymized citation and a short explanation of the differences from the prior workshop paper. The PC will review such extended versions of previously-published workshop papers in accordance with the ACM Plagiarism Policy.  
   
  No Simultaneous Submissions  
 All submissions must describe original research not published or currently under review for another conference or journal. It is ACM policy ( ​ACM Author Rights and Publishing Policy, Prior Publication, and Simultaneous Submissions  ​) not to allow double submissions, where the same paper is submitted concurrently to more than one conference/journal. Any double submissions detected will be immediately rejected  from all conferences/journals involved.  
   
  The ACM policy on simultaneous submissions does not consider technical reports (including arXiv) to be concurrent publications or submissions.  
   
   Double-blind Submissions  
 All submissions will be evaluated through double-blind reviewing. Please do not violate this requirement by explicitly or implicitly leaking the identity of any co-author or institution. They include but not limited to the below requirements: Please be sure your name and affiliation do not appear on the paper or in the submitted PDF file. This means that before submission, you must remove from the paper the authors' names, authors' affiliations, acknowledgments of funding sources etc. 
  Please be cautious and careful how you refer to your own prior work in the paper. For example, do not describe your prior work with phrases like: | “In prior work[3], we presented a routing protocol that …” | Instead, refer to your work in the third person, such as | “In prior work, Smith[3] presented a routing protocol that …” | With this method, the full citation to Smith can still be given, such as | [3] Smith, J., "Analysis of … " | In particular, it is not acceptable to say | [3] Reference deleted for double-blind review. 
  Please avoid advertising the paper with the same or similar title on your webpage social media, or through large mailing lists. Authors may include links to websites that contain source code, tools, or other supplemental material. The link in the paper, however, must be anonymized. Reviewers are not obliged to review such supplementary materials and such links must not be used to provide additional text that does not fit within the 12-page limit of the paper. 
  Authors are allowed to give talks to restricted audiences on the work(s) submitted to MobiCom during the review. If you have posted or plan to post a non-anonymized version of your paper on a preprint server before the MobiCom decisions are made the submitted version must not refer to the non-anonymized version. MobiCom strongly discourages advertising the preprint on social media, personal web pages or in the press while under submission to MobiCom. Finally, any reviewer aware of the authorship of a specific submission, may not be allowed to review the paper, at the discretion of the PC chairs. 
  We will not review any paper that violates our double-blind policy.  
   
  Submissions will be kept confidential until accepted. Rejected submissions will be kept confidential permanently.  
   
   Conflict of Interest (CoI)  
 For a fair review process, program committee members who are COIs to any author of the submission will not review or participate in the discussion and decision-making of the submission. It is the author’s responsibility to mark COIs in the submission website.  
   
  We generally follow the ACM policy ( Conflict of Interest Policy for ACM Publications  ) and also add and extend rules on the specific relationships to explicitly define COIs of one submission at MobiCom ’23 as:  
  (1) any PC member who works/worked at the same organizational affiliation with any co-author in the last 24 months  or reasonably expected within the next 12 months  ;  
  (2) any PC member who has co-authored any book, article, report, abstract or paper with collaboration in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months;  
  (3) any PC member who has collaborated on projects, such as funded grants, research or others with any co-author in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months;  
  (4) any PC member who is/was the advisor or advisee of any co-author;  
  (5) any PC member who graduated from the same research group and/or was under the same advisor/supervisor/manager in the last 48 months;  
  (6) any PC member who is exposed to the full or partial authorship of the work being submitted here in any public or private channel (including but not limited to interview talks, campus visits, research discussion, conversations);  
  (7) any PC member who has a close personal friendship or business relationship beyond professional settings that could affect the review process with any co-author;  
  (8) others perceivable conflicts.  
   
  A potential COI must be identified at the submission and can be updated at any point during the review process, but when possible, potential conflicts should be determined before acceptance decisions are made.  
   
  The author(s) must identify every COI out of all PC members (including chairs) with any  author of the submission and indicate the type of conflict during the submission process. For other forms of conflicts (item 8), the authors must contact the program chairs and explain the perceived conflict.  
   
  Knowingly hiding or falsifying a stated COI, and knowingly and falsely asserting a COI — e.g., to prevent or alter peer-reviewing, to discourage appropriate reviewing, or to seek disadvantage of another — are both considered as a violation of this COI policy. We will return the violated submissions with no reviews.  
   
   Previous Submissions  
 In case of any similarity between a current submission and a submission that has been previously rejected at MobiCom or other relevant conferences within the last 12 months, the authors are requested to do the following in three cases: For a one-shot revision, please carefully follow the instructions on the notification. Along with the resubmission, the authors must report the major concerns and requested items from the reviewers of the previous submission and write a summary of how the authors have addressed them in the revision. Please ensure | your anonymity | is retained in this summary. 
  For submissions that have been recently rejected by MobiCom, it is | required | for the authors to do the same as in case 1. That is, please report the major concerns from the reviewers of the previous submission and write a summary of how the authors have addressed them in the current submission. Please ensure | your anonymity | is retained in this summary. 
  For submissions that have been previously rejected by a conference other than MobiCom (such as Mobisys, SIGCOMM, NSDI, SenSys, UbiComp, etc.), it is | strongly encouraged | , although not required, for the authors to do the same items as in case 2. That is, please report the major concerns from the reviewers of the previous submission and write a summary of how the authors have addressed them in the current submission. Please ensure your anonymity is retained in this summary. 
   
   Processes for Conditionally Accepted Papers  
  
  Anonymous and Rigorous Shepherding   
  Conditionally accepted papers will be shepherded through a review process by a TPC member. Based on the feedback written in the reviews, authors of shepherded papers will submit a revision of their paper to the shepherd. The shepherd will collaborate with the reviewers from TPC to review the revised paper and provide the authors with additional comments. Note that the shepherding process could last 4-6 weeks and the authors might be asked to produce new experimental results and/or add new material. When the shepherding process results in final acceptance, the authors will upload their camera-ready file to the submissions system.  
   
  Video Presentation   
  The authors of each accepted paper will be asked to submit a one-minute video to introduce the research presented in their paper to the general public. These videos will be placed on the conference website and conference YouTube channel up to two weeks before the conference. A selected set will be featured by the social media channels related to the conference.  
   
  Registration and Presentation   
  By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will register and attend the conference to present it.  

  Awards  
  
  All accepted regular  papers will be considered for the Best Paper Award  .

 Note #1:  The Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE)  Issue FSE 2025 seeks contributions through submissions in this track. Accepted papers will be invited for presentation at FSE 2025. Approval has been granted by ACM in July 2023. PACMSE will be the only proceedings where accepted research track papers will be published. Please check the FAQ  for details.  
 Note #2:  The steering committee has decided that starting from 2024 the conference name will be changed to ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE).  
 Note #3:  Based on the coordination among FSE, ICSE, and ASE steering committees, the FSE conference and submission dates have been moved earlier, similarly to FSE 2024 deadlines. The intention is for this schedule to remain stable in the years ahead and the conference and submission deadlines of the three large general software engineering conferences to be spread out throughout the year.  
 Note #4:  Submissions must follow the “ ACM Policy on Authorship  ” released April 20, 2023, which contains policy regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT. Please also check the ACM FAQ  which describes in what situations generative AI tools can be used (with or without acknowledgement).  
 Note #5:  The names and list of authors as well as the title in the camera-ready version cannot be modified from the ones in the submitted version unless there is explicit approval from the track chairs.  
 Note #6:  Submissions that are changing the required submission format to gain additional space will be desk rejected. Examples of changing format include removing the ACM Reference format and the permission to make digital or hard copy footnotes on the first page.  
 Tracks   
 This CFP refers to the Research Track of FSE 2025. For the remaining tracks, please check the specific calls on the website: https://conf.researchr.org/home/fse-2025   
 HOW TO SUBMIT   
 At the time of submission, each paper should have no more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references, using the following templates: Latex  or Word (Mac)  or Word (Windows)  . Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex  file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall  option. We also strongly encourage the use of the review, screen, and anonymous options as well. In summary, you want to use: \documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}  . Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers must use the author-year format for citations. It is a single-column page layout. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review. Papers must be submitted electronically through the FSE 2025 submission site:  
 https://fse2025.hotcrp.com   
 Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. The review process is that the initial output can be accept, reject or major revision  . When the initial output of the three reviews is major revision, authors will have an opportunity to address the reviewers’ requests during a 6-week  major revision period. Such requests may include additional experiments or new analyses of existing results; major rewriting of algorithms and explanations; clarifications, better scoping, and improved motivations. The revised submission must be accompanied by a response letter  , where the authors explain how they addressed each concern expressed by the reviewers. The same reviewers who requested major revisions will then assess whether the revised submission satisfies their requests adequately.  
 Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation (if relevant), quality of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as PC chairs may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for publication.  
 In addition to declaring the topics which are relevant for their submissions, authors will be asked to declare the research methods employed in their submissions. This will enable us to ensure reviewer expertise both for research methods and topics. For full definitions of the research methods, see the SIGSOFT Empirical Standards  .  
 Double-Anonymous Review Process   
 In order to ensure the fairness of the reviewing process, the FSE 2025 Research Papers Track will employ a double-anonymous review process, where reviewers do not know the identity of authors, and authors do not know the identity of external reviewers. The papers submitted must not reveal the authors’ identities in any way:  
 Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. 
  Authors should ensure that any citation to related work by themselves is written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work”. 
  Authors should not include URLs to author-revealing sites (tools, datasets). Authors are still encouraged to follow open science principles and submit replication packages, see more details on the open science policy below. 
  Authors should anonymize author-revealing company names but instead provide general characteristics of the organizations involved needed to understand the context of the paper. 
  Authors should ensure that paper acknowledgements do not reveal the origin of their work. 
  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to FSE 2025. 
  During review, authors | should not publicly use the submission title | . 
  The double-anonymous process used this year is “heavy”, i.e., the paper anonymity will be maintained during all reviewing and discussion periods. In case of major revision, authors must therefore maintain anonymity in their response letter and must provide no additional information that could be author-revealing.  
 To facilitate double-anonymous reviewing, we recommend the authors to postpone publishing their submitted work on arXiv or similar sites until after the notification  . If the authors have uploaded to arXiv or similar, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to FSE 2025.  
 Authors with further questions on double-anonymous reviewing are encouraged to contact the program chairs by email. Papers that do not comply with the double-anonymous review process will be desk-rejected.  
 Submission Policies   
 The authors must follow the “ACM Policy on Authorship” released April 20, 2023 and its accompanying FAQ including the following points:  
 “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work.” 
  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” 
  Please read the full policy and FAQ.  
 Papers submitted for consideration to FSE should not have been already published elsewhere and should not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere during the reviewing period. Specifically, authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism  and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions  .  
 To prevent double submissions, the chairs might compare the submissions with related conferences that have overlapping review periods. The double submission restriction applies only to refereed journals and conferences, not to unrefereed forums (e.g. arXiv.org). To check for plagiarism issues, the chairs might use external plagiarism detection software.  
 All publications are subject to the ACM Author Representations policy  .  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .  
 Alleged violations to any of the above policies will be reported to ACM for further investigation and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per the ACM Publications Policies.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process if your paper is accepted. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and they have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all published authors. ACM is committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 The authors of accepted papers are invited and strongly encouraged to attend the conference to present their work. Attendance at the event is not mandatory for publication. Authors also have the option of not presenting their work at the conference, in which case they do not need to register.

 Open Science Policy   
 The research track of FSE has introduced an open science policy. Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and that empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability.  
 Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked to make a replication package available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to a private or public repository) or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. Furthermore, authors are asked to indicate whether they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. We ask authors to provide a supporting statement on the availability of a replication package (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section. Be careful that such statements continue to maintain author anonymity. For more details, see the FSE open science policy  .  
 Authors of accepted papers will be given an opportunity (and encouragement) to submit their data and tools to the separate FSE’25 artifact evaluation committee.

 FAQ  
   
 FAQ on Review Process: Major Revisions, Open Science Policy, Double-Anonymous Reviewing   
 PACMSE Proceedings   
 Q: What paper format shall we follow for FSE 2025?   
 A: Papers accepted by the technical track of FSE 2025 will be published in the inaugural journal issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE). Approval has been granted by ACM in late July. Please check the Research Paper How to Submit  section for details.  
 Q: How would the inaugural PACMSE journal affect FSE 2025?   
 A: FSE will be published in the inaugural PACMSE journal following the recent practices of other communities such as PACMPL (PLDI, POPL, OOPSLA, etc.), PACMHCI, PACMMOD, PACMNET, etc.  
 Identity:  FSE papers will be published in a dedicated issue of PACMSE, with FSE as the issue name. This means that FSE papers will keep their identity!  
 Paper format:  The paper format will follow the ACM’s requirement. This is a switch from the traditional FSE two-column format to this new PACMSE single-column format. However, the amount of content should remain more or less the same: the FSE 2025’s 18 page limit in the singe-column format maps roughly to the old single-column of 10 pages.  
 Review process:  FSE already has a major-revision cycle in 2023 and 2024, which maps neatly onto PACMSE’s requirements for two rounds of reviews, so there are no PACMSE-related changes here.  
 Conference presentations:  FSE 2025’s move to PACMSE changes how the proceedings are published. All accepted papers will still be guaranteed presentation delivery at the conference in the usual way.  
 Policy on Authorship (e.g., regarding ChatGPT)   
 Q: What is the policy on Authorship, especially considering the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT?   
 A: Submissions must follow the “ ACM Policy on Authorship  ” released April 20, 2023, which contains policy regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT. Please also check the ACM FAQ  which describes in what situations generative AI tools can be used (with or without acknowledgment).  
 Major Revision Process   
 Q: Why is FSE allowing major revisions?   
 A: SE conferences are currently forced to reject papers that include valuable material, but would need major changes to become acceptable for conference presentation, because major revisions cannot be accommodated in the current review process. By supporting only a binary outcome, conferences force reviewers to decide between rejection and acceptance even in borderline cases that would be better judged after a round of major revision. This can cause additional reviewing burden for the community (the paper is resubmitted to another venue with new reviewers) and inconsistency for the authors (the new reviewers have different opinions). We hope by allowing major revisions to both increase the acceptance rate of FSE and to help reduce these current problems with the reviewing process.  
 For Authors   
 Q: If my paper receives major revisions, what happens next?   
 A: The meta-review  will clearly and explicitly list all major changes required by the reviewers to make the paper acceptable for publication. Authors of these papers are granted 6  weeks to implement the requested changes. In addition to the revised paper, authors are asked to submit a response letter that explains how each required change was implemented. If any change was not implemented, authors can explain why. The same reviewers will then review the revised paper and make their final (binary) decision. Authors can also choose to withdraw their submission if they wish.  
 Q: Will major revision become the default decision causing initial acceptance rates to drop?   
 A: This is not the intention: reviewers are instructed to accept all papers that would have been accepted when major revision  was not an available outcome.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: When shall I recommend major revision  for a paper?   
 A: Major revision  should not become the default choice for borderline papers and should be used only if without major revisions the paper would be rejected, while a properly done major revision, which addresses the reviewers’ concerns, could make the paper acceptable for publication; if the requested changes are doable in 6 weeks and are implementable within the page limit; if the requested changes are strictly necessary for paper acceptance (i.e., not just nice-to-have features); if the requested changes require recheck (i.e., reviewers cannot trust the authors to implement them directly in the camera ready).  
 Q: When shall I recommend rejection  instead of major revision  ?   
 A: Rejection  is a more appropriate outcome than major revision if the requested additions/changes are not implementable in 6 weeks; if the contribution is very narrow or not relevant to the SE audience, and it cannot be retargeted in 6 weeks; if the methodology is flawed and cannot be fixed in 6 weeks; if results are unconvincing, the paper does not seem to improve the state of the art much, and new convincing results are unlikely to be available after 6 weeks of further experiments; if the customary benchmark used in the community was ignored and cannot be adopted and compared to in 6 weeks.  
 Q: When shall I recommend acceptance  instead of major revision  ?   
 A: We do not want major revision to become the primary pathway for acceptance. We should continue to trust the authors to make minor changes to the submissions in the camera ready version. Acceptance  is preferable if the requested additions/changes are nice to have features, not mandatory for the acceptability of the work; if minor improvements of the text are needed; if minor clarifications requested by the reviewers should be incorporated; if important but not critical references should be added and discussed; if discussion of results could be improved, but the current one is already sufficient.  
 Q: What is the difference between major revision  and shepherding  ?   
 A: Major revision  is not shepherding  . While shepherding typically focuses on important but minor changes, which can be specified in an operational way and can be checked quite easily and quickly by reviewers, major revisions require major changes (although doable in 6 weeks), which means the instructions for the authors cannot be completely operational and the check will need to go deeply into the new content delivered by the paper. Hence, while the expectation for shepherded papers is that most of them will be accepted once the requested changes are implemented, this is not necessarily the case with major revisions.  
 Q: Is there a quota of papers that can have major revision  as outcome?  A: As there is no quota for the accepted papers, there is also no quota for major revisions. However, we expect that thanks to major revisions we will be able to eventually accept 10-15% more papers, while keeping the quality bar absolutely unchanged.  
 Q: What shall I write in the meta-review of a paper with major revision outcome?   
 A: With the possibility of a major revision  outcome, meta-reviews become extremely important. The meta-review  should clearly and explicitly list all major changes required by the reviewers to make the paper acceptable for publication. The meta-review should act as a contract between reviewers and authors, such that when all required changes are properly made, the paper is accepted. In this respect, the listed changes should be extremely clear, precise, and implementable.  
 Review Process   
 For Authors   
 Q: Can I withdraw my paper?   
 A: Yes, papers can be withdrawn at any time using HotCRP.  
 Q: Is appendix or other supplemental materials allowed?   
 A: The main submission file must follow the page limit. Any supplemental materials including appendix and replication packages must be submitted separately under “Supplemental Material”. Program Committee members can review supplemental materials but are not obligated to review them.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: The authors have provided a URL to supplemental material. I would like to see the material but I worry they will snoop my IP address and learn my identity. What should I do?   
 A: Contact the Program Co-Chairs, who will download the material on your behalf and make it available to you.  
 Q: If I am assigned a paper for which I feel I am not an expert, how do I seek an outside review?   
 A: PC members should do their own reviews, not delegate them to someone else. Please contact the Program Co-Chairs, especially since additional reviewers might have a different set of conflicts of interest.  
 Open Science Policy   
 Q: What is the FSE 2025 open science policy and how can I follow it?  
 A: Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked to:  
 make their data available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to an anonymous repository) and provide instructions on how to access this data in the paper; or 
  include in the paper an explanation as to why this is not possible or desirable; and 
  indicate if they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. This information should be provided in the submitted papers in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section. For more details, see the | FSE open science policy | . | Q: How can I upload supplementary material via the HotCRP site and make it anonymous for double-anonymous review? 
  A: To conform to the double-anonymous policy, please include an anonymized URL. Code and data repositories may be exported to remove version control history, scrubbed of names in comments and metadata, and anonymously uploaded to a sharing site. Instructions are provided in the FSE open science policy  .  
 Double-Anonymous Reviewing (DAR)   
 Q: Why are you using double-anonymous reviewing?   
 A: Studies have shown that a reviewer’s attitude toward a submission may be affected, even unconsciously, by the identity of the authors.  
 Q: Do you really think DAR actually works? I suspect reviewers can often guess who the authors are anyway.   
 A: It is rare for authorship to be guessed correctly, even by expert reviewers, as detailed in this study  .  
 For Authors   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 A: Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity. You should also avoid revealing the institutional affiliation of authors.  
 Q: I would like to provide supplementary material for consideration, e.g., the code of my implementation or proofs of theorems. How do I do this?   
 A: On the submission site, there will be an option to submit supplementary material along with your main paper. You can also share supplementary material in a private or publicly shared repository (preferred). This supplementary material should also be anonymized; it may be viewed by reviewers during the review period, so it should adhere to the same double-anonymous guidelines. See instructions on the FSE open science policy  .  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?   
 A: Making your code publicly available is not incompatible with double-anonymous reviewing. You can create an anonymized version of the repository and include a new URL that points to the anonymized version of the repository, similar to how you would include supplementary materials to adhere to the Open Science policy. Authors wanting to share GitHub repositories may want to look into using https://anonymous.4open.science/  which is an open source tool that helps you to quickly double-anonymize your repository.  
 Q: I am building on my own past work on the WizWoz system. Do I need to rename this system in my paper for purposes of anonymity, so as to remove the implied connection between my authorship of past work on this system and my present submission?  A: Maybe. The core question is really whether the system is one that, once identified, automatically identifies the author(s) and/or the institution. If the system is widely available, and especially if it has a substantial body of contributors and has been out for a while, then these conditions may not hold (e.g., LLVM or HotSpot), because there would be considerable doubt about authorship. By contrast, a paper on a modification to a proprietary system (e.g., Visual C++, or a research project that has not open-sourced its code) implicitly reveals the identity of the authors or their institution. If naming your system essentially reveals your identity (or institution), then anonymize it. In your submission, point out that the system name has been anonymized. If you have any doubts, please contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: I am submitting a paper that extends my own work that previously appeared at a workshop. Should I anonymize any reference to that prior work?   
 A: No. But we recommend you do not use the same title for your FSE submission, so that it is clearly distinguished from the prior paper. In general, there is rarely a good reason to anonymize a citation. When in doubt, contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my (non-anonymized) paper on my web page or arXiv?   
 A: You can discuss and present your work that is under submission at small meetings (e.g., job talks, visits to research labs, a Dagstuhl or Shonan meeting), but you should avoid broadly advertising it in a way that reaches the reviewers even if they are not searching for it. Whenever possible, please avoid posting your manuscript on public archives (e.g, ArXiV) before or during the submission period. Would you still prefer to do so, carefully avoid adding to the manuscript any reference to FSE 2025 (e.g., using footnotes saying “Submitted to FSE 2025”).  
 Q: Can I give a talk about my work while it is under review? How do I handle social media?   
 A: We have developed guidelines, described here, to help everyone navigate in the same way the tension between the normal communication of scientific results, which double-anonymous reviewing should not impede, and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of the authors for a submission. Roughly speaking, you may (of course!) discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs; we cannot describe every possible scenario.  
 Things you may do:  
 Put your submission on your home page. 
  Discuss your work with anyone who is not on the review committees, or with people on the committees with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. 
  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on arXiv or a similar site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-anonymous reviewing, etc. 
  Things you should not do:  
 Contact members of the review committees about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. 
  Publicize your work on major mailing lists used by the community (because potential reviewers likely read these lists). 
  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, FSE paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. 
  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Program Co-Chairs.  
 Q: Will the fact that FSE is double-anonymous have an impact on handling conflicts of interest?   
 A: Double-anonymous reviewing does not change the principle that reviewers should not review papers with which they have a conflict of interest, even if they do not immediately know who the authors are. Authors declare conflicts of interest when submitting their papers using the guidelines in the Call for Papers. Papers will not be assigned to reviewers who have a conflict. Note that you should not declare gratuitous conflicts of interest and the chairs will compare the conflicts declared by the authors with those declared by the reviewers. Papers abusing the system will be desk-rejected.  
 For Reviewers   
 Q: What should I do if I learn the authors’ identity? What should I do if a prospective FSE author contacts me and asks to visit my institution?  A: If you feel that the authors’ actions are largely aimed at ensuring that potential reviewers know their identity, contact the Program Co-Chairs. Otherwise, you should not treat double-anonymous reviewing differently from other reviewing. In particular, refrain from seeking out information on the authors’ identity, but if you discover it accidentally this will not automatically disqualify you as a reviewer. Use your best judgement.  
 Q: How do we handle potential conflicts of interest since I cannot see the author names?   
 A: The conference review system will ask that you identify conflicts of interest when you get an account on the submission system.  
 Q: How should I avoid learning the authors’ identity, if I am using web-search in the process of performing my review?   
 A: You should make a good-faith effort not to find the authors’ identity during the review period, but if you inadvertently do so, this does not disqualify you from reviewing the paper. As part of the good-faith effort, please turn off Google Scholar auto-notifications. Please do not use search engines with terms like the paper’s title or the name of a new system being discussed. If you need to search for related work you believe exists, do so after completing a preliminary review of the paper.  
 The above guidelines are partly based on the PLDI FAQ on double-anonymous reviewing and the ICSE 2023 guidelines on double-anonymous submissions.

 Call for SIRIP 2023 (Industry Track) 

 The annual SIGIR conference is the major international forum for the presentation of new research results and the demonstration of new systems and techniques in the broad field of information retrieval (IR). The 46th ACM SIGIR conference, will be run as a hybrid conference – in person in Taiwan, with support for remote participation, from July 23rd to 27th, 2023.  
 The SIGIR Symposium on IR in Practice (SIRIP) 2023 will be held as part of ACM SIGIR 2023, onsite (in Taipei, Taiwan) and online. We aim to provide an opportunity for researchers, engineers, practitioners, analysts and consumers to meet and discuss the latest and greatest Information Retrieval (IR) technologies as deployed in companies, big and small, and to be the premier forum for knowledge sharing across the boundary between academia and industry.

 Open problems and challenges in industry 
  Novel applications of IR/Recsys/NLP/Multimodal learning systems, and complex user interaction modeling in real-world situations 
  Innovative approaches used in deployed systems and products. We also encourage presentations from small companies, especially startups or spin-offs from either a university project or a large company. Papers discussing domain specific challenges are also welcome. 
  Position papers on the current and future state of IR in practice, and the role IR could play in shaping the next generation of information access systems. 
  Building IR systems with an emphasis on trust and safety: Combating misinformation spread; Building privacy preserving retrieval systems; Algorithmic responsibility & fairness. 
  Role of search & IR in remote & virtual settings 
  Role of search & IR in the creator economy (e.g. short video platforms, audio platforms) & marketplaces (e.g. delivery services, hospitality industry, crowdfunding platforms, retail platforms, rentals) 
  System design case-studies from industry practitioners, identifying best practices and design principles for learning systems, scalability aspects 
  Metrics and measurement techniques used at scale to understand performance of industrial systems. Success in achieving offline/online evaluation consistency 
  Presentations creating a connection with academia to solve interesting problems, including presentations from academics spending time in industry, or vice-versa, covering insights for other practitioners 
  Industrial research success stories: from research to production 

 Submission  

 Presentation proposals should be 2-4 pages (excluding references) and follow the ACM format. Formatting guidelines are available at this ACM publication site  (use the ˮsigconf” proceedings template). Please include:

 Abstract  
 Software debugging is a time-consuming endeavor involving a series of steps, such as fault localization and patch generation, each requiring thorough analysis and a deep understanding of the underlying logic. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate promising potential in coding tasks, their performance in debugging remains limited. Current LLM-based methods often focus on isolated steps and struggle with complex bugs. In this paper, we propose the first end-to-end framework, FixAgent  , for unified debugging through multi-agent synergy. It mimics the entire cognitive processes of developers, with each agent specialized as a particular component of this process rather than mirroring the actions of an independent expert as in previous multi-agent systems. Agents are coordinated through a three-level design, following a cognitive model of debugging, allowing adaptive handling of bugs with varying complexities. Experiments on extensive benchmarks demonstrate that FixAgent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art repair methods, fixing 1.25 ×    \times  ×    to 2.56 ×    \times  ×    bugs on the repo-level benchmark, Defects4J. This performance is achieved without requiring ground-truth root-cause code statements, unlike the baselines.

 1  Introduction  
 Debugging is a crucial process of identifying, analyzing, and rectifying bugs or issues in software. Significant advancements (Yang et al., 2024  ; Xia and Zhang, 2022  ; Wei et al., 2023  ; Xia and Zhang, 2024  )  have been achieved in addressing bugs with the boost of LLMs—they typically propose a prompting framework and query an LLM to automate an isolated phase in debugging, generally Fault Localization (FL) or Automated Program Repair (APR). FL attempts to identify suspicious code statements, while APR provides patches or fixed code snippets. A typical “diff” patch records the textual differences between two source code files, as shown in Figure 1   . The goal of debugging is to apply such a patch to fix the bug accurately.  
   
  Figure 1:  An example of the “diff” patch, where “@@ -142,5 +142 5 @@” indicates line 142 is modified.    Figure 2:  Overview of FixAgent. It starts with the simple L1  repair. If no plausible patch is generated, the L2  repair is triggered, and so is L3  . Agents on the same level can communicate with others.   While LLMs demonstrate great potential in addressing individual debugging tasks for basic bugs, previous studies cannot offer a satisfying solution for the entire debugging task. To bridge this gap, we propose the first multi-agent framework, FixAgent  , for end-to-end unified debugging. A key challenge lies in how to coordinate multiple agents. Previous studies that employ LLM-based multi-agent frameworks for complex problem-solving typically regard each agent as an expert and imitate the collaborative practice in humans (Hong et al., 2024  ; Islam et al., 2024  ; Qian et al., 2024  )  . However, such a paradigm has limitations in debugging. It overly emphasizes mimicking human collaboration, thus not suitable for the logical, stepwise nature of debugging. Furthermore, it faces challenges in the fine-grained allocation and optimization of resources regarding problem difficulties. The communication links among agents are mesh-like and extensive, leading to unnecessary high communication redundancy.  
   
 In response, we uniquely structure FixAgent as a hierarchical multi-agent coordination paradigm, as shown in Figure 2   . Our key insight is that an agent should act as a specific component of the cognitive process of debugging rather than mirroring the actions of an independent expert in teamwork.  In teamwork, members bring diverse perspectives and backgrounds. They engage in bidirectional discussion and negotiation to share knowledge and solve tasks collaboratively. In contrast, the cognitive process is unidirectional and coherent, with each stage building on the last. It accumulates knowledge and employs tools toward a common objective, primarily relying on self-reflection to guide thought. Since the latter aligns seamlessly with debugging, we ground the multi-agent coordination in Hale and Haworth’s cognitive debugging model (Hale and Haworth, 1991  )  . It argues that developers employ a multi-level goal-orientated mechanism during debugging based on structural learning theory (Hale et al., 1999  )  . The initial level only provides quick and straightforward solutions, and if that fails, higher levels of repairs are triggered for complex bugs, entailing more cognitive activities that involve deeper analysis, tool invocation, and external information ingestion.  
   
 Our framework encompasses seven agents, each specialized in a distinct cognitive state: 1) Helper  : retrieves and synthesizes debugging solutions through online research; 2) RepoFocus  : analyzes dependencies and identifies bug-related code files; 3) Summarizer  : generates code summaries; 4) Slicer  : isolates a code segment (typically tens to hundreds of lines) likely to cause an error; 5) Locator  : marks the specific root-cause code lines; 6) Fixer  : generates patches or fixed code snippets; 7) FixerPro  : generates an optimized patch upon the testing results of the patch generated by Fixer  along with a detailed analysis report.  
   
 Particularly, FixAgent first isolates the code file most likely causing the error through unit testing. On level one ( L1  ), only Locator  and Fixer  are initiated for simple bugs. If the generated patch is not plausible (i.e., pass all test cases), Summarizer  and Slicer  are triggered with the bug-located code file on level two ( L2  ). Then Locator  , Fixer  , and FixerPro  are called sequentially with access to the responses from Summarizer  and Slicer  . If it still fails, FixAgent undertakes a deeper inspection and thus activates all agents (i.e., level three, L3  ), where Helper  searches for solutions online to guide all the other agents, and RepoFocus  examines the entire program to provide a list of bug-related code files, followed by the other agents working in line. Slicer  , Locator  , and Fixer  can invoke traditional code analysis tools on the last two levels to collect static and dynamic analysis information.  
   
 We evaluate FixAgent on four benchmarks with bug-fix pairs across three programming languages, including real-world software (Defects4J Just et al., 2014   ) and competition programs (QuixBugs Lin et al., 2017   , Codeflaws Tan et al., 2017   , ConDefects Wu et al., 2024   ). On Defects4J, FixAgent achieves a new state-of-the-art (SoTA) by correctly fixing 197 bugs with 286 plausible fixes. Our method does not require prior FL while still outperforming strong baselines like ChatRepair, which uses ground-truth root causes with 10x sampling times. Plus, FixAgent fixes all bugs in QuixBugs and generates 2.2 ×    \times  ×    more plausible fixes on Codeflaws. Our ablation study shows that FixAgent consistently makes significant improvements across various LLM backbones.  

 2  Related Work  
 Software Debugging:  FL and APR are the two core steps in software debugging Benton et al. ( 2020  )  . Many studies aim to automate either step. Traditional FL are typically spectrum-based (Abreu et al., 2009  , 2006  ; Zhang et al., 2011  )  or mutation-based (Moon et al., 2014  ; Li and Zhang, 2017  ; Zhang et al., 2013  )  . Learning-based FL learns program behaviors from rich data sources (Li et al., 2021  , 2022  ; Lou et al., 2021  ; Li et al., 2019  )  via multiple types of neural networks. Recently, LLMAO (Yang et al., 2024  )  proposes to utilize LLMs for test-free FL. APR research either searches for suitable solutions from possible patches (Goues et al., 2012  ; Weimer et al., 2009a  , b  )  or directly generates patches by representing the generation as an explicit specification inference (Mechtaev et al., 2016  ; Nguyen et al., 2013  ; Liu et al., 2019  )  . Learning-based studies ( (Lutellier et al., 2020  ; Jiang et al., 2021  ; Ye et al., 2022  )  ) translate faulty code to correct code using neural machine translation (NMT). On top of directly prompting LLMs (Xia et al., 2023  )  , recent studies have explored prompt engineering (Xia and Zhang, 2024  , 2022  )  or combining code synthesis (Wei et al., 2023  )  to improve LLM for APR.  
   
 Large Language Models:  Various LLMs have been developed for code synthesis (Chen et al., 2021  ; Guo et al., 2024  ; Rozière et al., 2023  )  , in addition to general-purpose LLMs (OpenAI, 2023a  , b  ; Anil et al., 2023  )  . They have shown potential in solving coding-related tasks, including program repair, as investigated in empirical studies (Xia et al., 2023  ; Huang et al., 2023  ; Tian et al., 2024  )  .  
   
 LLM-based Multi-Agent (LLM-MA):  The inspiring capabilities of the single LLM-based agent boost the development of multi-agent frameworks. Recent research has demonstrated promising results in utilizing LLM-MA for complex problem-solving, including software engineering, science, and other society-simulating activities. For software engineering, LLM-MA studies (Qian et al., 2024  ; Hong et al., 2024  ; Dong et al., 2023  ; Huang et al., 2024  ; Islam et al., 2024  )  usually emulate real-world roles (e.g., product managers, programmers, and testers) and collaborate through communication. Hong et al. ( 2024  ); Dong et al. ( 2023  )  adopt a shared information pool to reduce overhead.  

 3  FixAgent  
 FixAgent is an end-to-end framework for unified debugging through LLM-based multi-agent synergy. It comprises seven agents, each specialized as a state in Hale and Haworth’s cognitive debugging model with an explicit goal instead of being a task-oriented, individual entity. FixAgent operates on a three-level architecture, initializing different levels of repair involving different agents, and agents can adaptively invoke tools in a given toolbox. The communication among agents on the same level follows an assembly-line thought process rather than the mesh interactions typical of teams. This section introduces the profiles of agents, their interactions with external environments, and the hierarchical organization. Prompt details are displayed in A.3   .  
   
 3.1  Profiles of Agents  
 All agents in FixAgent share a one-shot structure of the system prompt, which defines their roles, skills, actions, objectives, and constraints, followed by a manually crafted example to illustrate the desired response format, as shown in Figure 3   . Moreover, all agents have access to certain meta-information known as bug metadata  , including the bug-located code file, failing test cases, reported errors during compilation and testing, and program requirements described in natural language. The response of each agent comprises two elements: the answer fulfilling its goal and an explanation of its thinking. Inspired by a software engineering principle, rubber duck debugging (Andrew and David, 2000  )  , where developers articulate their expectations versus actual implementations to identify the gap, we request each agent to monitor key program variables and explain how it guides the answer.  
   
  Figure 3:  A one-shot system prompt defines the role, skills, actions, objective, and constraints of the agent.   Helper.  The goal of Helper  is to provide references via retrieve-augmented generation (RAG), inspired by the fact that developers commonly utilize web search engines (e.g., Google) to enhance productivity (Xia et al., 2017  )  . By analyzing the bug metadata, Helper  generates a short query and invokes an external search engine to retrieve the best-matching solutions. Then, it integrates the retrieval results and generates reference solutions that are customized for the context of the buggy code (e.g., variable naming and function structure). These are internal processes hidden from the other agents, and only the final response—a reference solution—can be read only on L3  . Figure 4   provides an example of the response from Helper  .  
   
  Figure 4:  After retrieving similar solutions, Helper  eventually responds with an executable debug guide.   RepoFocus.  Comprehending cross-file dependencies is crucial to debugging large software, and real-world software is often large and complex (corresponding to L3  repair). However, inputting all of the code in a program may overwhelm an LLM, resulting in slow responses with significant resource consumption or incorrect results. Thus, RepoFocus  provides a list of bug-related code files that need further examination by analyzing the bug metadata and the file structure of the program.  
   
 Summarizer.  Code summarization aims to generate concise, semantically meaningful summaries that accurately describe software functions. Unlike high-level code analysis, these natural language summaries better align with the training objectives of LLMs. Summarizer  is triggered on L2  and L3  . On L2  , it summarizes the buggy code file. Though the window size of advanced LLMs can handle most single code files, a too-long prompt may exacerbate the illusion of LLMs. Thus, Summarizer  handles overly long code here, in conjunction with Slicer  , which narrows down a suspicious segment from the buggy code. On L3  , Summarizer  runs once on every bug-related file identified by RepoFocus  . The other agents do not need to read every code line in the program while still knowing the core contents through these summaries.  
   
 Slicer.  Slicer  narrows down the inspection scope by slicing out a small suspicious segment (typically tens of code lines) from the bug-located code file. We extract the beginning and end lines from the initial output to locate the segment, ensuring the final output is directly sliced from the original code to prevent code tampering caused by LLM hallucinations. Slicer  is also launched for large software on the last two levels, where it can invoke static or dynamic analysis tools.  
   
 Locator.  Locator  is responsible for marking code lines with a comment “// buggy line” or “// missing line” to indicate faulty or missing statements. Similar to Slicer  , we directly annotate the original code through contextual string matching. Locator  only leverages the bug metadata on L1  , where on L2  , it can access the dynamic analysis reports. If the program is large enough so that Slicer  and Summarizer  are invoked, Locator  receives the suspicious code segment (generated by Slicer  ) to replace the original complete code, along with the buggy code summary (generated by Summarizer  ).  
   
 Fixer.  Fixer  is prompted to generate a ‘diff‘, as shown in Figure 1   in Introduction. It receives code marked by Locator  and other bug metadata. To maintain consistency between Locator  and Fixer  , Fixer  first assesses whether the marked lines should be modified and then describes the modification. This also enables Fixer  to correct possible errors made by Locator  . On L2  and L3  , Fixer  also has access to static/dynamic analysis and auxiliary information generated by upstream agents.  
   
  Figure 5:  L3  triggers all the seven agents to generate plausible patches.   FixerPro.  FixerPro  extends and complements Fixer  by generating an optimized patch and repair analysis. Inspired by code review, in which one or more developers check a program to ensure software quality, we request FixerPro  to evaluate the performance and potential vulnerability of the plausible fix generated by Fixer  . Then, FixerPro  provides suggestions for refactoring the patch to optimize simplicity and maintainability. If Fixer  fails, FixerPro  generates a new patch while analyzing the failing reasons.  

 3.2  External Interactions  
 Plausibility Feedback.  We conduct repairs by modifying the buggy code rather than directly applying the generated patches because they usually make mistakes in indices of code lines, as LLMs often struggle with counting, and the patch may be generated based on a sliced segment rather than the original code, causing changes in the indices of code lines. Our modification is rule-based by matching the invariant context between the patch and the buggy code. Afterward, we compile and run tests on the fixed program. The patch will be sent to developers for manual correctness  verification if passing all test cases. The results of plausibility testing are returned to FixAgent as feedback for further processing, such as initializing a higher level of repair or conducting self-reflection.  
   
 Tool Usage.  The toolbox of FixAgent currently contains static analysis tools, dynamic analysis tools, and a search engine optimized for LLMs and RAG. Static analysis provides static errors and warnings, as well as Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), a tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of source code. We mainly consider the coverage of failing test cases in dynamic analysis since it is commonly assumed that code statements not executed during testing are less likely to cause the failures Kochhar et al. ( 2016  )  . Note that the results of tool invocations will be stored for the requests of downstream agents to avoid duplicated invocations.  

 3.3  Hierarchical Coordination  
 Our main principle of coordination is that problems of different complexities warrant cognitive activities of different intensities. That is, upon the failure of a straightforward solution, a higher-level goal will be triggered with more information and thinking. Following Hale and Haworth’s cognitive debugging model, we define three workflows for the three levels of repair, respectively.  
   
 The first level identifies and fixes obvious logic errors in code, so we assume that agents can easily fix the bug. Thus, L1  only contains Locator  and Fixer  with a simple communication flow, where Fixer  generates a patch based on the fault localization done by Locator  . If the fix is not plausible, then L2  is triggered, assuming that the fix can be achieved by only inspecting a single file, which is often applied in previous FL and APR studies (Soremekun et al., 2023  )  . L2  involves five agents: Slicer  , Summarizer  , Locator  , Fixer  , and FixerPro  . Slicer  isolates a suspicious segment, and Summarizer  generates a code summary simultaneously, both from the bug-located file. Afterward, Locator  , Fixer  , and FixerPro  work in sequence based on the suspicious segment, and all have access to the code summary. If it still fails, we turn to L3  , which believes that the bug is very complex, so repairing it requires understanding cross-file dependencies and external information. L3  activates all the seven agents. First, Helper  and RepoFocus  are initialized at the same time, and Helper  provides references for all other agents. Then, Summarizer  runs multiple times following the file list identified by RepoFocus  . These code summaries are shared by the remaining four agents, which work one after another subsequently with the same workflow as L2  . Figure 5   presents an example conversation among agents on L3  .  
   
 Upon no plausible patch, FixAgent gradually requests agents on L3  to reflect and refine its answer based on the plausibility feedback in a reversed order, as downstream agents are more error-prone as errors may accumulate during the debugging process. Specifically, we first ask FixerPro  to refine its response. If the fix fails again, we then request Fixer  , leading to input changes of FixerPro  , so it is re-sampled the second time. Eventually, plausible patches are returned to developers for manual verification. If no plausible patch is produced, FixAgent will display the analysis report written by FixerPro  and take another run until reaching a resource threshold.

 4  Experiments  
 4.1  Experimental Setup  
 Benchmarks.  We evaluate FixAgent on four benchmarks featuring bug-fix pairs, including competition programs (Codeflaws Tan et al., 2017   , QuixBugs Lin et al., 2017   , ConDefects Wu et al., 2024   ) and real-world projects (Defects4J Just et al., 2014   ). Codeflaws contains 3902 faulty C programs. QuixBugs includes 40 faulty programs available in both Java and Python. ConDefects recently collected to address data leakage concerns in LLMs, consists of 1,254 Java and 1,625 Python faulty programs. Defects4J, a widely used benchmark from 15 real-world Java projects, features bugs across two versions: version 1.2 with 391 active bugs and version 2.0 adding an additional 415 active bugs, totaling 806. We will report the total number of fixes across these versions.  
   
 Baselines.  We compare FixAgent against 14 APR baselines, including:  
 • | Traditional: Angelix (Mechtaev et al., 2016  )  , Prophet (Long, 2018  )  , SPR (Long and Rinard, 2015  )  , and CVC4 (Reynolds et al., 2015  )  . 
  • | Genetic programming-based: Semfix (Nguyen et al., 2013  )  and GenProg (Goues et al., 2012  ; Weimer et al., 2009a  )  . 
  • | NMT-based: CoCoNuT (Lutellier et al., 2020  )  , CURE (Jiang et al., 2021  )  , and RewardRepair (Ye et al., 2022  )  . 
  • | Domain knowledge-driven: Tbar (Liu et al., 2019  )  and Recoder (Zhu et al., 2021  )  . 
  • | LLM-based (SoTA): AlphaRepair (Xia and Zhang, 2022  )  , Repilot (Wei et al., 2023  )  , and ChatRepair (Xia and Zhang, 2024  )  . 
    
 Note that different APR baselines adopted diverse prior fault locations. We use realistic  to represent traditional FL and perfect  to denote ground-truth FL. We report the results provided in their original papers and follow-up survey Le et al. ( 2018  ); Ye et al. ( 2021  ); Xia et al. ( 2023  )  , following previous studies Xia et al. ( 2023  ); Xia and Zhang ( 2024  ); Lutellier et al. ( 2020  )  .  
   
 LLM Backbones.  We apply FixAgent to seven LLMs, including four general-purpose models (gemini-1.5-flash Anil et al., 2023   , gpt-3.5-turbo-ca OpenAI, 2023a   , gpt-4o OpenAI, 2023b   , and claude-3.5-sonnet Anthropic, 2024   ) and three open-source code LLMs (DeepSeekCoder Guo et al., 2024   , CodeLlama-34b Rozière et al., 2023   , LLaMA2-70b Touvron et al., 2023   ). Naturally, these LLMs also serve as baselines for comparison, where we apply the original chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting method Wei et al. ( 2022  )  . The default backbone of FixAgent is gpt-4o.  
   
 Metrics.  We utilize the APR metrics, specifically focusing on the number of bugs that are plausibly or correctly fixed. Given the extensive size of ConDefects, we randomize samples from plausible fixes to verify their correctness. Thus, we also employ the metric known as correctness rate  —defined as the ratio of correct fixes to plausibly fixed bugs—to assess the effectiveness of FixAgent.  
   
 Implementation.  For single-file competition programs, only Locator  , Fixer  , and FixerPro  on L2  and L1  need to be initialized, named as FixAgent-Lite  . The maximum number of attempts is set to 5 per bug for Lite and 20 for the full version. Previous studies, however, typically sample hundreds to thousands of times. For instance, CoCoNuT samples up to 50,000 patches per bug Lutellier et al. ( 2020  )  , while ChatRepair samples 100-200 times Xia and Zhang ( 2024  )  . Our approach is significantly more cost-effective than baselines. Furthermore, we alter the default web search engine (Tavily Tavily,   ) to a local one during evaluation to prevent retrieving ground-truth solutions online. The local database consists of the training dataset of CoCoNut (Lutellier et al., 2020  )  with JavaScript programs removed. Since CoCoNuT was also evaluated on Defects4J and ConDefects, the risk of data leakage is minimal. The static and dynamic analysis is supported by our written scripts and open-source plugins ( SonarQube,   and GZoltar,   ).  

 4.2  Comparison with baselines  
 This section evaluates the debugging capabilities of our framework, FixAgent. The results are shown in Table 1   . We do not use ConDefects herein because it is a recently released dataset, and few approaches have been evaluated on it.  
   
 Competition Programs.  FixAgent plausibly fixes 3130 out of 3982 bugs on Codeflaws, producing 2.2x plausible fixes as the best APR method, GenProg. It has a correctness rate of 95%, i.e., FixAgent correctly repairs 95 bugs out of 100 sampled plausible patches, improving the correctness rate by 60.81% compared to that of CoCoNuT, which correctly fixes the most bugs among APR approaches. FixAgent surpasses the best-performing LLM baseline, claude-3.5-sonnet, by ∼  similar-to   \sim  ∼    19.28% with the same correctness rate. Moreover, FixAgent successfully fixes all bugs in QuixBugs across two programming languages, achieving the same SoTA as ChatRepair.  
   
 Real-World Software.  On Defects4J, FixAgent correctly fixes 197 bugs while plausibly solving 286 bugs, outperforming the SoTA, ChatRepair, by ∼  similar-to   \sim  ∼    25.48%. Moreover, FixAgent correctly fixes 42 unique bugs that the top four baselines have never fixed. Figure 6   shows the Venn diagram of the bugs fixed by the top four baselines and FixAgent on Defects4J. We see that FixAgent correctly fixes 42 unique bugs that these strong baselines have not addressed. We show an example of the unique fixes in A.1   .  
   
  Figure 6:  Bug fix Venn diagram on Defects4J.   Overall, LLM-involved baselines perform reasonably well. On top, FixAgent significantly enhances base LLMs on all benchmarks, especially on Defects4J. This is because direct prompting LLMs struggles with too long contexts and complex reasoning. We split debugging into several cognitive steps and introduce external tools and knowledge, thus boosting the capabilities of LLMs.  
   
     Takeaway:  FixAgent fixes 197 bugs on Defects4J, a 25.48% improvement over the leading baseline. Its lite version fixes all bugs on QuixBugs and achieves 19.28% more plausible fixes on ConDefects with the highest correctness rate.

 4.3  Performance on Different LLMs  
 To verify the robustness of FixAgent across various LLMs, we compare FixAgent-Lite with its seven LLM backbones, evaluated on 600 randomly sampled bugs from ConDefects (300 for each programming language). Since manually checking the patches is time-consuming, we only present the number of plausible fixes. Table 3   displays the performance gains of FixAgent-Lite (UD-L) over its backbone with CoT prompting. For simplicity, we only report the number of plausible fixes.  
   
 Table 3:  Performance gains of FixAgent-Lite over different LLMs on 600 samples from ConDefects.  LLMs   ConDefects-Java   ConDefects-Python    CoT  UD-L  Gain ↑  ↑   \uparrow  ↑     CoT  UD-L  Gain ↑  ↑   \uparrow  ↑      CodeLlama-34b  87  113  29.89%  69  86  24.64%   LLaMA2-70b  108  147  36.11%  91  133  46.15%    DeepSeekCoder  130  198  52.31%   125  178  42.40%   gemini-1.5-flash  62  89  43.55%  63  82  30.16%   gpt-3.5-turbo-ca  155  191  23.23%  127  174  37.01%   claude-3.5-sonnet  213  259  21.60%  186  227  22.04%   gpt-4o  211  262  24.17%  179  225  25.70%          
  The results indicate that FixAgent can consistently enhance its backbone LLM by 21.60%-52.31%. Notably, UD-L with LLaMA2 achieves 280 plausible fixes, closely rivaling the performance of gpt-3.5-turbo-ca (282). Plus, UD-L with DeepSeekCoder plausibly fixes similar bugs (376) as gpt-4o does (390). The results indicate that FixAgent brings the gap between open-source code LLMs and proprietary systems like gpt-4o in debugging. Furthermore, though FixAgent can make improvements across varying LLMs, its overall performance is strongly related to the coding ability of its backbone LLM.  

 4.4  Ablation Study  
 4.4.1  Impact of Different Agents  
 To understand the impact of different agents on the effectiveness of FixAgent, we exclude certain agents across Defects4J, as we trigger all agents on it. We also report the number of plausible fixes herein. As indicated by Table 2   , the addition of agents different from just Fixer  consistently improves the number of plausible fixes. While more agents slightly increase the expenses, the overall performance improves noticeably, demonstrating the effectiveness of the various agents and the importance of the divide-and-conquer idea. Since the higher level is only triggered when the lower level fails, higher levels naturally improve performance.  
   
 Plus, the performance gains of L2  to L1  are more pronounced than that of L3  to L2  as expected, since L2  adds more agents to L1  with tool usage, while L3  only adds reference solutions and auxiliary cross-file information. We notice that Helper  only increases 46 plausible fixes, indicating that the internet cannot always provide solutions, so domain-specific tools for debugging are highly desired.  

 4.4.2  Impact of External Interactions  
 We also evaluate the impact of external interactions on Defects4J, including the feedback of testing results to FixerPro  and toolbox usage. As shown in Table 4   , introducing external interactions leads to a significant improvement ranging from 23 to 121 in the number of plausible fixes. This illustrates how our designed mechanism of environment interactions can contribute to high-quality debugging.

 5  Conclusion  
 This paper presents FixAgent, the first end-to-end framework leveraging LLM-based multi-agent synergy to tackle unified software debugging. Our method employs a novel hierarchical coordination paradigm, inspired by a cognitive debugging model, to efficiently manage cognitive steps with minimal communication and dynamically adjust to bug complexity through its three-level architecture. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over SoTA repair approaches and base LLMs. FixAgent fixes 1.25–2.56 ×    \times  ×    bugs on a repo-level benchmark and fixes all bugs on QuixBugs. Its lite version achieves the most plausible fixes on the other two competition program benchmarks. Lastly, the effective implementation of Hale and Haworth’s cognitive model for debugging paves new pathways for research in advancing LLM-based multi-agent frameworks for tackling complex coding tasks.  

 6  Limitation  
 While our study introduces the end-to-end framework FixAgent with a hierarchical multi-agent approach for debugging, it does come with certain limitations. First, the complexity of coordinating multiple agents increases computation overhead and can slow down the debugging process, particularly in resource-constrained environments. Second, our framework relies heavily on predefined agent roles and assumptions, which may not fully generalize to novel or edge-case bugs in diverse programming languages. Third, the integration of external program analysis tools, while useful, can introduce delays and inconsistencies in data retrieval, affecting the overall efficiency. Future work should explore optimizing token consumption, improving adaptability to diverse bug types, and ensuring smoother integration with external tools for faster and more reliable debugging.  

 7  Ethics Consideration  
 We do not foresee any immediate ethical or societal risks arising from our work. However, given that FixAgent relies heavily on LLM-generated code patches, there is a potential risk of introducing unintended vulnerabilities or errors in software. We encourage researchers and practitioners to apply FixAgent cautiously, particularly when using it in production environments. Ensuring thorough validation and testing of LLM-generated patches is crucial to mitigate any negative consequences. Additionally, We adhere to the License Agreement of the LLM models and mentioned open-sourced tools.

 Appendix A  Appendix  
 A.1  Unique Fix Example  
 We illustrate the power of FixAgent by showing an example bug that is only fixed by FixAgent in Figure 7   .  
   
  Figure 7:  Unique bug fixed by FixAgent in Defects4J.   On the one hand, the fix requires filling in the missing code statements. Traditional FL based on failing test coverage cannot directly identify such an error of lacking the necessary processing of a branching condition. Plus, many template-based or NMT-based APR tools are good at repairing common errors such as syntax errors or simple logic errors, but not at generating new business logic. On the other hand, this fix requires a deep understanding of the specific Jackson deserialization features defined in the package “databind.DeserializationFeature”. Previous LLM-based APR often relies on local context in the prompt and statistical correlation so as to lack the ability to comprehend other code files within the project repo. The three levels of repair enable FixAgent to access extra related information (including templates and repo-level documents) and testing feedback, as well as enhance its reasoning ability under the idea of divide-and-conquer. Combining all these conditions together, FixAgent is able to correctly fix this complex bug.

 A.3  System Prompts  
 This section shows the specific system prompts of the designed seven agents.  
   
  Figure 8:  System Prompt of Helper  .    Figure 9:  System Prompt of RepoFocus  .    Figure 10:  System Prompt of Summarizer  .    Figure 11:  System Prompt of Slicer  .    Figure 12:  System Prompt of Locator  .    Figure 13:  System Prompt of Fixer  .    Figure 14:  System Prompt of FixerPro  .    
 A.4  A Demo of the Execution  
 In this section, we present an example of how FixAgent solves a real-world bug on level-3 repair.  
   
 A.4.1  Bug Metadata  
 Upon receiving the necessary information about a bug, FixAgent initializes agents for problem-solving. Here is an example bug named Lang-1, a real-world bug in Defects4J.  
   
 Using the JUnit framework, we can get detailed information upon failing test cases, as displayed in Figure 15   .  
   
  Figure 15:  Failing test cases reported by JUnit.   Then, we can roughly locate the buggy code file “NumberUtils.java”, whose code contents are show in Figure 16   , as well as the failing oracles in testing code 17   .  
   
  Figure 16:  Bug-located code snippet.    Figure 17:  Testing code triggering errors.   From the above information, we can see that the original code merely determines whether a value exceeds the ranges of Long and int based on the length of hexadecimal numbers. However, when the length of a hexadecimal number is 16, and the first significant digit is greater than 7, it actually goes beyond the range of Long. The original code fails to take this situation into account, and similar issues exist in the int range.  

 A.4.2  L3 Repair  
 For simplicity, we only show the responses from agents on level three of repair. Helper  generates a short query summarizing the problem of this bug based on the testing information and buggy code, as shown in Figure 18   . All the other agents can benefit from its generated debugging guide. Afterward, RepoFocus  lists a list of bug-related files ( 19   ). Besides the bug-located file, it also identifies two other files. However, they would not influence the behavior of the number-creation logic unless you are encountering specific exception handling or Unicode string issues when parsing numeric strings. Subsequently, Summarizer  generates a code summary for each identified file 20   . Thus, we got all the information provided by upstream agents.

Slicer  extracts 168 suspicious code lines from 1427 lines in the original buggy code, largely narrowing down the examination scope, as shown in Figure 21   .

It attempts to fulfill the missing code block by counting the valid digits of the hexadecimal number but causes incorrect type determination when a large number of leading zeros are present in a hexadecimal string. The patched code also assumes the hex digits should be directly compared based on raw string length without adjusting for those leading zeros. FixerPro  identified the causes of errors made by Fixer  , and provides an optimized patch. The fixed version, presented in Figure 24   , properly calculates the significant digits by counting the non-zero characters after the prefix and leading zeros. It also adjusts the comparisons for handling 16-digit and 8-digit boundary checks, ensuring that only significant digits are considered when deciding if the value is too large for “Integer” or “Long”.

 Call for Full Papers 

 The annual SIGIR conference is the major international forum for the presentation of new research results, and the demonstration of new systems and techniques, in the broad field of information retrieval (IR). The 46th ACM SIGIR conference, will be run as a hybrid conference – in person in Taiwan, with support for remote participation, from July 23rd to 27th, 2023. We welcome contributions related to any aspect of information retrieval and access, including theories, foundations, algorithms, evaluation, analysis, and applications. The conference and program chairs invite those working in areas related to IR to submit high-impact original papers for review. Please note a CFP for other paper tracks, as well as workshops, tutorials, doctoral consortium, industry day, and other SIGIR 2023 venues will be released separately.  

 Important Dates  

 Time zone: Anywhere on Earth(AoE)    
  Full paper abstracts due: January 24, 2023  
  Full papers due: January 31, 2023  
  Full paper notifications: April 4, 2023  
  Camera ready papers: April 26, 2023  

 Publication date:  accepted papers will be published open access for one month on the ACM Digital Library up to two weeks prior to the conference opening date (exact date TBA)  
 Full paper authors are required to submit an abstract by midnight January 24, 2023 AoE. Paper submission (deadline: midnight January 31, 2023 AoE) is not possible without a submitted abstract. We recommend authors waiting for notification from the other conferences to submit an abstract, even if they do not ultimately submit a paper. Immediately after the abstract deadline, PC Chairs will desk reject submissions that lack informative titles and abstracts (“placeholder abstracts”).  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  

 Submission Guidelines  

 See this brief checklist to strengthen an IR paper   , for authors and reviewers.  
 Full research papers must describe original work that has not been previously published, not accepted for publication elsewhere, and not simultaneously submitted or currently under review in another journal or conference (including the other tracks of SIGIR 2023).  
 Submissions of full research papers must be in English, in PDF format, and be at most 9 pages (including figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any content except references) in length, with unrestricted space for references, in the current ACM two-column conference format. Suitable LaTeX, Word, and Overleaf   templates are available from the ACM Website   (use “sigconf” proceedings template for LaTeX and the Interim Template for Word). ACM’s CCS concepts and keywords are not required for review but may be required if accepted and published by the ACM.  

 For LaTeX, the following should be used:  
 documentclass[sigconf,natbib=true,anonymous=true]{acmart}  Submissions must be anonymous and should be submitted electronically via EasyChair:  
  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigir23    
  At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for, and present the work at the conference.  

 Anonymity  

 The full paper review process is double-blind. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submission must not include author information and must not include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent. However, it is acceptable to refer to companies or organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments or deployed solutions if there is no implication that the authors are currently affiliated with these organizations. While authors can upload to institutional or other preprint repositories such as arXiv.org before reviewing is complete, we generally discourage this since it places anonymity at risk. If the paper is already on arXiv, please change the title and abstract so that it is not immediately obvious they are the same. Do not upload the paper to a preprint site after submission to SIGIR—wait until a review decision to avoid reviewers seeing the paper in daily digests or other places. Breaking anonymity puts the submission at risk of being desk rejected.  
 Authors should carefully go through ACM’s authorship policy   before submitting a paper. Please ensure that all authors are clearly identified in EasyChair before the submission deadline. To support the identification of reviewers with conflicts of interest, the full author list must be specified at submission time. No changes to authorship   will be permitted for the camera-ready submission under any circumstance or after submissions close. So please, make sure you have them listed correctly when submissions close.  

 Desk Rejection Policy  

 Submissions that violate the preprint policy, anonymity, length, or formatting requirements, or are determined to violate ACM’s policies on academic dishonesty   , including plagiarism, author misrepresentation, falsification, etc., are subject to desk rejection by the chairs. Any of the following may result in desk rejection:  
 Figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgements, or any other content after page 9 of the submission. 
  Formatting not in line with the guidelines provided above. 
  Authors or authors’ institutional affiliations clearly named or easily discoverable. 
  Links to source code repositories that reveal author identities, or extended versions of the current paper. It is recommended to hold these for the final published version and | submit source code for artifact review | . 
  Addition of authors after abstract submission. 
  Content that has been determined to have been copied from other sources. 
  Any form of academic fraud or dishonesty. 
  Lack of topical fit for SIGIR.

  Christian Kästner  . Machine Learning in Production: From Models to Products  . Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, April 2025. [ http  , bib  ] A practical and innovative textbook detailing how to build real-world software products with machine learning components, not just models. Traditional machine learning texts focus on how to train and evaluate the machine learning model, while MLOps books focus on how to streamline model development and deployment. But neither focus on how to build actual products that deliver value to users. This practical textbook, by contrast, details how to responsibly build products with machine learning components, covering the entire development lifecycle from requirements and design to quality assurance and operations. Machine Learning in Production brings an engineering mindset to the challenge of building systems that are usable, reliable, scalable, and safe within the context of real-world conditions of uncertainty, incomplete information, and resource constraints. Based on the author's popular class at Carnegie Mellon, this pioneering book integrates foundational knowledge in software engineering and machine learning to provide the holistic view needed to create not only prototype models but production-ready systems. • Integrates coverage of cutting-edge research, existing tools, and real-world applications • Provides students and professionals with an engineering view for production-ready machine learning systems • Proven in the classroom • Offers supplemental resources including slides, videos, exams, and further readings  

   Yining She  , Sumon Biswas  , Christian Kästner  , and Eunsuk Kang  . FairSense: Long-Term Fairness Analysis of ML-Enabled Systems  . In Proceedings of the 47th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)  , April 2025. [ bib  ] Algorithmic fairness of machine learning (ML) models has raised significant concern in the recent years. Many testing, verification, and bias mitigation techniques have been proposed to identify and reduce fairness issues in ML models. The existing methods are model-centric and designed to detect fairness issues under static settings. However, many ML-enabled systems operate in a dynamic environment where the predictive decisions made by the system impact the environment, which in turn affects future decision-making. Such a self-reinforcing feedback loop can cause fairness violations in the long term, even if the immediate outcomes are fair. In this paper, we propose a simulation-based framework called FairSense to detect and analyze long-term unfairness in ML-enabled systems. In particular, the framework targets systems with an ML model that is trained over tabular data using supervised learning. Given a fairness requirement, FairSense performs Monte-Carlo simulation to enumerate evolution traces for each system configuration. Then, FairSense performs sensitivity analysis on the space of system parameters to understand the impact of configuration decisions on long-term fairness of the system. We demonstrate FairSense's potential utility through three real-world case studies: Loan lending, opioids risk scoring, and predictive policing.

An Empirical Study on Reproducible Packaging in Open-Source Ecosystems  . In Proceedings of the 47th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)  , April 2025. [ bib  ] The integrity of software builds is fundamental to the security of the software supply chain. While Thompson first raised the potential for attacks on build infrastructure in 1984, limited attention has been given to build integrity in the past 40 years, enabling recent attacks on SolarWinds, event-stream, and xz. The best-known defense against build system attacks is creating reproducible builds; however, achieving them can be complex for both technical and social reasons and thus is often viewed as impractical to obtain. In this paper, we analyze reproducibility of builds in a novel context: reusable components distributed as packages in six popular software ecosystems (npm, Maven, PyPI, Go, RubyGems, and Cargo). Our quantitative study on a representative sample of 4000 packages in each ecosystem raises concerns: Rates of reproducible builds vary widely between ecosystems, with some ecosystems having all packages reproducible whereas others have \issues in nearly every package. However, upon deeper investigation, we identified that with relatively straightforward infrastructure configuration and patching of build tools, we can achieve very high rates of reproducible builds in all studied ecosystems. We conclude that if the ecosystems adopt our suggestions, the build process of published packages can be independently confirmed for nearly all packages without individual developer actions, and doing so will prevent significant future software supply chain attacks.

Beyond the Comfort Zone: Emerging Solutions to Overcome Challenges in Integrating LLMs into Software Products  . Technical Report 2410.12071, arXiv, October 2024. [ http  , bib  ] Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded into software products across diverse industries, enhancing user experiences, but at the same time introducing numerous challenges for developers. Unique characteristics of LLMs force developers, who are accustomed to traditional software development and evaluation, out of their comfort zones as the LLM components shatter standard assumptions about software systems. This study explores the emerging solutions that software developers are adopting to navigate the encountered challenges. Leveraging a mixed-method research, including 26 interviews and a survey with 332 responses, the study identifies 19 emerging solutions regarding quality assurance that practitioners across several product teams at Microsoft are exploring. The findings provide valuable insights that can guide the development and evaluation of LLM-based products more broadly in the face of these challenges.

In Proceedings of the 39th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE)  , Los Alamitos, CA: IEEE Computer Society, November 2024. Acceptance rate: 26 % (155/587). [ .pdf  , bib  ] Machine learning models make mistakes, yet sometimes it is difficult to identify the systematic problems behind the mistakes. Practitioners engage in various activities, including error analysis, testing, auditing, and red-teaming, to form hypotheses of what can go (or has gone) wrong with their models. To validate these hypotheses, practitioners employ data slicing to identify examples relevant to their hypotheses. However, traditional data slicing is limited by available features and programmatic slicing functions. In this work, we propose SemSlicer, a framework that supports semantic data slicing, which identifies a semantically coherent slice, without the need for existing features. SemSlicer uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to annotate datasets and generate slices from any user-defined slicing criteria. We show that SemSlicer generates accurate slices with low cost, allows flexible trade-offs between different design dimensions, reliably identifies under-performing data slices, and helps practitioners identify useful data slices that reflect systematic problems.  

   Menon Alka  , Zahra Abba Omar  , Nadia Nahar  , Xenophon Papademetris  , Lynn Fiellin  , and Christian Kästner  . Lessons from Clinical Communications for AI Systems  . In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society (AIES)  , October 2024. [ .pdf  , bib  ] One of the major challenges in the use of opaque, complex AI models is the need or desire to provide an explanation to the end-user (and other stakeholders) as to how the system arrived at the answer it did. While there is significant research in the development of explainability techniques for AI, the question remains as to who needs an explanation, what an explanation consists of, and how to communicate this to a lay user who lacks direct expertise in the area. In this position paper, an interdisciplinary team of researchers argue that the example of clinical communications offers lessons to those interested in improving the transparency and interpretability of AI systems. We identify five lessons from clinical communications: (1) offering explanations for AI systems and disclosure of their use recognizes the dignity of those using and impacted by it; (2) AI explanations can be productively targeted rather than totally comprehensive; (3) AI explanations can be enforced through codified rules but also norms, guided by core values; (4) what constitutes a “good” AI explanation will require repeated updating due to changes in technology and social expectations; 5) AI explanations will have impacts beyond defining any one AI system, shaping and being shaped by broader perceptions of AI. We review the history, debates and consequences surrounding the institutionalization of one type of clinical communication, informed consent, in order to illustrate the challenges and opportunities that may await attempts to offer explanations of opaque AI models. We highlight takeaways and implications for computer scientists and policymakers in the context of growing concerns and moves toward AI governance.  

   Nadia Nahar  , Haoran Zhang  , Grace Lewis  , Shurui Zhou  , and Christian Kästner  . The Product Beyond the Model -- An Empirical Study of Repositories of Open-Source ML Products  . In Proceedings of the 47th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)  , April 2025. [ .pdf  , bib  ] Machine learning (ML) components are increasingly incorporated into software products for end-users, but developers face challenges in transitioning from ML prototypes to products. Academics have limited access to the source of commercial ML products, challenging research progress. In this study, first, we contribute a novel process to identify 262 open-source ML products among more than half a million ML-related projects on GitHub. Then, we qualitatively and quantitatively analyze 30 open-source ML products to answer six broad research questions about development practices and system architecture. We find that the majority of the ML products in our sample represent startup-style development reported in past interview studies. We report 21 findings, including limited involvement of data scientists in many ML products, unusually low modularity between ML and non-ML code, diverse architectural choices on incorporating models into products, and limited prevalence of industry best practices such as model testing, pipeline automation, and monitoring. Additionally, we discuss 7 implications of this study on research, development, and education, including the need for tools to assist teams without data scientists, education opportunities, and open-source-specific research for privacy-preserving telemetry.

In Proceedings of the 47th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)  , April 2025. [ .pdf  , bib  ] Many developers relying on open-source digital infrastructure expect continuous maintenance, but even the most critical packages can become unmaintained. Despite this, there is little understanding of the prevalence of abandonment of widely-used packages, of subsequent exposure, and of reactions to abandonment in practice, or the factors that influence them. We perform a large-scale quantitative analysis of all widely-used npm packages and find that abandonment is common among them, that abandonment exposes many projects which often do not respond, that responses correlate with other dependency management practices, and that removal is significantly faster when a projects end-of-life status is explicitly stated. We end with recommendations to both researchers and practitioners who are facing dependency abandonment or are sunsetting projects, such as opportunities for low-effort transparency mechanisms to help exposed projects make better, more informed decisions.

Regulating Explainability in Machine Learning Applications -- Observations from a Policy Design Experiment  . In Proceedings of the Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT)  , pages 2101--2112, June 2024. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), concerns about AI applications causing unforeseen harms to safety, privacy, security, and fairness are intensifying. While attempts to create regulations are underway, with initiatives such as the EU AI Act and the 2023 White House executive order, skepticism abounds as to the efficacy of such regulations. This paper explores an interdisciplinary approach to designing policy for the explainability of AI-based products, as the widely discussed "right to explanation" in the EU General Data Protection Regulation is ambiguous. To develop practical guidance for explainability, we conducted an experimental study that involved continuous collaboration among a team of researchers with AI and policy backgrounds over the course of ten weeks. The objective was to determine whether, through interdisciplinary effort, we can reach consensus on a policy for explainability in AI—one that is clearer, and more actionable and enforceable than current provisions. We share nine observations, derived from an iterative policy design process, which included drafting the policy, attempting to comply with it (or circumvent it), and collectively evaluating its effectiveness on a weekly basis. The observations include: iterative and continuous feedback was useful to improve policy drafts over time, discussing what evidence would satisfy policy was necessary during policy design, and human-subject studies were found to be necessary evidence to ensure effectiveness. We conclude with a note of optimism, arguing that meaningful policies can be achieved within a moderate time frame and with limited experience in policy design, as demonstrated by our student researchers on the team. This holds promising implications for policymakers, signaling that practical and effective regulation for AI applications is attainable.

In Proceedings of the Joint European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE-SRC)  , pages 2195--2197, New York, NY: ACM Press, 2023. FSE student research competition. [ doi  , bib  ] Past research suggests software should be continuously maintained in order to remain useful in our digital society. To determine whether these studies on software evolution are supported in modern-day software libraries, we conduct a natural experiment on 26,050 GitHub repositories, statistically modeling library usage based on their package-level downloads against different factors related to project maintenance.

Yet, we have little understanding of what motivates developers to join and maintain already established projects. Previous research on volunteering motivations emphasizes that individuals are motivated by a unique set of factors to volunteer in a specific area, suggesting that the motivations behind open-source contributions also depend on the nature of the work. We aim to determine correlations between types of open-source contributions and their specific motivators through surveys of open-source contributors.

In Proceedings of the International Conference on AI Engineering - Software Engineering for AI (CAIN)  , pages 166--171, April 2024. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into software applications. Downstream application developers often access LLMs through APIs provided as a service. However, LLM APIs are often updated silently and scheduled to be deprecated, forcing users to continuously adapt to evolving models. This can cause performance regression and affect prompt design choices, as evidenced by our case study on toxicity detection. Based on our case study, we emphasize the need for and re-examine the concept of regression testing for evolving LLM APIs. We argue that regression testing LLMs requires fundamental changes to traditional testing approaches, due to different correctness notions, prompting brittleness, and non-determinism in LLM APIs.

International Conference on Software Engineering -- New Ideas Track (ICSE-NIER)  , pages 57--61, April 2024. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Trust is integral for the successful and secure functioning of software supply chains, making it important to measure the state and evolution of trust in open source communities. However, existing security and supply chain research often studies the concept of trust without a clear definition and relies on obvious and easily available signals like GitHub stars without deeper grounding. In this paper, we explore how to measure trust in open source supply chains with the goal of developing robust measures for trust based on the behaviors of developers in the community. To this end, we contribute a process for decomposing trust in a complex large-scale system into key trust relationships, systematically identifying behavior-based indicators for the components of trust for a given relationship, and in turn operationalizing data-driven metrics for those indicators, allowing for the wide-scale measurement of trust in practice.

Beyond Testers’ Biases: Guiding Model Testing with Knowledge Bases using LLMs  . In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing -- Findings (EMNLP)  , pages 13504--13519, December 2023. [ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] Current model testing work has mostly focused on creating test cases. Identifying what to test is a step that is largely ignored and poorly supported. We propose Weaver, an interactive tool that supports requirements elicitation for guiding model testing. Weaver uses large language models to generate knowledge bases and recommends concepts from them interactively, allowing testers to elicit requirements for further testing. Weaver provides rich external knowledge to testers and encourages testers to systematically explore diverse concepts beyond their own biases. In a user study, we show that both NLP experts and non-experts identified more, as well as more diverse concepts worth testing when using Weaver. Collectively, they found more than 200 failing test cases for stance detection with zero-shot ChatGPT. Our case studies further show that Weaver can help practitioners test models in real-world settings, where developers define more nuanced application scenarios (e.g., code understanding and transcript summarization) using LLMs.

Technical Report 2308.04328, arXiv, August 2023. [ http  , bib  ] Machine learning (ML) components are increasingly incorporated into software products, yet developers face challenges in transitioning from ML prototypes to products. Academic researchers struggle to propose solutions to these challenges and evaluate interventions because they often do not have access to close-sourced ML products from industry. In this study, we define and identify open-source ML products, curating a dataset of 262 repositories from GitHub, to facilitate further research and education. As a start, we explore six broad research questions related to different development activities and report 21 findings from a sample of 30 ML products from the dataset. Our findings reveal a variety of development practices and architectural decisions surrounding different types and uses of ML models that offer ample opportunities for future research innovations. We also find very little evidence of industry best practices such as model testing and pipeline automation within the open-source ML products, which leaves room for further investigation to understand its potential impact on the development and eventual end-user experience for the products.

In Proceedings of the European Software Engineering Conference and ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (ESEC/FSE)  , pages 1281--1293, New York, NY: ACM Press, December 2023. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] While lots of research has explored how to prevent maintainers from abandoning the open-source projects that serve as our digital infrastructure, there are very few insights on addressing abandonment when it occurs. We argue open-source sustainability research must expand its focus beyond trying to keep particular projects alive, to also cover the sustainable use of open source by supporting users when they face potential or actual abandonment. We perform an interview study with 33 developers who have experienced open-source dependency abandonment and analyze the data using iterative thematic analysis. Often, multiple strategies were used to cope with abandonment, for example, first reaching out to the community to find potential alternatives, then switching to a community-accepted alternative if one exists. We found many developers felt they had little to no support or guidance when facing abandonment, leaving them to figure out what to do through a trial-and-error process on their own. Abandonment introduces cost for otherwise seemingly free dependencies, but users can decide whether and how to prepare for abandonment through a number of different strategies, such as dependency monitoring, building abstraction layers, and community involvement. In many cases, community members can invest in resources that help others facing the same abandoned dependency, but often do not because of the many other competing demands on their time – in a form of the volunteer's dilemma. We discuss cost reduction strategies and ideas to overcome this volunteers dilemma. Our findings can be used directly by open-source users seeking resources on dealing with dependency abandonment, or by researchers to motivate future work supporting the sustainable use of open source.

A Meta-Summary of Challenges in Building Products with ML Components – Collecting Experiences from 4758+ Practitioners  . In Proceedings of the International Conference on AI Engineering - Software Engineering for AI (CAIN)  , pages 171--183, May 2023. [ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] Incorporating machine learning (ML) components into software products raises new software-engineering challenges and elevates already existing challenges. Many researchers have invested significant effort into understanding the challenges of industry practitioners working on building products with ML components through interviews and surveys with practitioners. With the intention to aggregate and present their collective findings, we conduct a meta-summary study: We collect 50 relevant papers that together interacted with over 4758 practitioners using guidelines for systematic literature reviews and subsequently group and organize the over 500 mentions of challenges within those papers. We highlight the most commonly reported challenges and how this meta-summary will be a useful resource for the research community to prioritize research and education in this field.

Aspirations and Practice of ML Model Documentation: Moving the Needle with Nudging and Traceability  . In Proceedings of the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI)  , Article No.: 749, April 2023. [ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] The documentation practice for machine-learned (ML) models often falls short of established practices for traditional software, which impedes model accountability and inadvertently abets inappropriate or misuse of models. Recently, model cards, a proposal for model documentation, have attracted notable attention, but their impact on the actual practice is unclear. In this work, we systematically study the model documentation in the field and investigate how to encourage more responsible and accountable documentation practice. Our analysis of publicly available model cards reveals a substantial gap between the proposal and the practice. We then designed a tool named DocML aiming to (1) nudge the data scientists to comply with the model cards proposal during the model development, especially the sections related to ethics, and (2) assess and manage the documentation quality. A lab study reveals the benefit of our tool towards long-term documentation quality and accountability.

In Proceedings of the AAAI-23 Workshop on Artificial Intelligence Safety (SafeAI)  , pages 1--8, February 2023. [ .pdf  , http  , bib  ] In spite of machine learning’s rapid growth, its engineering support is scattered in many forms, and tends to favor certain engineering stages, stakeholders, and evaluation preferences. We envision a capability-based framework, which uses fine-grained specifications for ML model behaviors to unite existing efforts towards better ML engineering. We use concrete scenarios (model design, debugging, and maintenance) to articulate capabilities’ broad applications across various different dimensions, and their impact on building safer, more generalizable and more trustworthy models that reflect human needs. Through preliminary experiments, we show the potential of capabilities for reflecting model generalizability, which can provide guidance for the ML engineering process. We discuss challenges and opportunities for the integration of capabilities into ML engineering.

MLTEing Models: Negotiating, Evaluating, and Documenting Model and System Qualities  . In Proceedings of the Proc. International Conference on Software Engineering -- New Ideas Track (ICSE-NIER)  , pages 31--36, May 2023. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Many organizations seek to ensure that machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) systems work as intended in production but currently do not have a cohesive methodology in place to do so. To fill this gap, we propose MLTE (Machine Learning Test and Evaluation, colloquially referred to as “melt”), a framework and implementation to evaluate ML models and systems. The framework compiles state-of-the-art evaluation techniques into an organizational process for interdisciplinary teams, including model developers, software engineers, system owners, and other stakeholders. The MLTE tooling supports this process by providing a domain-specific language that teams can use to express model requirements an infrastructure to define, generate, and collect ML evaluation metrics, and the means to communicate results.

In Proceedings of the 37th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE)  , Article No.: 30, New York, NY: ACM Press, October 2022. Acceptance rate: 22 % (116/527). [ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] Data science pipelines to train and evaluate models with machine learning may contain bugs just like any other code. Leakage between training and test data can lead to overestimating the model's accuracy during offline evaluations, possibly leading to deployment of low-quality models in production. Such leakage can happen easily by mistake or by following poor practices but may be tedious and challenging to detect manually. We develop a static analysis approach to detect common forms of data leakage in data science code. Our evaluation shows that our analysis accurately detects data leakage and that such leakage is pervasive among over 100,000 analyzed public notebooks. We discuss how our static analysis approach can help both practitioners and educators, and how leakage prevention can be designed into the development process.

In Proceedings of the 38th International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME)  , pages 399--403, October 2022. Acceptance rate: 44 % (17/39). [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Data analysis is an exploratory, interactive, and often collaborative process. Computational notebooks have become a popular tool to support this process, among others because of their ability to interleave code, narrative text, and results. However, notebooks in practice are often criticized as hard to maintain and being of low code quality, including problems such as unused or duplicated code and out-of-order code execution. Data scientists can benefit from better tool support when maintaining and evolving notebooks. We argue that central to such tool support is identifying the structure of notebooks. We present a lightweight and accurate approach to extract notebook structure and outline several ways such structure can be used to improve maintenance tooling for notebooks, including navigation and finding alternatives.  

   Christian Kästner  , Eunsuk Kang  , and Sven Apel  . Feature Interactions on Steroids: On the Composition of ML Models  . IEEE Software (IEEE-Sw)  , 39(3):120--124, May 2022. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] One of the key differences between traditional software engineering and machine learning (ML) is the lack of specifications for ML models. Traditionally, specifications provide a cornerstone for compositional reasoning and for the divide-and-conquer strategy of how we build large and complex systems from components, but these are hard to come by for machine learned components. While the lack of specification seems like a fundamental new problem at first sight, in fact, software engineers routinely deal with iffy specifications in practice. We face weak specifications, wrong specifications, and unanticipated interactions among specifications. ML may push us further, but the problems are not fundamentally new. Rethinking ML model composition from the perspective of the feature-interaction problem highlights the importance of software design.

In Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR)  , pages 348--352, New York, NY: ACM Press, May 2022. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Talks at practitioner-focused open-source software conferences are a valuable source of information for software engineering researchers. They provide a pulse of the community and are valuable source material for grey literature analysis. We curated a dataset of 24,669 talks from 87 open-source conferences between 2010 and 2021. We stored all relevant metadata from these conferences and provide scripts to collect the transcripts. We believe this data is useful for answering many kinds of questions, such as: What are the important/highly discussed topics within practitioner communities? How do practitioners interact? And how do they present themselves to the public? We demonstrate the usefulness of this data by reporting our findings from two small studies: a topic model analysis providing an overview of open-source community dynamics since 2011 and a qualitative analysis of a smaller community-oriented sample within our dataset to gain a better understanding of why contributors leave open-source software.

[ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Contributors are vital to the sustainability of open source ecosys- tems, and disengagement threatens that sustainability. We seek to protect and strengthen open source communities through a better and more robust way of defining and identifying contributor dis- engagement in open source communities. To do this we, collected a large amount of gray literature on contributor disengagement and performed a qualitative analysis to better our understanding of why contributors disengage.

[ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Open-source software has integrated itself into our daily lives impacting 78% of US companies in 2015. Past studies of open-source community dynamics have found motivations behind contributions and the significance of community engagement, but there are still many aspects not well understood. There’s a direct correlation between the success of an open-source project and the social interactions within its community. Most projects depend on a small group. A study by Avelino et al. on the 133 most popular GitHub projects found that 86% will fail if one or two of its core contributors leave. To sustain open-source we need to better understand how contributors interact, what infor- mation is shared, and what concerns practitioners have. We study common topics, how these have changed over time (2011 - 2021), and what social issues have appeared within open-source commu- nities. Our research is guided by the following questions: (1) How is open-source changing/evolving? (2) What changes do practitioners believe are necessary for open-source to be sustainable? ...

Detecting Interpersonal Conflict in Issues and Code Review: Cross Pollinating Open- and Closed-Source Approaches  . In Proceedings of the Proc.

[ .pdf  , doi  , video  , bib  ] Interpersonal conflict in code review, such as toxic language or an unnecessary pushback, is associated with negative outcomes such as stress and turnover. Automatic detection is one approach to prevent and mitigate interpersonal conflict. Two recent automatic detection approaches were developed in different settings: a toxicity detector using text analytics for open source issue discussions and a pushback detector using logs-based metrics for corporate code reviews. This paper tests how the toxicity detector and the pushback detector can be generalized beyond their respective contexts and discussion types, and how the combination of the two can help improve interpersonal conflict detection. The results reveal connections between the two concepts.

[ .pdf  , doi  , http  , video  , bib  ] The introduction of machine learning (ML) components in software projects has created the need for software engineers to collaborate with data scientists and other specialists. While collaboration can always be challenging, ML introduces additional challenges with its exploratory model development process, additional skills and knowledge needed, difficulties testing ML systems, need for continuous evolution and monitoring, and non-traditional quality requirements such as fairness and explainability. Through interviews with 45 practitioners from 28 organizations, we identified key collaboration challenges that teams face when building and deploying ML systems into production. We report on common collaboration points in the development of production ML systems for requirements, data, and integration, as well as corresponding team patterns and challenges. We find that most of these challenges center around communication, documentation, engineering, and process and collect recommendations to address these challenges

[ .pdf  , doi  , video  , bib  ] Online toxicity is ubiquitous across the internet and its negative impact on the people and online communities it effects has been well documented. However, toxicity manifests differently on various platforms and toxicity in open source communities, while frequently discussed, is not well understood. We take a first stride at understanding the characteristics of open source toxicity to better inform future work designing effective intervention and detection methods. To this end, we curate a sample of 100 toxic GitHub issue discussions combining multiple search and sampling strategies. We then qualitatively analyze the sample to gain an understanding of the characteristics of open-source toxicity. We find that the prevalent forms of toxicity in open source differ from those observed on other platforms like Reddit or Wikipedia. We find some of the most prevalent forms of toxicity in open source are entitled, demanding, and arrogant comments from project users and insults arising from technical disagreements. In addition, not all toxicity was written by people external to the projects, project members were also common authors of toxicity. We also provide in-depth discussions about the implications of our findings including patterns that may be useful for detection work and subsequent questions for future work.

[ .pdf  , doi  , http  , video  , bib  ] Determining whether a configurable software system has a performance bug or the system was misconfigured is often challenging. While there are numerous debugging techniques that can support developers in this task, there is limited empirical evidence of how useful the techniques are to address the actual needs that developers have when debugging the performance of configurable systems; most techniques are often evaluated in terms of technical accuracy instead of their usability. In this paper, we take a human-centered approach to identify, design, implement, and evaluate a solution to support developers in the process of debugging the performance of configurable software systems. We first conduct an exploratory study with 19 developers to identify the information needs that developers have during this process. Subsequently, we design and implement a tailored tool, building on relevant information provided by Global and Local performance-influence models, CPU profiling, and program slicing, to support those needs. Two user studies, with a total of 20 developers, validate and confirm that the information that we provide help developers debug the performance of configurable software systems.

In Proceedings of the 9tn International Workshop on Realizing Artificial Intelligence Synergies in Software Engineering (RAISE)  , pages 114--119, Los Alamitos, CA: IEEE Computer Society, November 2021. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Data scientists commonly use computational notebooks because they provide a good environment for testing multiple models. However, once the scientist completes the code and finds the ideal model, he or she will have to dedicate time to clean up the code in order for others to easily understand it. In this paper, we perform a qualitative study on how scientists clean their code in hopes of being able to suggest a tool to automate this process. Our end goal is for tool builders to address possible gaps and provide additional aid to data scientists, who then can focus more on their actual work rather than the routine and tedious cleaning work. By sampling notebooks from GitHub and analyzing changes between subsequent commits, we identified common cleaning activities, such as changes to markdown (e.g., adding headers sections or descriptions) or comments (both deleting dead code and adding descriptions) as well as reordering cells. We also find that common cleaning activities differ depending on the intended purpose of the notebook. Our results provide a valuable foundation for tool builders and notebook users, as many identified cleaning activities could benefit from codification of best practices and dedicated tool support, possibly tailored depending on intended use.

In Proceedings of the 36th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE)  , pages 304--316, Los Alamitos, CA: IEEE Computer Society, November 2021. Acceptance rate: 27 % (120/440). [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Data scientists reportedly spend a significant amountof their time in their daily routines on data wrangling, i.e., cleaning data and extracting features. However, data wrangling code is often repetitive and error-prone to write. Moreover, itis easy to introduce subtle bugs when reusing and adopting existing code, which result not in crashes but reduce model quality. To support data scientists with data wrangling, we present a technique to generate interactive documentation for data wrangling code. We use (1) program synthesis techniques to automatically summarize data transformations and (2) test case selection techniques to purposefully select representative examples from the data based on execution information collected with tailored dynamic program analysis. We demonstrate that a JupyterLab extension with our technique can provide documentation for many cells in popular notebooks and find in a user study that users with our plugin are faster and more effective at finding realistic bugs in data wrangling code.

Acceptance rate: 24 % (97/396). [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Automatically repairing a bugging program is essentially a search problem, searching for code transformations that pass a set of tests. Various search strategies have been explored, but they either navigate the search space in an ad hoc way using heuristics, or systemically but at the cost of limited edit expressiveness in the kinds of supported program edits. In this work, we explore the possibility of systematically navigating the search space without sacrificing edit expressiveness. The key enabler of this exploration is variational execution, a dynamic analysis technique that has been shown to be effective at exploring many similar executions in large search spaces. We evaluate our approach on IntroClassJava and Defects4J, showing that a systematic search is effective at leveraging and combining fixing ingredients to find patches, including many high-quality patches and multi-edit patches.

Acceptance rate: 24 % (97/396). [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] In collaborative software development, it is considered to be a best practice to submit code changes as a sequence of cohesive commits, each of which records the work result of a specific development activity, such as adding a new feature, bug fixing, and refactoring. However, rather than following this best practice, developers often submit a set of loosely-related changes serving for different development activities as a composite commit, due to the tedious manual work and lack of effective tool support to decompose such a tangled changeset. Composite commits often obfuscate the change history of software artifacts and bring challenges to efficient collaboration among developers. To encourage activity-oriented commits, we propose SmartCommit, a graph-partitioning-based interactive approach to tangled changeset decomposition that leverages not only the efficiency of algorithms but also the knowledge of developers. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we (1) deployed SmartCommit in an international IT company, and analyzed usage data collected from a field study with 83 engineers over 9 months; and (2) conducted a controlled experiment on 3,000 synthetic composite commits from 10 diverse open-source projects. Results show that SmartCommit achieves a median accuracy between 71%–83% when decomposing composite commits without developer involvement, and significantly helps developers follow the best practice of submitting activity-oriented commits with acceptable interaction effort and time cost in real collaborative software development.

Traditionally, specifications provide a cornerstone for compositional reasoning and for the divide-and-conquer strategy of how we build large and complex systems from components, but those are hard to come by for machine-learned components. While the lack of specification seems like a fundamental new problem at first sight, in fact software engineers routinely deal with iffy specifications in practice: we face weak specifications, wrong specifications, and unanticipated interactions among components and their specifications. Machine learning may push us further, but the problems are not fundamentally new. Rethinking machine-learning model composition from the perspective of the feature interaction problem, we may even teach us a thing or two on how to move forward, including the importance of integration testing, of requirements engineering, and of design.

ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)  , 30(4):Article No.: 42, pp 1--56, October 2021. [ .pdf  , http  , bib  ] Open source software projects often rely on package management systems that help projects discover incorporate, and maintain dependencies on other packages, maintained by other people. Such systems save a great deal of effort over adhoc ways of advertising, packaging, and transmitting useful libraries, but coordination among project teams is still needed when one package makes a breaking change affecting other packages. Ecosystems differ in their approaches to breaking changes, and there is no general theory to explain the relationships between features, behavioral norms, ecosystem outcomes, and motivating values. We address this through two empirical studies. In an interview case study we contrast Eclipse, NPM, and CRAN, demonstrating that these different norms for coordination of breaking changes shift the costs of using and maintaining the software among stakeholders, appropriate to each ecosystem’s mission. In a second study, we combine a survey, repository mining, and document analysis to broaden and systematize these observations across 18 ecosystems. We find that all ecosystems share values such as stability and compatibility, but differ in other values. Ecosystems’ practices often support their espoused values, but in surprisingly diverse ways. The data provides counterevidence against easy generalizations about why ecosystem communities do what they do.

[ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] Performance-influence models can help stakeholders understand how and where configuration options and their interactions influence the performance of a system. With this understanding, stakeholders can debug performance and make deliberate configuration decisions. Current black-box techniques to build such models combine various sampling and learning strategies, resulting in trade offs between measurement effort, accuracy, and interpretability. We present Comprex, a white-box approach to build performance-influence models for configurable systems, combining insights of local measurements, dynamic taint analysis to track options in the implementation, compositionality, and compression of the configuration space, without using machine learning to extrapolate incomplete samples. Our evaluation on 4 widely-used open-source projects demonstrates that Comprex builds similarly accurate performance-influence models to the most accurate and expensive black-box approach, but at a reduced cost and with additional benefits from interpretable and local models.

[ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] The large amount of third-party packages available in fast-moving software ecosystems, such as the Node.js/npm, enables attackers to compromise applications by pushing malicious updates to their package dependencies. Studying the npm repository, we observed that many packages perform only simple computations and do not need access to filesystem or network APIs. This offers the opportunity to enforce least-privilege design per package, protecting them from malicious updates. We discuss the design space and propose a lightweight permission system that protects Node.js/npm applications by enforcing package permissions at runtime. Our system makes a large number of packages much harder to be exploited, almost for free.

In Proceedings of the International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation (ICST)  , pages 171--181, Los Alamitos, CA: IEEE Computer Society, April 2021. [ doi  , bib  ] Mutation testing is a fault-based technique commonly used to evaluate the quality of test suites in software systems. It consists of introducing syntactical changes, called mutations, into source code and checking whether the test cases distinguish them. Since there are dozens of distinct mutation types, one of the most challenging problems is the high computational effort required to test the whole test suite against each mutant. Since mutation testing is proposed, researchers have presented techniques aiming at effort reduction in the phases of its process. This study focuses on the potential reduction in the number of mutants provided by a special set of mutants generated by the introduction of two syntactical changes (strongly subsuming second-order mutants). In this work, we exhaustively searched for those second-order mutants Our results show that they (i) are frequently generated by the "expression removal" mutation, (ii) are likely to be killed by the same test cases that kill their constituent mutants, and (iii) have the potential to reduce the number of mutants to be executed by about 22%.

In Proceedings of the 34th Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES)  , pages 778--787, October 2020. [ doi  , bib  ] For configurable systems, features developed and tested separately may present a different behavior when combined in a system. Since software products might be composed of thousands of features, developers should guarantee that all valid combinations work properly. However, features can interact in undesired ways, resulting in failures. A feature interaction is an unpredictable behavior that cannot be easily deduced from the individual features involved. We proposed VarXplorer to inspect feature interactions as they are detected and incrementally classify them as benign or problematic. Our approach provides an iterative analysis of feature interactions allowing developers to focus on suspicious cases. In this paper, we present an experimental study to evaluate our iterative process of tests execution. We aim to understand how VarXplorer could be used for a faster and more objective feature interaction analysis. Our results show that VarXplorer may reduce up to 50% the amount of interactions a developer needs to check during the testing process.

In Proceedings of the 34th Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES)  , pages 193--202, October 2020. [ doi  , bib  ] Developers often use the C preprocessor to handle variability and portability. However, many researchers and practitioners criticize the use of preprocessor directives because of their negative effect on code understanding, maintainability, and error proneness. This negative effect may lead to configuration-related code weaknesses, which appear only when we enable or disable certain configuration options. A weakness is a type of mistake in software that, in proper conditions, could contribute to the introduction of vulnerabilities within that software. Configuration-related code weaknesses may be harder to detect and fix than weaknesses that appear in all configurations, because variability increases complexity. To address this problem, we propose a sampling-based white-box technique to detect configuration-related weaknesses in configurable systems. To evaluate our technique, we performed an empirical study with 24 popular highly configurable systems that make heavy use of the C preprocessor, such as Apache Httpd and Libssh. Using our technique, we detected 57 configuration-related weaknesses in 16 systems. In total, we found occurrences of the following five kinds of weaknesses: 30 memory leaks, 10 uninitialized variables, 9 null pointer dereferences, 6 resource leaks, and 2 buffer overflows. The corpus of these weaknesses is a valuable source to better support further research on configuration-related code weaknesses.

Automated Software Engineering -- An International Journal (AUSE)  , 27:265--300, 2020. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] In configurable software systems, stakeholders are often interested in knowing how configuration options influence the performance of a system to facilitate, for example, the debugging and optimization processes of these systems. There are several black-box approaches to obtain this information, but they either sample the system end-to-end with a large number of configurations to make accurate predictions or miss important performance-influencing interactions when sampling few configurations. In addition, these approaches cannot pinpoint the parts of a program that are responsible for performance differences among configurations. This paper proposes ConfigCrusher, a white-box performance analysis that analyzes the implementation of a system to guide the performance analysis and exploits several insights about configurable systems in the process. ConfigCrusher employs a static data-flow analysis to identify how configuration options may influence control-flow decisions and instruments code regions corresponding to these decisions to dynamically analyze the influence of configuration options on the regions' performance. Our evaluation shows the feasibility of our white-box approach to more efficiently build performance models that are similar to or more accurate than current state-of-the-art approaches on 10 configurable systems. Overall, we showcase the benefits of white-box performance analyses and their potential to outperform black-box approaches and provide additional information for analyzing configurable systems.

Acceptance rate: 28 % (101/360). [ .pdf  , doi  , teaser  , video  , bib  ] Automation tools have become essential in contemporary software development. Tools like continuous integration services, code coverage reporters, style checkers, dependency managers, etc. are all known to provide significant improvements in developer productivity and software quality. Some of these tools are widespread, others are not. How do these automation "best practices" spread? And how might we facilitate the diffusion process for those that have seen slower adoption? In this paper, we rely on a recent innovation in transparency on code hosting platforms like GitHub–the use of repository badges–to track how automation tools spread in open-source ecosystems through different social and technical mechanisms over time. Using a large longitudinal data set, multivariate network science techniques, and survival analysis, we study which socio-technical factors can best explain the observed diffusion process of a number of popular automation tools. Our results show that factors such as social exposure, competition, and observability affect the adoption of tools significantly, and they provide a roadmap for software engineers and researchers seeking to propagate best practices and tools.

Acceptance rate: 28 % (101/360). [ .pdf  , doi  , teaser  , video  , bib  ] Higher-order mutation has the potential for improving major drawbacks of traditional first-order mutation, such as by simulating more realistic faults or improving test optimization techniques. Despite interest in studying promising higher-order mutants, such mutants are difficult to find due to the exponential search space of mutation combinations. State-of-the-art approaches rely on genetic search, which is often incomplete and expensive due to its stochastic nature. First, we propose a novel way of finding a complete set of higher-order mutants by using variational execution, a technique that can, in many cases, explore large search spaces completely and often efficiently. Second, we use the identified complete set of higher-order mutants to study their characteristics. Finally, we use the identified characteristics to design and evaluate a new search strategy, independent of variational execution, that is highly effective at finding higher-order mutants even in large code bases.

[ .pdf  , doi  , video  , bib  ] Feature flags (a.k.a feature toggles) are a mechanism to keep new features hidden behind a boolean option during development. Flags are used for many purposes, such as A/B testing and turning off a feature more easily in case of failures. While software engineering feature flags research is burgeoning, examples of software projects using flags rarely come from outside commercial and private projects, stifling academic progress. To address this gap, in this paper we present a novel mining software repositories approach to detect feature flagging open-source projects, based on analyzing the projects' commit messages. We apply our approach to all open-source GitHub projects, identifying 231,223 candidate feature flagging projects, and manually validating 100. We also report on an initial analysis of feature flags in the validated sample of 100 projects, investigating practices that correlate with shorter flag lifespans (typically desirable to reduce technical debt), such as using the issue tracker and having the flag owner (the developer introducing a flag) also be the one removing it.

[ .pdf  , doi  , video  , bib  ] Developers from open-source communities have reported high stress levels from frequent demands for features and bug fixes and the sometimes aggressive tone of these demands. Toxic conversations may demotivate and burn out developers, creating challenges for sustaining open source. We outline a path toward finding, understanding, and possibly mitigating such unhealthy interactions. We take a first step toward finding them, by developing and demonstrating a measurement instrument (an SVM classifier tailored towards the software engineering domain) to detect toxic discussions in GitHub issues. We used our classifier to analyze trends over time and in different GitHub communities, finding that toxicity varies by community and that toxicity decreased from 2012-2018.

[ .pdf  , doi  , video  , bib  ] Feature flags for continuous deployment and configuration options for customizing software share many similarities, both conceptually and technically. However, neither academic nor practitioner publications seem to distinguish these two concepts. We argue that a distinction is valuable, as applications, goals, and challenges differ fundamentally between feature flags and configuration options. In this work, we explore the differences and commonalities of both concepts to help understand practices and challenges and to help transfer existing solutions (e.g., for testing). To better understand feature flags and how they relate to configuration options, we performed nine semi-structured interviews with feature-flag experts. We discovered a number of distinguishing characteristics but also opportunities for knowledge and technology transfer across both communities. Overall, we think that both communities can learn from each other.

[ .pdf  , doi  , video  , bib  ] Open source is ubiquitous and critical infrastructure, yet funding and sustaining it is challenging. While there are many different funding models for open-source donations and concerted efforts through foundations, donation platforms like Paypal, Patreon, or OpenCollective are popular and low-bar forms to raise funds for open-source development, for which GitHub recently even built explicit support. With a mixed-method study, we explore the emerging and largely unexplored phenomenon of donations in open source: We quantify how commonly open-source projects ask for donations, statistically model characteristics of projects that ask for and receive donations, analyze for what the requested funds are needed and used, and assess whether the received donations achieve the intended outcomes. We find 25,885 projects asking for donations on GitHub, often to support engineering activities; however, we also find no clear evidence that donations influence the activity level of a project. In fact, we find that donations are used in a multitude of ways, raising new research questions about effective funding.

In Proceedings of the 42nd International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)  , pages 445--456, New York, NY: ACM Press, May 2020. Acceptance rate: 21 % (129/617). [ .pdf  , doi  , video  , bib  ] The notion of forking has changed with the rise of distributed version control systems and social coding environments, like GitHub. Traditionally forking refers to splitting off an independent development branch (which we call hard forks); research on hard forks, conducted mostly in pre-GitHub days showed that hard forks were often seen critical as they may fragment a community. Today, in social forking environments, open-source developers are encouraged to fork a project in order to integrate contributions to the community (which we call social forks), which may have also influenced perceptions and practices around hard forks. To revisit hard forks, we identify, study and classify 15,306 hard forks on GitHub and interview 18 owners of hard forks or forked repositories. We find that, among others, hard forks often evolve out of social forks rather than being planned deliberately and that perception about hard forks have indeed changed dramatically, seeing them often as a positive non-competitive alternative to the original project.

Systems with artificial-intelligence or machine-learning (ML) components raise new challenges and require careful engineering. We designed a new course to teach software-engineering skills to students with a background in ML. We specifically go beyond traditional ML courses that teach modeling techniques under artifical conditions and focus, in lecture and assignments, on realism with large and changing datasets robust and evolvable infrastructure, and purposeful requirements engineering that considers also ethics and fairness. We describe the course and our infrastructure and share experience and all material from teaching the course for the first time.

In Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME)  , pages 218--222, September 2019. [ doi  , http  , bib  ] Software developed in different platforms has different characteristics and needs. More specifically, code changes are differently performed in the mobile platform compared to non-mobile platforms (e.g., desktop and Web platforms). Prior works have investigated the differences in specific platforms. However, we still lack a deeper understanding of how code changes evolve across different software platforms. In this paper, we present a study aiming at investigating the frequency of changes and how source code changes, build changes and test changes co-evolve in mobile and non-mobile platforms. We developed linear regression models to explain which factors influence the frequency of changes in different platforms and applied the Apriori algorithm to find types of changes that frequently occur together. Our findings show that non-mobile repositories have a higher number of commits per month compared to mobile and our regression models suggest that being mobile significantly impacts on the number of commits in a negative direction when controlling for confound factors, such as code size. We also found that developers do not usually change source code files together with build files or test files. We argue that our results can provide valuable information for developers on how changes are performed in different platforms so that practices adopted in successful software systems can be followed.

Acceptance rate: 24 % (74/303). [ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] Forking and pull requests have been widely used in open-source communities as a uniform development and contribution mechanisms, which gives developers the flexibility to modify their own fork without affecting others. However, some projects observe severe inefficiencies, including lost and duplicate contributions and fragmented communities. We observed that different communities experience these inefficiencies to widely different degrees and interviewed practitioners indicate several project characteristics and practices, including modularity and coordination mechanisms, that may encourage more efficient forking practices. In this paper, we explore how open-source projects on GitHub differ with regard to forking inefficiencies. Using logistic regression models, we analyzed the association of context factors with the inefficiencies and found that better modularity and centralized management can encourage more contributions and a higher fraction of accepted pull requests, suggesting specific good practices that project maintainers can adopt to reduce forking-related inefficiencies in their community.

We then conduct a conceptual replication study on results from these papers using a triangulation design consisting of a survey with 132 responses, 12 interviews, and two logistic regressions predicting CI abandonment and switching on a dataset of 6,239 GitHub projects. We report and discuss which past results we were able to replicate, those for which we found conflicting evidence, those for which we did not find evidence, and the implications of these cases on future CI research, CI tool builders, and CI users.

Technical Report 1905.09760, arXiv, May 2019. [ .pdf  , http  , bib  ] In many domains, software systems cannot be deployed until authorities judge them fit for use in an intended operating environment. Certification standards and processes have been devised and deployed to regulate operations of software systems and prevent their failures. However, practitioners are often unsatisfied with the efficiency and value proposition of certification efforts. In this study, we compare two certification standards, Common Criteria and DO-178C, and collect insights from literature and from interviews with subject-matter experts to identify design options relevant to the design of standards. The results of the comparison of certification efforts—leading to the identification of design dimensions that affect their quality—serve as a framework to guide the comparison, creation, and revision of certification standards and processes. This paper puts software engineering research in context and discusses key issues around process and quality assurance and includes observations from industry about relevant topics such as recertification, timely evaluations, but also technical discussions around model-driven approaches and formal methods. Our initial characterization of the design space of certification efforts can be used to inform technical discussions and to influence the directions of new or existing certification efforts. Practitioners, technical commissions, and government can directly benefit from our analytical framework.

Overall, this paper showcases the benefits and potential of whitebox performance analyses to outperform black-box approaches and provide additional information for analyzing configurable systems.

Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)  , (24):2410--2437, 2019. [ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] Detecting feature interactions is imperative for accurately predicting performance of highly-configurable systems. State-of-the-art performance prediction techniques rely on supervised machine learning for detecting feature interactions, which, in turn, relies on time-consuming performance measurements to obtain training data. By providing information about potentially interacting features, we can reduce the number of required performance measurements and make the overall performance prediction process more time efficient. We expect that information about potentially interacting features can be obtained by analyzing the source code of a highly-configurable system, which is computationally cheaper than performing multiple performance measurements. To this end, we conducted an in-depth qualitative case study on two real-world systems (mbedTLS and SQLite), in which we explored the relation between internal (precisely control-flow) feature interactions, detected through static program analysis, and external (precisely performance) feature interactions, detected by performance-prediction techniques using performance measurements. We found that a relation exists that can potentially be exploited to predict performance interactions.

In Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems (SEAMS)  , pages 39--50, May 2019. [ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] Modern cyber-physical systems (e.g., robotics systems) are typically composed of physical and software components, the characteristics of which are likely to change over time. Assumptions about parts of the system made at design time may not hold at run time, especially when a system is deployed for long periods (e.g., over decades). Self-adaptation is designed to find reconfigurations of systems to handle such run-time inconsistencies. Planners can be used to find and enact optimal reconfigurations in such an evolving context. However, for systems that are highly configurable, such planning becomes intractable due to the size of the adaptation space. To overcome this challenge, in this paper we explore an approach that (a) uses machine learning to find Pareto-optimal configurations without needing to explore every configuration, and (b) restricts the search space to such configurations to make planning tractable. We explore this in the context of robot missions that need to consider task timeliness and energy consumption. An independent evaluation shows that our approach results in high-quality adaptation plans in uncertain and adversarial environments.

Understanding Similarities and Differences in Software Development Practices Across Domains  . In Proceedings of the 14th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Global Software Engineering (ICGSE)  , pages 74--84, May 2019. [ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] Since software engineering is not a homogeneous whole, we expect that development practices are differently adopted across domains. However, little is known about how practices are followed in different software domains (e.g., healthcare, banking, and Oil and gas). In this paper, we report the results of an exploratory and inductive research, in which we seek differences and similarities regarding the adoption of several practices across 13 domains. We interviewed 19 developers with experience in multiple domains (i.e., cross-domain developers) from large multinational companies, such as Facebook, Google and Macy's. We also run a Web survey to confirm (or not) the interview results. Our findings show that, in fact, different domains adopt practices in a different fashion. We identified that continuous integration practices are interrupted during important commerce periods (e.g., Black Friday) in the financial domains. We also noticed the company's culture and policies strongly influence the adopted practices, instead of the domain itself. Our study also has important implications for practice. For instance, companies should provide targeted training for their development teams and new interdisciplinary courses in software engineering and other domains, such as healthcare, are highly recommended.

[ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] With an increased level of automation provided bypackage managers, which sometimes allow updates to be installedautomatically, malicious package updates are becoming a realthreat in software ecosystems. To address this issue, we proposean approach based on anomaly detection, to identify suspiciousupdates based on security-relevant features that attackers coulduse in an attack. We evaluate our approach in the contextof Node.js/npm ecosystem, to show its feasibility in terms ofreduced review effort and the correct identification of a confirmedmalicious update attack. Although we do not expect it to bea complete solution in isolation, we believe it is an importantsecurity building block for software ecosystems.

In Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Open Source Systems (OSS)  , pages 116--129, May 2019. [ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] Established contributors are the backbone of many free/libre open source software (FLOSS) projects. Previous research has shown that it is critically important to retain contributors and has also revealed motives behind why contributors choose to participate in FLOSS in the first place. However, there has been limited research done on the reasons why established contributors disengage, and factors (on an individual and project level) that predict their disengagement. In this paper, we conduct a mixed-methods empirical study, combining surveys and survival modeling, in order to identify reasons and predictive factors behind established contributor disengagement. We find that different groups of contributors tend to disengage for different reasons, however, overall contributors most commonly cite some kind of transition (e.g., switching jobs or leaving academia). We also find that factors such as the popularity of the projects a contributor works on, whether they have experienced a transition, when they work, and how much they work are all factors that can be used to predict their disengagement from open source.

In Proceedings of the 27th IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER)  , pages 230--241, 2019. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Fork-based development is popular and easy to use, but makes it difficult to maintain an overview of the whole community when the number of forks increases, which leads to redundant development where multiple developers are solving the same problem in parallel without being aware of each other. Redundant development wastes effort for both maintainers and developers. In this paper, we designed an approach to identify redundant code changes in forks as early as possible by extracting clues indicating similarities between code changes, and building a machine learning model to predict redundancies. We evaluated the effectiveness from both the maintainer's and the developer's perspectives. The result shows that we achieve 57%-83% precision for detecting duplicate code changes from maintainer's perspective, and we could save developers' effort of 1.9-3.0 commits on average. Also, we show that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-art.

An Investigation of Misunderstanding Code Patterns in C Open-Source Software Projects  . Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)  , 24(4):1693--1726, August 2019. [ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] Maintenance consumes 40% to 80% of software development costs. So, it is essential to write source code that is easy to understand to reduce the costs with maintenance. Improving code understanding is important because developers often mistake the meaning of code, and misjudge the program behavior, which can lead to errors. There are patterns in source code, such as operator precedence, and comma operator, that have been shown to influence code understanding negatively. Despite initial results, these patterns have not been evaluated in a real-world setting, though. Thus, it is not clear whether developers agree that the patterns studied by researchers can cause substantial misunderstandings in real-world practice. To better understand the relevance of misunderstanding patterns, we applied a mixed research method approach, by performing repository mining and a survey with developers, to evaluate misunderstanding patterns in 50 C open-source projects, including Apache, OpenSSL, and Python. Overall, we found more than 109K occurrences of the 12 patterns in practice. Our study shows that according to developers only some patterns considered previously by researchers may cause misunderstandings. Our results complement previous studies by taking the perception of developers into account.  

   Leo Chen  . Finding Higher Order Mutants Using Variational Execution  . Technical Report 1809.04563, arXiv, September 2018. SPLASH Student research competition. [ .pdf  , http  , bib  ] Mutation testing is an effective but time consuming method for gauging the quality of a test suite. It functions by repeatedly making changes, called mutants, to the source code and checking whether the test suite fails (i.e., whether the mutant is killed). Recent work has shown cases in which applying multiple changes, called a higher order mutation, is more difficult to kill than a single change, called a first order mutation. Specifically, a special kind of higher order mutation, called a strongly subsuming higher order mutation (SSHOM), can enable equivalent accuracy in assessing the quality of the test suite with fewer executions of tests. Little is known about these SSHOMs, as they are difficult to find. Our goal in this research is to identify a faster, more reliable method for finding SSHOMs in order to characterize them in the future. We propose an approach based on variational execution to find SSHOMs. Preliminary results indicate that variational execution performs better than the existing genetic algorithm in terms of speed and completeness of results. Out of a set of 33 first order mutations, our variational execution approach finds all 38 SSHOMs in 4.5 seconds, whereas the genetic algorithm only finds 36 of the 38 SSHOMs in 50 seconds.

[ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] Contemporary software development is characterized by increased reuse and speed. Open source software forges such as GitHub host millions of repositories of libraries and tools, which developers reuse liberally, creating complex and often fragile networks of interdependencies. Hence, developers must make more decisions at a higher speed, finding which libraries to depend on and which projects to contribute to. This decision making process is supported by the transparency provided by social coding platforms like GitHub, where user profile pages display information on a one's contributions, and repository pages provide information on a project's social standing (e.g., through stars and watchers).

SPLASH Student research competition, first place. [ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] Variational execution offers an avenue of efficiently analyzing configurable systems, but data structures like lists require special consideration. We implement automatic substitution of a more efficient list representation in a variational execution framework and evaluate its performance in micro-benchmarks. The results suggest that the substitution may offer substantial performance improvements to programs involving highly variational lists.

In Proceedings of the 17th ACM International Conference on Generative Programming and Component Engineering (GPCE)  , pages 41--52, New York, NY: ACM Press, 2018. [ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] In highly configurable systems, features may interact unexpectedly and produce faulty behavior. Those faults are not easily identified from the analysis of each feature separately, especially when feature specifications are missing. We propose VarXplorer, a dynamic and iterative approach to detect suspicious interactions. It provides information on how features impact the control and data flow of the program. VarXplorer supports developers with a graph that visualizes this information, mainly showing suppress and require relations between features. To evaluate whether VarXplorer helps improve the performance of identifying suspicious interactions, we perform a controlled study with 24 subjects. We find that with our proposed feature-interaction graphs, participants are able to identify suspicious interactions more than 3 times faster compared to the state-of-the-art tool.

Automated Software Engineering -- An International Journal (AUSE)  , 26(1):59--85, March 2019. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] In software testing, different testers focus on different aspects of the software such as functionality, performance, design, and other attributes. While many tools and coverage metrics exist to support testers at the code level, not much support is targeted for testers who want to inspect the output of a program such as a dynamic web application. To support this category of testers, we propose a family of output-coverage metrics (similar to statement branch, and path coverage metrics on code) that measure how much of the possible output has been produced by a test suite and what parts of the output are still uncovered. To do that, we first approximate the output universe using our existing symbolic execution technique. Then, given a set of test cases, we map the produced outputs onto the output universe to identify the covered and uncovered parts and compute output-coverage metrics. In our empirical evaluation on seven real-world PHP web applications, we show that selecting test cases by output coverage is more effective at identifying presentation faults such as HTML validation errors and spelling errors than selecting test cases by traditional code coverage. In addition, to help testers understand output coverage and augment test cases, we also develop a tool called WebTest that displays the output universe in one single web page and allows testers to visually explore covered and uncovered parts of the output.

ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)  , 27(4):Article No. 18, 2018. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] The advent of variability management and generator technology enables users to derive individual system variants from a configurable code base by selecting desired configuration options. This approach gives rise to the generation of possibly billions of variants, which, however, cannot be efficiently analyzed for bugs and other properties with classic analysis techniques. To address this issue, researchers and practitioners have developed sampling heuristics and, recently, variability-aware analysis techniques. While sampling reduces the analysis effort significantly, the information obtained is necessarily incomplete, and it is unknown whether state-of-the-art sampling techniques scale to billions of variants. Variability-aware analysis techniques process the configurable code base directly, exploiting similarities among individual variants with the goal of reducing analysis effort. However, while being promising, so far, variability-aware analysis techniques have been applied mostly only to small academic examples. To learn about the mutual strengths and weaknesses of variability-aware and sample-based static-analysis techniques, we compared the two by means of seven concrete control-flow and data-flow analyses, applied to five real-world subject systems: BusyBox, OpenSSL, SQLite, the x86 Linux kernel, and uclibc. In particular, we compare the efficiency (analysis execution time) of the static analyses and their effectiveness (potential bugs found). Overall, we found that variability-aware analysis outperforms most sample-based static-analysis techniques with respect to efficiency and effectiveness. For example, checking all variants of OpenSSL with a variability-aware static analysis is faster than checking even only two variants with an analysis that does not exploit similarities among variants.

Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages, Issue OOPSLA (OOPSLA)  , 2:117:1--117:30, 2018. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Variational execution is a novel dynamic analysis technique for exploring highly configurable systems and accurately tracking information flow. It is able to efficiently analyze many configurations by aggressively sharing redundancies of program executions. The idea of variational execution has been demonstrated to be effective in exploring variations in the program, especially when the configuration space grows out of control. Existing implementations of variational execution often require heavy lifting of the runtime interpreter which is painstaking and error-prone. Furthermore, the performance of this approach is suboptimal. For example, the state-of-the-art variational execution interpreter for Java, VarexJ, slows down executions by 100 to 800~times over a single execution for small to medium size Java programs. Instead of modifying existing JVMs, we propose to transform existing bytecode to make it variational, so it can be executed on an unmodified commodity JVM. Our evaluation shows a dramatic improvement on performance over the state-of-the-art, with a speedup of 2 to 46 times, and high efficiency in sharing computations.

IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE)  , 46(4):442--462, April 2018. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Program comprehension is an important, but hard to measure cognitive process. This makes it difficult to provide suitable programming languages, tools, or coding conventions to support developers in their everyday work. Here, we explore whether functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is feasible for soundly measuring program comprehension. To this end, we observed 17 participants inside an fMRI scanner while they were comprehending source code. The results show a clear, distinct activation of five brain regions, which are related to working memory, attention, and language processing, which all fit well to our understanding of program comprehension. Furthermore, we found reduced activity in the default mode network, indicating the cognitive effort necessary for program comprehension. We also observed that familiarity with Java as underlying programming language reduced cognitive effort during program comprehension. To gain confidence in the results and the method, we replicated the study with 11 new participants and largely confirmed our findings. Our results encourage us and, hopefully, others to use fMRI to observe programmers and, in the long run, answer questions, such as: How should we train programmers? Can we train someone to become an excellent programmer? How effective are new languages and tools for program comprehension?

[ .pdf  , http  , bib  ] One of the main challenges of debugging is to understand why the program fails for certain inputs but succeeds for others. This becomes especially difficult if the fault is caused by an interaction of multiple inputs. To debug such interaction faults, it is necessary to understand the individual effect of the input, how these inputs interact and how these interactions cause the fault. The differences between two execution traces can explain why one input behaves differently than the other. We propose to compare execution traces of all input options to derive explanations of the behavior of all options and interactions among them. To make the relevant information stand out, we represent them as variational traces that concisely represents control-flow and data-flow differences among multiple concrete traces. While variational traces can be obtained from brute-force execution of all relevant inputs, we use variational execution to scale the generation of variational traces to the exponential space of possible inputs. We further provide an Eclipse plugin Varviz that enables users to use variational traces for debugging and navigation. In a user study, we show that users of variational traces are more than twice as fast to finish debugging tasks than users of the standard Eclipse debugger. We further show that variational traces can be scaled to programs with many options

Acceptance rate: 21 % (61/289). [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Most software systems provide options that allow users to tailor the system in terms of functionality and qualities. The increased flexibility raises challenges for understanding the configuration space and the effects of options and their interactions on performance and other non-functional properties. To identify how options and interactions affect the performance of a system, several sampling and learning strategies have been recently proposed. However, existing approaches usually assume a fixed environment (hardware, workload, version) such that learning has to be repeated when the environment changes. Repeating learning and measurement for each environment is expensive and often practically infeasible. Instead, we pursue a strategy that transfers knowledge across environments, but sidesteps heavyweight and expensive transfer-learning strategies. Based on empirical insights about common relationships regarding (i) influential options, (ii) their interactions, and (iii) their performance distributions, our approach L2S  (Learning to Sample) selects better samples in the target environment based on information from the source environment. It progressively shrinks the configuration space and adaptively concentrates on interesting regions of the configuration space. With both synthetic benchmarks and several real systems, we demonstrate that L2S  outperforms state of the art performance learning and transfer-learning approaches in terms of measurement effort and learning accuracy.

Evaluating Domain-Specific Metric Thresholds: An Empirical Study  . In Proceedings of the International Conference on Technical Debt (TechDebt)  , pages 41--50, New York, NY: ACM Press, May 2018. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Software metrics and thresholds provide means to quantify several quality attributes of software systems. Indeed, they have been used in a wide variety of methods and tools for detecting different sorts of technical debts, such as code smells. Unfortunately, these methods and tools do not take into account characteristics of software domains, as the intrinsic complexity of geo-localization and scientific software systems or the simple protocols employed by messaging applications. Instead, they rely on generic thresholds that are derived from heterogeneous systems. Although derivation of reliable thresholds has long been a concern, we still lack empirical evidence about threshold variation across distinct software domains. To tackle this limitation, this paper investigates whether and how thresholds vary across domains by presenting a large-scale study on 3,107 software systems from 15 domains. We analyzed the derivation and distribution of thresholds based on 8 well-known source code metrics. As a result, we observed that software domain and size are relevant factors to be considered when building benchmarks for threshold derivation. Moreover, we also observed that domain-specific metric thresholds are more appropriated than generic ones for code smell detection.

[ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Continuous Integration (CI) services, which can automatically build test, and deploy software projects, are an invaluable asset in distributed teams, increasing productivity and helping to maintain code quality. Prior work has shown that CI pipelines can be sophisticated and choosing and configuring a CI system involves tradeoffs. As CI technology matures, new CI tool offerings arise to meet the distinct wants and needs of software teams, as they negotiate a path through these tradeoffs, depending on their context. In this paper, we begin to uncover these nuances, and tell the story of open-source projects falling out of love with Travis, the earliest and most popular cloud-based CI system. Using logistic regression we quantify the effects that open-source community factors and project technical factors have on the rate of Travis abandonment. We find that increased build complexity reduces the chances of abandonment, that larger projects abandon at higher rates, and that a project’s dominant language has significant but varying effects. Finally, we find the surprising result that metrics of configuration attempts and knowledge dispersion in the project do not affect the rate of abandonment.

[ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Previous research shows that developers spend most of their time understanding code. Despite the importance of code understandability for maintenance-related activities, an objective measure of it remains an elusive goal. Recently, Scalabrino et al. reported on an experiment with 46 Java developers designed to evaluate metrics for code understandability. The authors collected and analyzed data on more than a hundred features describing the code snippets, the developers’ experience, and the developers’ performance on a quiz designed to assess understanding. They concluded that none of the metrics considered can individually capture understandability. Expecting that understandability is better captured by a combination of multiple features, we present a reanalysis of the data from the Scalabrino et al. study, in which we use different statistical modeling techniques. Our models suggest that some computed features of code, such as those arising from syntactic structure and documentation have a small but significant correlation with understandability. Further, we construct a binary classifier of understandability based on various interpretable code features, which has a small amount of discriminating power. Our encouraging results, based on a small data set, suggest that a useful metric of understandability could feasibly be created, but more data is needed.

International Journal on Software and Systems Modeling (SOSYM)  , 18(3):2265--2283, 2019. [ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] Modeling the performance of a highly-configurable software system requires capturing the influences of its configuration options and their interactions on the system's performance. Performance-influence models quantify these influences, explaining this way the performance behavior of a configurable system as a whole. To be useful in practice, a performance-influence model should have a low prediction error, small model size, and reasonable computation time. Because of the inherent tradeoffs among these properties, optimizing for one property may negatively influence the others. It is unclear, though, to what extent these tradeoffs manifest themselves in practice, that is, whether a large configuration space can be described accurately only with large models and significant resource investment. By means of 10 real-world highly-configurable systems from different domains, we have systematically studied the tradeoffs between the three properties. Surprisingly, we found that the tradeoffs between prediction error and model size and between prediction error and computation time are rather marginal. That is, we can learn accurate and small models in reasonable time, so that one performance-influence model can fit different use cases, such as program comprehension and performance prediction. We further investigated the reasons for why the tradeoffs are marginal. We found that interactions among four or more configuration options have only a minor influence on the prediction error and that ignoring them when learning a performance-influence model can save a substantial amount of computation time, while keeping the model small without considerably increasing the prediction error. This is an important insight for new sampling and learning techniques as they can focus on specific regions of the configuration space and find a sweet spot between accuracy and effort. We further analyzed the causes for the configuration options and their interactions having the observed influences on the systems' performance. We were able to identify several patterns across subject systems, such as dominant configuration options and data pipelines, that explain the influences of highly influential configuration options and interactions, and give further insights into the domain of highly-configurable systems.

Technical Report 1712.07440, arXiv, December 2017. [ .pdf  , http  , bib  ] Detecting feature interactions is imperative for accurately predicting performance of highly-configurable systems. State-of-the-art performance prediction techniques rely on supervised machine learning for detecting feature interactions, which, in turn, relies on time consuming performance measurements to obtain training data. By providing information about potentially interacting features, we can reduce the number of required performance measurements and make the overall performance prediction process more time efficient. We expect that the information about potentially interacting features can be obtained by statically analyzing the source code of a highly-configurable system, which is computationally cheaper than performing multiple performance measurements. To this end, we conducted a qualitative case study in which we explored the relation between control-flow feature interactions (detected through static program analysis) and performance feature interactions (detected by performance prediction techniques using performance measurements). We found that a relation exists, which can potentially be exploited to predict performance interactions.

[ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] In fast-paced, reuse-heavy software development, the transparency provided by social coding platforms like GitHub is essential to decision making. Developers infer the quality of projects using visible cues, known as signals, collected from personal profile and repository pages. We report on a large-scale, mixed-methods empirical study of npm packages that explores the emerging phenomenon of repository badges, with which maintainers signal underlying qualities about the project to contributors and users. We investigate which qualities maintainers intend to signal and how well badges correlate with those qualities. After surveying developers, mining 294,941 repositories, and applying statistical modeling and time series analysis techniques, we find that non-trivial badges, which display the build status, test coverage, and up-to-dateness of dependencies, are mostly reliable signals, correlating with more tests, better pull requests, and fresher dependencies. Displaying such badges correlates with best practices, but the effects do not always persist.

[ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] Fork-based development has been widely used both in open source community and industry, because it gives developers flexibility to modify their own fork without affecting others. Unfortunately, this mechanism has downsides; when the number of forks becomes large, it is difficult for developers to get or maintain an overview of activities in the forks. Current tools provide little help. We introduced INFOX, an approach to automatically identifies not-merged features in forks and generates an overview of active forks in a project. The approach clusters cohesive code fragments using code and network analysis techniques and uses information-retrieval techniques to label clusters with keywords. The clustering is effective, with 90% accuracy on a set of known features. In addition, a human-subject evaluation shows that INFOX can provide actionable insight for developers of forks.

[ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] Features in highly configurable systems can interact in undesiredways which may result in faults. However, most interactions arenot easily detectable as specifications of feature interactions areusually missing. In this paper, we aim to detect interactions and tohelp create feature-interaction specifications. We use variational ex-ecution to observe internal interactions on control and data flow ofhighly configurable systems. The number of potential interactionscan be large and hard to understand, especially as many interac-tions are benign. To help developers understand these interactions,we propose feature-interaction graphs as a concise representationof all pairwise interactions. We provide two analyses that reportsuspicious interactions, namely suppress and require interactionsFinally, we propose a specification language that enables develop-ers to define different kinds of allowed and forbidden interactions.Our tool, VarXplorer, provides a visualization of feature-interactiongraphs and supports the creation of feature interaction specifi-cations. VarXplorer also provides an iterative analysis of featureinteractions allowing developers to focus on suspicious cases.

Automated Software Engineering -- An International Journal (AUSE)  , 25(2):279--313, 2018. [ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] While the creation of new branches and forks is easy and fast with modern version-control systems, merging is often time-consuming. Especially when dealing with many branches or forks, a prediction of merge costs based on lightweight indicators would be desirable to help developers recognize problematic merging scenarios before potential conflicts become too severe in the evolution of a complex software project. We analyze the predictive power of several indicators, such as the number, size or scattering degree of commits in each branch, derived either from the version-control system or directly from the source code. Based on a survey of 41 developers, we inferred 7 potential indicators to predict the number of merge conflicts. We tested corresponding hypotheses by studying 163 open-source projects, including 21,488 merge scenarios and comprising 49,449,773 lines of code. A notable (negative) result is that none of the 7 indicators suggested by the participants of the developer survey has a predictive power concerning the frequency of merge conflicts. We discuss this and other findings as well as perspectives thereof.

[ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Highly configurable software systems are pervasive, although configuration options and their interactions raise complexity of the program and increase maintenance effort. Especially load-time configuration options, such as parameters from command-line options or configuration files, are used with standard programming constructs such as variables and if-statements intermixed with the program’s implementation; manually tracking configuration options from the time they are loaded to the point where they may influence control-flow decisions is tedious and error prone. We design and implement LOTRACK , an extended static taint analysis to track configuration options automatically. LOTRACK derives a configuration map that explains for each code fragment under which configurations it may be executed. An evaluation on Android apps and Java applications from different domains shows that LOTRACK yields high accuracy with reasonable performance. We use LOTRACK to empirically characterize how much of the implementation of Android apps depends on the platform’s configuration options or interactions of these options.

Acceptance rate: 32 % (18/56). [ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] Build systems are crucial for software system development however there is a lack of tool support to help with their high maintenance overhead. GNU Autotools are widely used in the open source community, but users face various challenges from its hard to comprehend nature and staging of multiple code generation steps, often leading to low quality and error-prone build code. In this paper, we present a platform AutoHaven to provide a foundation for developers to create analysis tools to help them understand, maintain and migrate their GNU Autotools build systems. Internally it uses approximate parsing and symbolic analysis of the build logic. We illustrate the use of the platform with two tools: ACSense helps developers to better understand their build systems and ACSniff detects build smells to improve build code quality. Our evaluation shows that AutoHaven can support most GNU Autotools build systems and can detect build smells in the wild.

Transfer Learning for Performance Modeling of Configurable Systems: An Exploratory Analysis  .

Acceptance rate: 23 % (88/388). [ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] Modern software systems provide many configuration options which not only influence their functionality but also non-functional properties such as response-time. To understand and predict the effect of configuration options, several sampling analysis, and learning strategies have been proposed, albeit often with significant cost to cover the highly dimensional configuration space. Recently, transfer learning has been applied to reduce the effort of constructing performance models by transferring knowledge about performance behavior across environments. While this line of research is promising to learn more accurate models at lower cost, it is unclear until now why and when transfer learning works for performance modeling and analysis in highly configurable systems. To shed light on when it is beneficial to apply transfer learning, we conducted an empirical study on four popular software systems, varying software configurations and environmental conditions, such as hardware, workload, and software versions, to identify the key knowledge pieces that can be exploited for transfer learning. Our results show that in small environmental changes (e.g., homogeneous workload change), by applying a linear transformation to the performance model of the source environment, we can understand the performance behavior of the target environment, while for severe environmental changes (e.g., drastic workload change) we can transfer only knowledge that makes sampling in the target environment more efficient, e.g., by reducing the dimensionality of the configuration space.

Acceptance rate: 23 % (88/388). [ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] Diffing and merging of source-code artifacts is an essential task when integrating changes in software versions. While state-of-the-art line-based tools (e.g., git merge) are fast and independent of the programming language used, they have only a low precision. Recently, it has been shown that the precision of merging can be substantially improved by using a language-aware structured approach that works on abstract syntax trees. But, precise structured merging is NP hard, especially, when considering the notoriously difficult scenarios of renamings and shifted code. To address these scenarios without compromising scalability, we propose a syntax-aware, heuristic optimization for structured merging that employs a lookahead mechanism during tree matching. The key idea is that renamings and shifted code are not arbitrarily distributed but their occurrence follows patterns, which we address with a syntax-specific lookahead. Our experiments with 48 real-world open-source projects (4878 merge scenarios with over 400 million lines of code) demonstrate that we can significantly improve matching precision in 28 percent while maintaining performance.

Measuring Neural Efficiency of Program Comprehension  . In Proceedings of the European Software Engineering Conference and ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (ESEC/FSE)  , pages 140--150, New York, NY: ACM Press, September 2017. [ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] Most modern software programs cannot be understood in their entirety by a single programmer. Instead, programmers must rely on a set of cognitive processes that aid in seeking, filtering, and shaping relevant information for a given programming task. Several theories have been proposed to explain these processes, such as “beacons,” for locating relevant code, and “plans,” for encoding cognitive models. However, these theories are decades old and lack validation with modern cognitive-neuroscience methods. In this paper, we report on a study using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with 11 participants who performed program comprehension tasks. We manipulated experimental conditions related to beacons and layout to isolate specific cognitive processes related to bottom-up comprehension and comprehension based on semantic cues. We found evidence of semantic chunking during bottom-up comprehension and lower activation of brain areas during comprehension based on semantic cues, confirming that beacons ease comprehension.  

   Christian Kästner  . Differential Testing for Variational Analyses: Experience from Developing KConfigReader  . Technical Report 1706.09357, arXiv, June 2017. [ .pdf  , http  , bib  ] Differential testing to solve the oracle problem has been applied in many scenarios where multiple supposedly equivalent implementations exist, such as multiple implementations of a C compiler. If the multiple systems disagree on the output for a given test input, we have likely discovered a bug without every having to specify what the expected output is. Research on variational analyses (or variability-aware or family-based analyses) can benefit from similar ideas. The goal of most variational analyses is to perform an analysis, such as type checking or model checking, over a large number of configurations much faster than an existing traditional analysis could by analyzing each configuration separately. Variational analyses are very suitable for differential testing, since the existence nonvariational analysis can provide the oracle for test cases that would otherwise be tedious or difficult to write. In this experience paper, I report how differential testing has helped in developing KConfigReader, a tool for translating the Linux kernel's kconfig model into a propositional formula. Differential testing allows us to quickly build a large test base and incorporate external tests that avoided many regressions during development and made KConfigReader likely the most precise kconfig extraction tool available.

[ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] Transparent environments and social-coding platforms as GitHub help developers to stay abreast of changes during the development and maintenance phase of a project. Especially, notification feeds can help developers to learn about relevant changes in other projects. Unfortunately, transparent environments can quickly overwhelm developers with too many notifications, such that they loose the important ones in a sea of noise. Complementing existing prioritization and filtering strategies based on binary compatibility and code ownership, we develop an anomaly-detection mechanism to identify unusual commits in a repository, that stand out with respect to other changes in the same repository or by the same developer. Among others, we detect exceptionally large commits, commits at unusual times, and commits touching rarely changed file types given the characteristics of a particular repository or developer. We automatically flag unusual commits on GitHub through a browser plugin. In an interactive survey with 173 active GitHub users, rating commits in a project of their interest, we found that, though our unusual score is only a weak predictor of whether developers want to be notified about a commit information about unusual characteristics of a commit change how developers regard commits. Our anomaly-detection mechanism is a building block for scaling transparent environments.

Acceptance rate: 23 % (14/61). [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Modern software systems are now being built to be used in dynamic environments utilizing configuration capabilities to adapt to changes and external uncertainties. In a self-adaptation context, we are often interested in reasoning about the performance of the systems under different configurations. Usually, we learn a black-box model based on real measurements to predict the performance of the system given a specific configuration. However, as modern systems become more complex, there are many configuration parameters that may interact and, therefore, we end up learning an exponentially large configuration space. Naturally, this does not scale when relying on real measurements in the actual changing environment. We propose a different solution: Instead of taking the measurements from the real system, we learn the model using samples from other sources, such as simulators that approximate performance of the real system at low cost. We define a cost model that transform the traditional view of model learning into a multi-objective problem that not only takes into account model accuracy but also measurements effort as well. We evaluate our cost-aware transfer learning solution using real world configurable software including (i) a robotic system, (ii) 3 different stream processing applications, and (iii) a NoSQL database system. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve (a) high prediction accuracy as well as (b) high model reliability with only few samples from the target environment.

Discipline Matters: Refactoring of Preprocessor Directives in the #ifdef Hell  . IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE)  , 44(5):453--469, May 2018. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] The C preprocessor is used in many C projects to support variability and portability. However, researchers and practitioners criticize the C preprocessor because of its negative effect on code understanding and maintainability and its error proneness. More importantly, the use of the preprocessor hinders the development of tool support that is standard in other languages, such as automated refactoring. Developers aggravate these problems when using the preprocessor in undisciplined ways (e.g., conditional blocks that do not align with the syntactic structure of the code). In this article, we proposed a catalogue of refactorings and we evaluated the number of application possibilities of the refactorings in practice, the opinion of developers about the usefulness of the refactorings, and whether the refactorings preserve behavior. Overall, we found 5670 application possibilities for the refactorings in 63 real-world C projects. In addition, we performed an online survey among 246 developers, and we submitted 28 patches to convert undisciplined directives into disciplined ones. According to our results, 63% of developers prefer to use the refactored (i.e., disciplined) version of the code instead of the original code with undisciplined preprocessor usage. To verify that the refactorings are indeed behavior preserving, we applied them to more than 36 thousand programs generated automatically using a model of a subset of the C language, running the same test cases in the original and refactored programs. Furthermore, we applied the refactorings to three real-world projects: BusyBox OpenSSL, and SQLite. This way, we detected and fixed a few behavioral changes, 62% caused by unspecified behavior in the C programming language.

In Proceedings of the 11st Int'l Workshop on Variability Modelling of Software-Intensive Systems (VaMoS)  , pages 28--35, 2017. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Many applications require not only representing variability in software and data, but also computing with it. To do so efficiently requires variational data structures that make the variability explicit in the underlying data and the operations used to manipulate it. Variational data structures have been developed ad hoc for many applications, but there is little general understanding of how to design them or what tradeoffs exist among them. In this paper, we take a first step towards a more systematic exploration and analysis of a variational data structure. We want to know how different design decisions affect the performance and scalability of a variational data structure, and what properties of the underlying data and operation sequences need to be considered. Specifically, we study several alternative designs of a variational stack, a data structure that supports efficiently representing and computing with multiple variants of a plain stack, and that is a common building block in many algorithms. The different variational stacks are presented as a small product line organized by three design decisions. We analyze how these design decisions affect the performance of a variational stack with different usage profiles. Finally, we evaluate how these design decisions affect the performance of the variational stack in a real-world scenario: in the interpreter VarexJ when executing real software containing variability.

In Proceedings of the 4rd International Workshop on Release Engineering (Releng)  , pages 12--15, New York, NY: ACM Press, November 2016. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] GNU Autotools is a widely used build tool in the open source community. As open source projects grow more complex maintaining their build systems becomes more challenges due to the lack of tool support. Here we propose a platform to mitigate this problem, and aid developers by providing a platform to build support tools for GNU Autotools build systems. The platform would provide an abstract approximation for the build system to be used in different analysis techniques.

[ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Quality assurance for highly-configurable systems is challenging due to the exponentially growing configuration space. Interactions among multiple options can lead to surprising behaviors, bugs, and security vulnerabilities. Analyzing all configurations systematically might be possible though if most options do not interact or interactions follow specific patterns that can be exploited by analysis tools. To better understand interactions in practice, we analyze program traces to identify where interactions occur on control flow and data. To this end, we developed a dynamic analysis for Java based on variability-aware execution and monitor executions of multiple mid-sized real-world programs. We find that the essential configuration complexity of these programs is indeed much lower than the combinatorial explosion of the configuration space indicates, but also that the interaction characteristics that allow scalable and complete analyses are more nuanced than what is exploited by existing state-of-the-art quality assurance strategies.

In Proceedings of the IJCAI Workshop on Autonomous Mobile Service Robots (WSR)  , , July 2016. [ .pdf  , http  , bib  ] There has been a considerable growth in research and development of service robots in recent years. For deployment in diverse environment conditions for a wide range of service tasks, novel features and algorithms are developed and existing ones undergo change. However, developing and evolving the robot software requires making and revising many design decisions that can affect the quality of performance of the robots and that are non-trivial to reason about intuitively because of interactions among them. We propose to use sensitivity analysis to build models of the quality of performance to the different design decisions to ease design and evolution. Moreover we envision these models to be used for run-time adaptation in response to changing goals or environment conditions. Constructing these models is challenging due to the exponential size of the decision space. We build on previous work on performance influence models of highly-configurable software systems using a machine-learning-based approach to construct influence models for robotic software.

[ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] Change introduces conflict into software ecosystems: breaking changes may ripple through the ecosystem and trigger rework for users of a package, but often developers can invest additional effort or accept opportunity costs to alleviate or delay downstream costs. We performed a multiple case study of three software ecosystems with different tooling and philosophies toward change, Eclipse, R/CRAN, and Node.js/npm to understand how developers make decisions about change and change-related costs and what practices, tooling, and policies are used. We found that all three ecosystems differ substantially in their practices and expectations toward change and that those differences can be explained largely by different community values in each ecosystem. Our results illustrate that there is a large design space in how to build an ecosystem, its policies and its supporting infrastructure; and there is value in making community values and accepted tradeoffs explicit and transparent in order to resolve conflicts and negotiate change-related costs.

[ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Preprocessors support the diversification of software products with #ifdefs, but also require additional effort from developers to maintain and understand variable code. We conjecture that #ifdefs cause developers to produce more vulnerable code because they are required to reason about multiple features simultaneously and maintain complex mental models of dependencies of configurable code. We extracted a variational call graph across all configurations of the Linux kernel, and used configuration complexity metrics to compare vulnerable and non-vulnerable functions considering their vulnerability history. Our goal was to learn about whether we can observe a measurable influence of configuration complexity on the occurrence of vulnerabilities. Our results suggest, among others, that vulnerable functions have higher variability than non-vulnerable ones and are also constrained by fewer configuration options. This suggests that developers are inclined to notice functions appear in frequently-compiled product variants. We aim to raise developers’ awareness to address variability more systematically, since configuration complexity is an important but often ignored aspect of software product lines.

[ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] The Android platform is designed to support mutually untrusted third-party apps, which run as isolated processes but may interact via platform-controlled mechanisms, called Intents. Interactions among third-party apps are intended and can contribute to a rich user experience, for example, the ability to share pictures from one app with another. The Android platform presents an interesting point in a design space of module systems that is biased toward isolation, extensibility, and untrusted contributions. The Intent mechanism essentially provides message channels among modules in which the set of message types is extensible. However the module system has design limitations including the lack of consistent mechanisms to document message types, very limited checking that a message conforms to its specification, the inability to explicitly declare dependencies on other modules, and the lack of checks for backward compatibility as message types evolve over time. In order to understand the degree to which these design limitations result in real issues, we studied a broad corpus of apps and cross-validated our results against app documentation and Android support forums. Our findings suggest that design limitations do indeed cause development problems. Based on our results we outline further research questions and propose possible mitigation strategies..

[ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Almost every software system provides configuration options to tailor the system to the target platform and application scenario. Often, this configurability renders the analysis of every individual system configuration infeasible. To address this problem, researchers proposed a diverse set of sampling algorithms. We present a comparative study of 10 state-of-the-art sampling algorithms regarding their fault-detection capability and size of sample sets. The former is important to improve software quality and the latter to reduce the time of analysis. In a nutshell, we found that the sampling algorithms with larger sample sets detected higher numbers of faults. Furthermore, we observed that the limiting assumptions made in previous work influence the number of detected faults, the size of sample sets, and the ranking of algorithms. Finally, we identified a number of technical challenges when trying to avoid the limiting assumptions, which question the practicality of certain sampling algorithms.

[ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] Today’s social coding tools foreshadow a transformation of the software industry, as it increasingly relies on open libraries, frameworks, and code fragments. Our vision calls for new “intelligently transparent” services that support rapid development of innovative products while managing risk and receiving early warnings of looming failures. Intelligent transparency is enabled by an infrastructure that applies analytics to data from all phases of the lifecycle of open source projects, from development to deployment, bringing stakeholders the information they need when they need it.

In Proceedings of the ASE Workshop on Software Support for Collaborative and Global Software Engineering (SCGSE)  , pages 86--89, November 2015. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Dependencies among software projects and libraries are an indicator of the often implicit collaboration among many developers in software ecosystems. Negotiating change can be tricky: changes to one module may cause ripple effects to many other modules that depend on it, yet insisting on only backward-compatible changes may incur significant opportunity cost and stifle change. We argue that awareness mechanisms based on various notions of stability can enable developers to make decisions that are independent yet wise and provide stewardship rather than disruption to the ecosystem. In ongoing interviews with developers in two software ecosystems (CRAN and Node.js), we are finding that developers in fact struggle with change, that they often use adhoc mechanisms to negotiate change, and that existing awareness mechanisms like Github notification feeds are rarely used due to information overload. We study the state of the art and current information needs and outline a vision toward a change-based awareness system.

In Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Mobile Development Lifecycle (MobileDeLi)  , pages 28--34, October 2015. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Smart home automation and IoT promise to bring many advantages but they also expose their users to certain security and privacy vulnerabilities. For example, leaking the information about the absence of a person from home or the medicine somebody is taking may have serious security and privacy consequences for home users and potential legal implications for providers of home automation and IoT platforms. We envision that a new ecosystem within an existing smartphone ecosystem will be a suitable platform for distribution of apps for smart home and IoT devices. Android is increasingly becoming a popular platform for smart home and IoT devices and applications. Built-in security mechanisms in ecosystems such as Android have limitations that can be exploited by malicious apps to leak users’ sensitive data to unintended recipients. For instance, Android enforces that an app requires the Internet permission in order to access a web server but it does not control which servers the app talks to or what data it shares with other apps. Therefore sub-ecosystems that enforce additional fine-grained custom policies on top of existing policies of the smartphone ecosystems are necessary for smart home or IoT platforms. To this end, we have built a tool that enforces additional policies on inter-app interactions and permissions of Android apps. We have done preliminary testing of our tool on three proprietary apps developed by a future provider of a home automation platform. Our initial evaluation demonstrates that it is possible to develop mechanisms that allow definition and enforcement of custom security policies appropriate for ecosystems of the like smart home automation and IoT.

In Proceedings of the International Symposium on Foundations of Software Engineering -- New Ideas Track (ESEC/FSE-NIER)  , pages 926--929, New York, NY: ACM Press, August 2015. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] In collaborative software development, when two or more developers incorporate their changes, a merge conflict may arise if the changes are incompatible. Previous research has shown that such conflicts are common and occur as textual conflicts or build/test failure, i.e., semantic conflicts. When a merge conflict occurs for a large number of parallel changes, it is desirable to identify the actual (minimum) set of changes that directly results in the conflict. Pinpointing the specific conflicting changes directly leading to test failure facilitates quick accountability and correction from developers. For semantic conflicts, to identify such subset of the changes is challenging. A naive approach trying all possible subsets would not scale due to the exponential number of possible combinations. We propose Semex, a novel approach to detect semantic conflicts using variability-aware execution. In the first step, we encode all parallel changes into a single program with variability in which we use symbolic variables to represent whether a given change is applied to the original program. In the second step, we run the test cases via variability-aware execution. Variability-aware execution explores all possible executions of the combined program with regard to all possible values of the symbolic variables representing all changes and returns a propositional formula over the set of variables repre- senting the condition in which a test case fails. Due to our encoding algorithm, such a set corresponds to the minimum set of changes that are responsible for the conflict. In our preliminary experimental study on seven PHP applications with a total of 50 test cases and 19 semantic conflicts, Semex correctly detected all 19 conflicts.

Acceptance rate: 25 % (74/291). [ .pdf  , bib  ] Almost every complex software system today is configurable. While configurability has many benefits, it challenges performance prediction, optimization, and debugging. Often, the influences of the individual configurations options on performance is unknown. Worse, configuration options may interact, giving rise to a configuration space of possibly exponential size. Addressing this challenge, we propose an approach that derives a performance-influence model  for a given configurable system, describing all relevant  influences of configuration options and their interactions. Such a model shall be useful for automatic performance prediction and optimization on the one hand, and performance debugging for developers, on the other hand. Our approach combines machine-learning and sampling technique in a novel way. Our approach improves over standard techniques in that it (1) represents influences of options and their interactions explicitly (which eases debugging), (2) smoothly integrates binary and numeric configuration options for the first time, (3) incorporates domain knowledge, if available (which eases learning and increases accuracy), (4) considers complex constraints among options, and (5) systematically reduces the solution space to a tractable size. A series of experiments demonstrates the feasibility of our approach in terms of the accuracy of the models learned as well as the accuracy of the performances predictions one can make with them. Using our approach we were able to identify a number of real performance bugs and other problems in real-world systems.

Acceptance rate: 25 % (74/291). [ .pdf  , bib  ] During software maintenance, program slicing is a useful technique to assist developers in understanding the impact of their changes. While different program-slicing techniques have been proposed for traditional software systems, program slicing for dynamic web applications is challenging since the client-side code is generated  from the server-side code and data entities are referenced across different languages  and are often embedded  in string literals in the server-side program. To address those challenges, we introduce WebSlice, an approach to compute program slices across different languages for web applications. We first identify data-flow dependencies among data entities for PHP code based on symbolic execution. We also compute SQL queries and a conditional DOM that represents client-code variations and construct the data flows for embedded languages: SQL, HTML, and JavaScript. Next, we connect the data flows across different languages and those across PHP pages. Finally, we compute a program slice for any given entity based on the established data flows. Running WebSlice on five real-world PHP systems we found that out of 40,670 program slices, 10 % cross languages 38 % cross files, and 13 % cross string fragments, demonstrating the potential benefit of tool support for cross-language program slicing in web applications.

IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE)  , 41(8):820--841, 2015. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Highly configurable systems allow users to tailor software to specific needs. Valid combinations of configuration options are often restricted by intricate constraints. Describing options and constraints in a variability model allows reasoning about the supported configurations. To automate creating and verifying such models, we need to identify the origin of such constraints. We propose a static analysis approach, based on two rules, to extract configuration constraints from code. We apply it on four highly configurable systems to evaluate the accuracy of our approach and to determine which constraints are recoverable from the code. We find that our approach is highly accurate (93 % and 77 % respectively) and that we can recover 28 % of existing constraints. We complement our approach with a qualitative study to identify constraint sources, triangulating results from our automatic extraction, manual inspections, and interviews with 27 developers. We find that, apart from low-level implementation dependencies, configuration constraints enforce correct runtime behavior, improve users’ configuration experience, and prevent corner cases. While the majority of constraints is extractable from code our results indicate that creating a complete model requires further substantial domain knowledge and testing. Our results aim at supporting researchers and practitioners working on variability model engineering, evolution, and verification techniques.

In Proceedings of the 29th European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming (ECOOP)  , volume 37 of Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics  , pages 495--518, Dagstuhl, Germany: Schloss Dagstuhl--Leibniz-Zentrum fuer Informatik, 2015. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] The C preprocessor has received strong criticism in academia, among others regarding separation of concerns, error proneness, and code obfuscation, but is widely used in practice. Many (mostly academic) alternatives to the preprocessor exist, but have not been adopted in practice. Since developers continue to use the preprocessor despite all criticism and research, we ask how practitioners perceive the C preprocessor. We performed interviews with 40 developers, used grounded theory to analyze the data, and cross-validated the results with data from a survey among 202 developers, repository mining, and results from previous studies. In particular, we investigated four research questions related to why the preprocessor is still widely used in practice, common problems, alternatives, and the impact of undisciplined annotations. Our study shows that developers are aware of the criticism the C preprocessor receives, but use it nonetheless, mainly for portability and variability. They indicate that they regularly face preprocessor-related problems and preprocessor-related bugs. The majority of our interviewees do not see any current C-native technologies that can entirely replace the C preprocessor. However, developers tend to mitigate problems with guidelines, but those guidelines are not enforced consistently. We report the key insights gained from our study and discuss implications for practitioners and researchers on how to better use the C preprocessor to minimize its negative impact.

In Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Release Engineering (Releng)  , pages 20--23, New York, NY: ACM Press, May 2015. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Build systems contain a lot of configuration knowledge about a software system, such as under which conditions specific files are compiled. Extracting such configuration knowledge is important for many tools analyzing highly-configurable systems, but very challenging due to the complex nature of build systems. We design an approach, based on SYMake, that symbolically evaluates Makefiles and extracts configuration knowledge in terms of file presence conditions and conditional parameters. We implement an initial prototype and demonstrate feasibility on small examples.

In Proceedings of the 37th International Conference on Software Engineering (Volume 2) (ICSE)  , pages 693--696, May 2015. Formal Demonstration paper, Best Demonstration Award  . [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] In software development, IDE services such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and “jump to declara- tion” are used to assist developers in programming tasks. In dynamic web applications, however, since the client-side code is dynamically generated from the server-side code and is embedded  in the server-side program as string literals, providing IDE services for such embedded code is challenging. In this work we introduce Varis, a tool that provides editor services on the client-side code of a PHP-based web application, while it is still embedded within server-side code. Technically, we first perform symbolic execution on a PHP program to approximate all possible variations of the generated client-side code and subsequently parse this client code into a VarDOM  that compactly represents all its variations. Finally, using the VarDOM, we implement various types of IDE services for embedded client code including syntax highlighting, code completion, and “jump to declaration”.

Preprocessor-Based Variability in Open-Source and Industrial Software Systems: An Empirical Study  . Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE), Special Issue on Empirical Evidence on Software Product Line Engineering  , 1--34, 2015. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Almost every sufficiently complex software system today is configurable. Conditional compilation  is a simple variability-implementation mechanism that is widely used in open-source projects and industry. Especially, the C preprocessor (cpp) is very popular in practice, but it is also gaining (again) interest in academia. Although there have been several attempts to understand and improve cpp there is a lack of understanding of how it is used in open-source and industrial systems and whether different usage patterns have emerged. The background is that much research on configurable systems and product lines concentrates on open-source systems, simply because they are available for study in the first place. This leads to the potentially problematic situation that it is unclear whether the results obtained from these studies are transferable to industrial systems. We aim at lowering this gap by comparing the use of cpp in open-source projects and industry—especially from the embedded-systems domain—, based on a substantial set of subject systems and well-known variability metrics including size, scattering, and tangling metrics. A key result of our empirical study is that, regarding almost all aspects we studied, the analyzed open-source systems and the considered embedded systems from industry have comparable distributions regarding most metrics, including systems that have been developed in industry and made open source at some point. So, our study indicates that, regarding cpp as variability-implementation mechanism, insights, methods, and tools developed based on studies of open- source systems are transferable to industrial systems—at least, with respect to the metrics we considered.

Acceptance rate: 20 % (55/276). [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Highly-configurable software systems are pervasive, although configuration options and their interactions raise complexity of the program and increase maintenance effort. Especially load-time configuration options, such as parameters from command-line options or configuration files, are used with standard programming constructs such as variables and if statements intermixed with the program’s implementation; manually tracking configuration options from the time they are loaded to the point where they may influence control-flow decisions is tedious and error prone. We design and implement Lotrack, an extended static taint analysis to automatically track configuration options. Lotrack derives a configuration map that explains for each code fragment under which configurations it may be executed. An evaluation on Android applications shows that Lotrack yields high accuracy with reasonable performance. We use Lotrack to empirically characterize how much of the implementation of Android apps depends on the platform’s configuration options or interactions of these options.

In Proceedings of the ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE)  , pages 518--529, New York, NY: ACM Press, November 2014. Acceptance rate: 22 % (61/273). [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] When developing and maintaining a software system, programmers often rely on IDEs to provide editor services such as syntax highlighting, auto-completion and “jump to declaration”. In dynamic web applications, such tool support is currently limited to either the server-side code or to hand-written or generated client-side code. Our goal is to build a call graph for providing editor services on client-side code while it is still embedded  as string literals within server-side code. First, we symbolically execute the server-side code to identify all possible client-side code variations. Subsequently, we parse the generated client-side code with all its variations into a VarDOM  that compactly represents all DOM variations for further analysis. Based on VarDOM, we build conditional call graphs for embedded HTML, CSS, and JS. Our empirical evaluation on real-world web applications show that our analysis achieves 100 % precision in identifying call-graph edges. 62 % of the edges cross PHP strings, and 17 % of them cross files—in both situations, navigation without tool support is tedious and error prone.

In Proceedings of the 13rd SIGPLAN Symposium on New Ideas in Programming and Reflections on Software at SPLASH (Onward!)  , pages 213--226, New York, NY: ACM Press, 2014. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Variation is everywhere, but in the construction and analysis of customizable software it is paramount. In this context, there arises a need for variational data structures for efficiently representing and computing with related variants of an underlying data type. So far, variational data structures have been explored and developed ad hoc. This paper is a first attempt and a call to action for systematic and foundational research in this area. Research on variational data structures will benefit not only customizable software, but the many other application domains that must cope with variability. In this paper, we show how support for variation can be understood as a general and orthogonal property of data types, data structures, and algorithms. We begin a systematic exploration of basic variational data structures, exploring the tradeoffs between different implementations. Finally, we retrospectively analyze the design decisions in our own previous work where we have independently encountered problems requiring variational data structures.

Technical Report CSSE14-01, Auburn, AL: College of Engineering, Auburn University, February 2014. [ .pdf  , bib  ] We performed an empirical study to explore how closely well-known, open source C programs follow the safe C standards for integer behavior, with the goal of understanding how difficult it is to migrate legacy code to these stricter standards. We performed an automated analysis on fifty-two releases of seven C programs (6 million lines of preprocessed C code), as well as releases of Busybox and Linux (nearly one billion lines of partially-preprocessed C code). We found that integer issues, that are allowed by the C standard but not by the safer C standards, are ubiquitous—one out of four integers were inconsistently declared, and one out of eight integers were inconsistently used. Integer issues did not improve over time as the programs evolved. Also, detecting the issues is complicated by a large number of integers whose types vary under different preprocessor configurations. Most of these issues are benign, but the chance of finding fatal errors and exploitable vulnerabilities among these many issues remains significant. A preprocessor-aware, tool-assisted approach may be the most viable way to migrate legacy C code to comply with the standards for secure programming.

ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR)  , 47(1):Article 6, June 2014. [ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] Software-product-line engineering has gained considerable momentum in recent years, both in industry and in academia. A software product line is a set of software products that share a common set of features. Software product lines challenge traditional analysis techniques, such as type checking, model checking and theorem proving, in their quest of ensuring correctness and reliability of software. Simply creating and analyzing all products of a product line is usually not feasible, due to the potentially exponential number of valid feature combinations. Recently, researchers began to develop analysis techniques that take the distinguishing properties of software product lines into account, for example, by checking feature-related code in isolation or by exploiting variability information during analysis. The emerging field of product-line analyses is both broad and diverse, such that it is difficult for researchers and practitioners to understand their similarities and differences. We propose a classification of product-line analyses to enable systematic research and application. Based on our insights with classifying and comparing a corpus of 76 articles, we infer a research agenda to guide future research on product-line analyses.

Understanding Understanding Source Code with Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging  . In Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)  , pages 378--389, June 2014. Acceptance rate: 20 % (99/495). [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Program comprehension is an important cognitive process that inherently eludes direct measurement. Thus, researchers are struggling with providing optimal programming languages, tools, or coding conventions to support developers in their everyday work. With our approach, we explore whether functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)  , which is well established in cognitive neuroscience, is feasible to directly measure program comprehension. To this end, we observed 17 participants inside an fMRI scanner while comprehending short source-code snippets, which we contrasted with locating syntax errors. We found a clear, distinct activation pattern of five brain regions, which are related to working memory, attention, and language processing—all processes that fit well to our understanding of program comprehension. Based on the results, we propose a model of program comprehension. Our results encourage us to use fMRI in future studies to measure program comprehension and, in the long run, answer questions, such as: Can we predict whether someone will be an excellent programmer? How effective are new languages and tools for program understanding? How do we train someone to become an excellent programmer?

In Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)  , pages 907--918, June 2014. Acceptance rate: 20 % (99/495). [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] In plugin-based systems, plugin conflicts may occur when two or more plugins interfere with one another, changing their expected behaviors. It is highly challenging to detect plugin conflicts due to the exponential explosion of the combinations of plugins (i.e., configurations). In this paper, we address the challenge of executing a test case over many configurations. Leveraging the fact that many executions of a test are similar, our variability-aware execution runs common code once. Only when encountering values that are different depending on specific configurations will the execution split to run for each of them. To evaluate the scalability of variability-aware execution on a large real-world setting, we built a prototype PHP interpreter called Varex and ran it on the popular WordPress blogging Web application. The results show that while plugin interactions exist, there is a significant amount of sharing that allows variability-aware execution to scale to 2^50 configurations within seven minutes of running time. During our study, with Varex, we were able to detect two plugin conflicts: one was recently reported on WordPress forum, and another one is not yet discovered.

In Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)  , pages 140--151, June 2014. Acceptance rate: 20 % (99/495). [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Highly-configurable systems allow users to tailor the software to their specific needs. Not all combinations of configuration options are valid though, and constraints arise for technical or non-technical reasons. Explicitly describing these constraints in a variability model allows reasoning about the supported configurations. To automate creating variability models, we need to identify the origin of such configuration constraints. We propose an approach which uses build-time errors and a novel feature-effect heuristic to automatically extract configuration constraints from C code. We conduct an empirical study on four highly-configurable open-source systems with existing variability models having three objectives in mind: evaluate the accuracy of our approach, determine the recoverability of existing variability-model constraints using our analysis, and classify the sources of variability-model constraints. We find that both our extraction heuristics are highly accurate (93 % and 77 % respectively), and that we can recover 19 % of the existing variability-models using our approach. However, we find that many of the remaining constraints require expert knowledge or more expensive analyses. We argue that our approach, tooling, and experimental results support researchers and practitioners working on variability model re-engineering, evolution, and consistency-checking techniques.

In Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)  , pages 989--1000, June 2014. Acceptance rate: 20 % (99/495). [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Hidden code dependencies are responsible for many complications in maintenance tasks. With the introduction of variable features in product lines, dependencies may even cross feature boundaries and related problems are prone to be detected late. Many current implementation techniques for product lines lack proper interfaces, which could make such dependencies explicit. As alternative to changing the implementation approach, we provide a comprehensive tool-based solution to support developers in recognizing and dealing with feature dependencies: emergent interfaces. Emergent interfaces are computed on demand, based on feature-sensitive interprocedural  data-flow analysis. They emerge in the IDE and emulate benefits of modularity not available in the host language. To evaluate the potential of emergent interfaces, we conducted and replicated a controlled experiment, and found, in the studied context, that emergent interfaces can improve performance of code change tasks by up to 3 times while also reducing the number of errors.

Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)  , 19(5):1299--1334, October 2014. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Programming experience is an important confounding parameter in controlled experiments regarding program comprehension. In literature, ways to measure or control programming experience vary. Often, researchers neglect it or do not specify how they controlled for it. We set out to find a well-defined understanding of programming experience and a way to measure it. From published comprehension experiments, we extracted questions that assess programming experience. In a controlled experiment, we compare the answers of computer-science students to these questions with their performance in solving program-comprehension tasks. We found that self estimation seems to be a reliable way to measure programming experience. Furthermore, we applied exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to extract and evaluate a model of programming experience. With our analysis, we initiate a path toward validly and reliably measuring and describing programming experience to better understand and control its influence in program-comprehension experiments.

[ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] The feature-interaction problem has been keeping researchers and practitioners in suspense for years. Although there has been substantial progress in developing approaches for modeling, detecting, managing, and resolving feature interactions, we lack sufficient knowledge on the kind of feature interactions that occur in real-world systems. In this position paper, we set out the goal to explore the nature of feature interactions systematically and comprehensively, classified in terms of order and visibility. Understanding this nature will have significant implications on research in this area, for example, on the efficiency of interaction-detection or performance-prediction techniques. A set of preliminary results as well as a discussion of possible experimental setups and corresponding challenges give us confidence that this endeavor is within reach but requires a collaborative effort of the community.

IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE)  , 40(1):67--82, 2014. [ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] Software product line engineering is an efficient means to generate a set of tailored software products from a common implementation. However, adopting a product-line approach poses a major challenge and significant risks, since typically legacy code must be migrated toward a product line. Our aim is to lower the adoption barrier by providing semiautomatic tool support—called variability mining  —to support developers in locating, documenting, and extracting implementations of product-line features from legacy code. Variability mining combines prior work on concern location, reverse engineering, and variability-aware type systems, but is tailored specifically for the use in product lines. Our work pursues three technical goals: (1) we provide a consistency indicator  based on a variability-aware type system, (2) we mine features at a fine level of granularity  , and (3) we exploit domain knowledge  about the relationship between features when available. With a quantitative study, we demonstrate that variability mining can efficiently support developers in locating features.

Acceptance rate: 20 % (51/251). [ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] The advent of proper variability management and generator technology enables users to derive individual variants from a variable code base solely based on a selection of desired configuration options. This approach gives rise to a huge configuration space but the high degree of variability comes at a cost: classic analysis methods do not scale any more; there are simply too many potential variants to analyze. To address this issue, researchers and practitioners usually apply sampling techniques—only a subset of all possible variants is analyzed. While sampling promises to reduce the analysis effort significantly, the information obtained is necessarily incomplete. Furthermore, it is unknown whether sampling strategies scale to billions of variants, because even samples may be huge and expensive to compute. Recently, researchers have begun to develop variability-aware analyses that analyze the variable code base directly with the goal to exploit the similarities among individual variants to reduce analysis effort. However, while being promising, so far, variability-aware analyses have been applied mostly only to small academic systems. To learn about the mutual strengths and weaknesses of variability-aware and sampling-based analyses of large-scale, real-world software systems, we compared the two by means of two concrete analysis implementations (type checking and liveness analysis) applied to three subject systems: the Busybox tool suite, the x86 Linux kernel, and the cryptographic library OpenSSL. A key result is that in these settings already setting up sampling techniques is challenging while variability-aware analysis even outperforms most sampling approximations with respect to analysis time.

Berlin/Heidelberg: Springer-Verlag, 2013. 308 pages, ISBN 978-3-642-37520-0. [ http  , bib  ] While standardization has empowered the software industry to substantially scale software development and to provide affordable software to a broad market, it often does not address smaller market segments, nor the needs and wishes of individual customers. Software product lines reconcile mass production and standardization with mass customization in software engineering. Ideally, based on a set of reusable parts, a software manufacturer can generate a software product based on the requirements of its customer. The concept of features is central to achieving this level of automation, because features bridge the gap between the requirements the customer has and the functionality a product provides. Thus features are a central concept in all phases of product-line development. The authors take a developer’s viewpoint, focus on the development, maintenance, and implementation of product-line variability, and especially concentrate on automated product derivation based on a user’s feature selection. The book consists of three parts. Part I provides a general introduction to feature-oriented software product lines, describing the product-line approach and introducing the product-line development process with its two elements of domain and application engineering. The pivotal Part II covers a wide variety of implementation techniques including design patterns, frameworks, components, feature-oriented programming, and aspect-oriented programming, as well as tool-based approaches including preprocessors, build systems, version-control systems, and virtual separation of concerns. Finally, Part III is devoted to advanced topics related to feature-oriented product lines like refactoring, feature interaction, and analysis tools specific to product lines. In addition, an Appendix lists various helpful tools for software product-line development, along with a description of how they relate to the topics covered in this book. To tie the book together, the authors use two running examples that are well documented in the product-line literature: data management for embedded systems, and variations of graph data structures. They start every chapter by explicitly stating the respective learning goals and finish it with a set of exercises; additional teaching material is also available online. All these features make the book ideally suited for teaching – both for academic classes and for professionals interested in self-study.

Computer Networks (COMNET), Special Issue on Feature Interaction  , 57(12):2399--2409, August 2013. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Formal specification and verification techniques have been used successfully to detect feature interactions. We investigate whether feature-based specifications can be used for this task. Feature-based specifications are a special class of specifications that aim at modularity in open-world, feature-oriented systems. The question we address is whether modularity of specifications impairs the ability to detect feature interactions, which cut across feature boundaries. In an exploratory study on 10 feature-oriented systems, we found that the majority of feature interactions could be detected based on feature-based specifications, but some specifications have not been modularized properly and require undesirable workarounds to modularization. Based on the study, we discuss the merits and limitations of feature-based specifications, as well as open issues and perspectives. A goal that underlies our work is to raise awareness of the importance and challenges of feature-based specification.

[ .pdf  , http  , bib  ] Program comprehension plays a crucial role during the software-development life cycle: Maintenance programmers spend most of their time with comprehending source code, and maintenance is the main cost factor in software development. Thus, if we can improve program comprehension, we can save considerable amount of time and cost. To improve program comprehension, we have to measure it first. However, program comprehension is a complex, internal cognitive process that we cannot observe directly. Typically, we need to conduct controlled experiments to soundly measure program comprehension. However, empirical research is applied only reluctantly in software engineering. To close this gap, we set out to support researchers in planning and conducting experiments regarding program comprehension. We report our experience with experiments that we conducted and present the resulting framework to support researchers in planning and conducting experiments. Additionally, we discuss the role of teaching for the empirical researchers of tomorrow.

[ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] The collections API of a programming language forms an embedded domain-specific language to express queries and operations on collections. Unfortunately, the ordinary style of implementing such APIs does not allow automatic domain-specific analyses and optimizations such as fusion of collection traversals, usage of indexing, or reordering of filters. Performance-critical code using collections must instead be hand-optimized, leading to non-modular, brittle, and redundant code. We propose SQuOpt, the Scala Query Optimizer—a deep embedding  of the Scala collections API that allows such analyses and optimizations to be defined and executed within Scala, with- out relying on external tools or compiler extensions. SQuOpt provides the same “look and feel” (syntax and static typing guar- antees) as the standard collections API. We evaluate SQuOpt by re-implementing several code analyses of the Findbugs tool using SQuOpt and demonstrate that SQuOpt can reconcile modularity and efficiency in real-world applications.

[ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Software product-line engineering aims at the development of families of related products that share common assets. An important aspect is that customers are often interested not only in particular functionalities (i.e., features), but also in non-functional quality attributes such as performance reliability, and footprint. A naive approach is to measure quality attributes of every single product, and to deliver the products that fit the customers' needs. However, as product lines may consist of millions of products, this approach does not scale. In this research-in-progress report, we propose a systematic approach for the efficient and scalable prediction of quality attributes of products that consists of two steps. First, we generate predictors for certain categories of quality attributes (e.g., a predictor for low performance) based on software and network measures, and receiver operating characteristic analysis. Second, we use these predictors to guide a sampling process that takes the asset base of a product line as input and efficiently determines the products that fall into the category denoted by a given predictor (e.g., products with low performance). In other words, we use predictors to make the process of finding “acceptable” products more efficient. We discuss and compare several strategies to incorporate predictors in the sampling process.

As it is often infeasible to analyze each product of a product line individually, researchers have developed analyses, called variability-aware analyses, that consider and exploit variability manifested in a code base. Variability-aware analyses are often significantly more efficient than traditional analyses, but each of them has certain weaknesses regarding applicability or scalability, as we discuss in this paper. We present the Product-Line-Analysis Model, a formal model for the classification and comparison of existing analyses, including traditional and variability-aware analyses, and lay a foundation for formulating and exploring further, combined analyses. As a proof of concept, we discuss different examples of analyses in the light of our model, and demonstrate its benefits for systematic comparison and exploration of product-line analyses.

[ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] We investigate how to execute a unit test in all configurations of a product line without generating each product in isolation in a brute-force fashion. Learning from variability-aware analyses, we (a) design and implement a variability-aware interpreter and (b) reencode variability of the product line to simulate the test cases with a model checker. The interpreter internally reasons about variability, executing paths not affected by variability only once for the whole product line. The model checker achieves similar results by reusing powerful off-the-shelf analyses. We experimented with a prototype implementation for each strategy. We compare both strategies and discuss trade-offs and future directions.

We validate our experiment with a pilot study, which already preliminarily confirms that students use different strategies to complete maintenance tasks.

[ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] The theory of context-free languages is well-understood and context-free parsers can be used as off-the-shelf tools in practice. In particular, to use a context-free parser framework, a user does not need to understand its internals but can specify a language declaratively as a grammar. However, many languages in practice are not context-free. One particularly important class of such languages is layout-sensitive languages, in which the structure of code depends on indentation and whitespace. For example, Python, Haskell, F\#, and Markdown use indentation instead of curly braces to determine the block structure of code. Their parsers (and lexers) are not declaratively specified but hand-tuned to account for layout-sensitivity. To support declarative  specifications of layout-sensitive languages, we propose a parsing framework in which a user can annotate layout in a grammar as constraints on the relative positioning of tokens in the parsed subtrees. For example, a user can declare that a block consists of statements that all start on the same column. We have integrated layout constraints into SDF and implemented a layout-sensitive generalized parser as an extension of generalized LR parsing. We evaluate the correctness and performance of our parser by parsing 33290 open-source Haskell files. Layout-sensitive generalized parsing is easy to use, and its performance overhead compared to layout-insensitive parsing is small enough for most practical applications.

Scalable Prediction of Non-functional Properties in Software Product Lines: Footprint and Memory Consumption  . Information and Software Technology (IST), Special Issue on Software Reuse and Product Lines  , 55(3):491--507, March 2013. [ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] Context: A software product line is a family of related software products typically created from a set of common assets. Users select features to derive a product that fulfills their needs. Users often expect a product to have specific non-functional properties, such as a small footprint or a bounded response time. Because a product line may have an exponential number of products with respect to its features, it is usually not feasible to generate and measure non-functional properties for each possible product. Objective: Our overall goal is to derive optimal products with respect to non-functional requirements by showing customers which features must be selected. Method: We propose an approach to predict a product’s non-functional properties based on the product’s feature selection. We aggregate the influence of each selected feature on a non-functional property to predict a product’s properties. We generate and measure a small set of products and by comparing measurements, we approximate each feature’s influence on the non-functional property in question. As a research method, we conducted controlled experiments and evaluated prediction accuracy for the non-functional properties footprint and main-memory consumption. But in principle, our approach is applicable for all quantifiable non-functional properties. Results: With nine software product lines, we demonstrate that our approach predicts the footprint with an average accuracy of 94\,\%, and an accuracy of over 99\,\% on average if feature interactions are known. In a further series of experiments, we predicted main memory consumption of six customizable programs and achieved an accuracy of 89\,\% on average. Conclusion: Our experiments suggest that, with only few measurements it is possible to accurately predict non-functional properties of products of a product line. Furthermore, we show how already little domain knowledge can improve predictions and discuss trade-offs between accuracy and required number of measurements. With this technique, we provide a basis for many reasoning and product-derivation approaches.

[ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] FeatureIDE is an open-source framework for feature-oriented software development (FOSD) based on Eclipse. FOSD is a paradigm for the construction, customization, and synthesis of software systems. Code artifacts are mapped to features, and a customized software system can be generated given a selection of features. The set of software systems that can be generated is called a software product line (SPL). FeatureIDE supports several FOSD implementation techniques such as feature-oriented programming, aspect-oriented programming, delta-oriented programming, and preprocessors. All phases of FOSD are supported in FeatureIDE, namely domain analysis, requirements analysis, domain implementation, and software generation.

Technical Report FIN-2012-04, Magdeburg, Germany: University of Magdeburg, April 2012. [ .pdf  , bib  ] Software-product-line engineering has gained considerable momentum in recent years, both in industry and in academia. A software product line is a set of software products that share a common set of features. Software product lines challenge traditional analysis techniques, such as type checking, testing, and formal verification, in their quest of ensuring correctness and reliability of software. Simply creating and analyzing all products of a product line is usually not feasible due to the potentially exponential number of valid feature combinations. Recently, researchers began to develop analysis techniques that take the distinguishing properties of software product lines into account, for example, by checking feature-related code in isolation or by exploiting variability information during analysis. The emerging field of product-line analysis techniques is both broad and diverse such that it is difficult for researchers and practitioners to understand their similarities and differences (e.g., with regard to variability awareness or scalability), which hinders systematic research and application. We classify the corpus of existing and ongoing work in this field, we compare techniques based on our classification, and we infer a research agenda. A short-term benefit of our endeavor is that our classification can guide research in product-line analysis and, to this end, make it more systematic and efficient. A long-term goal is to empower developers to choose the right analysis technique for their needs out of a pool of techniques with different strengths and weaknesses.

Do Background Colors Improve Program Comprehension in the #ifdef Hell?  Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)  , 18(4):699--745, 2012. [ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] Software-product-line engineering aims at the development of variable and reusable software systems. In practice, software product lines are often implemented with preprocessors. Preprocessor directives are easy to use and many mature tools are available for practitioners. However, preprocessor directives have been heavily criticized in academia and even referred to as “#ifdef hell”, because they introduce threats to program comprehension and correctness. There are many voices that suggest to use other implementation techniques instead, but these voices ignore the fact that a transition from preprocessors to other languages and tools is tedious, erroneous, and expensive in practice. Instead, we and others propose to increase the readability of preprocessor directives by using background colors to highlight source code annotated with ifdef directives. In three controlled experiments with over 70 subjects in total, we evaluate whether and how background colors improve program comprehension in preprocessor-based implementations. Our results demonstrate that background colors have the potential to improve program comprehension, independently of size and programming language of the underlying product. Additionally, we found that subjects generally favor background colors. We integrate these and other findings in a tool called FeatureCommander which facilitates program comprehension in practice and which can serve as a basis for further research.

Supporting Program Comprehension in Large Preprocessor-Based Software Product Lines  . IET Software  , 6(6):488--501, December 2012. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Background: Software product line engineering provides an effective mechanism to implement variable software. However, the usage of preprocessors to realize variability, which is typical in industry, is heavily criticized, because it often leads to obfuscated code. Using background colours to highlight preprocessor statements to support comprehensibility has shown effective, however, scalability to large software product lines (SPLs) is questionable. Aim: Our goal is to implement and evaluate scalable usage of background colours for industrial-sized SPLs. Method: We designed and implemented scalable concepts in a tool called FeatureCommander. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conducted a controlled experiment with a large real-world SPL with over 99,000 lines of code and 340 features. We used a within-subjects design with treatments colours and no colours. We compared correctness and response time of tasks for both treatments. Results: For certain kinds of tasks, background colours improve program comprehension. Furthermore, subjects generally favour background colours compared to no background colours. Additionally, subjects who worked with background colours had to use the search functions less frequently. Conclusion: We show that background colours can improve program comprehension in large SPLs. Based on these encouraging results, we will continue our work on improving program comprehension in large SPLs.

Most Influencial Paper Award at ICPC'22  . [ .pdf  , bib  ] Programming experience is an important confounding parameter in controlled experiments regarding program comprehension. In literature, ways to measure or control programming experience vary. Often, researchers neglect it or do not specify how they controlled it. We set out to find a well-defined understanding of programming experience and a way to measure it. From published comprehension experiments, we extracted questions that assess programming experience. In a controlled experiment we compare the answers of 128 students to these questions with their performance in solving program-comprehension tasks. We found that self estimation seems to be a reliable way to measure programming experience. Furthermore, we applied exploratory factor analysis to extract a model of programming experience. With our analysis, we initiate a path toward measuring programming experience with a valid and reliable tool so that we can control its influence on program comprehension.

[ .pdf  , bib  ] Customizable programs and program families provide user-selectable features to tailor a program to an application scenario. Knowing in advance which feature selection yields the best performance is difficult because a direct measurement of all possible feature combinations is infeasible. Our work aims at predicting program performance based on selected features. The challenge is predicting performance accurately when features interact. An interaction occurs when a feature combination has an unexpected influence on performance. We present a method that automatically detects performance feature interactions to improve prediction accuracy. To this end, we propose three heuristics to reduce the number of measurements required to detect interactions. Our evaluation consists of six real-world case studies from varying domains (e.g. databases, compression libraries, and web server) using different configuration techniques (e.g., configuration files and preprocessor flags). Results show, on average, a prediction accuracy of 95 %.

IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE)  , 39(1):63--79, 2013. [ .pdf  , http  , bib  ] Superimposition is a composition technique that has been applied successfully in many areas of software development. Although superimposition is a general-purpose concept, it has been (re)invented and implemented individually for various kinds of software artifacts. We unify languages and tools that rely on superimposition by using the language-independent model of feature structure trees  (FSTs). On the basis of the FST model, we propose a general approach to the composition of software artifacts written in different languages. Furthermore, we offer a supporting framework and tool chain, called FeatureHouse. We use attribute grammars to automate the integration of additional languages. In particular, we have integrated Java, C#, C, Haskell, Alloy, and JavaCC. A substantial number of case studies demonstrate the practicality and scalability of our approach and reveal insights into the properties that a language must have in order to be ready for superimposition. We discuss perspectives of our approach and demonstrate how we extended FeatureHouse with support for XML languages (in particular, XHTML, XMI/UML, and Ant) and alternative composition approaches (in particular, aspect weaving). Rounding off our previous work, we provide here a holistic view of the FeatureHouse approach based on rich experience with numerous languages and case studies and reflections on several years of research.

Software: Practice and Experience (SPE)  , 43(2):153--185, February 2013. [ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] Software is changed frequently during its life cycle. New requirements come and bugs must be fixed. To update an application it usually must be stopped, patched, and restarted. This causes time periods of unavailability which is always a problem for highly available applications. Even for the development of complex applications restarts to test new program parts can be time consuming and annoying. Thus, we aim at dynamic software updates to update programs at runtime. There is a large body of research on dynamic software updates, but so far, existing approaches have shortcomings either in terms of flexibility or performance. In addition, some of them depend on specific runtime environments and dictate the program’s architecture. We present JavAdaptor, the first runtime update approach based on Java that (a) offers flexible dynamic software updates, (b) is platform independent, (c) introduces only minimal performance overhead, and (d) does not dictate the program architecture. JavAdaptor combines schema changing class replacements by class renaming and caller updates with Java HotSwap using containers and proxies. It runs on top of all major standard Java virtual machines. We evaluate our approach’s applicability and performance in non-trivial case studies and compare it to existing dynamic software update approaches.

Technical Report 01/2011, Marburg, Germany: Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Philipps University Marburg, September 2011. [ .pdf  , http  , bib  ] Software product line engineering is an efficient means to generate a set of tailored software products from a common implementation. However, adopting a product-line approach poses a major challenge and significant risks, since typically legacy code must be migrated toward a product line. Our aim is to lower the adoption barrier by providing semiautomatic tool support—called variability mining  —to support developers in locating, documenting, and extracting implementations of product-line features from legacy code. Variability mining combines prior work on concern location, reverse engineering, and variability-aware type systems, but is tailored specifically for the use in product lines. Our work extends prior work in three important aspects: (1) we provide a consistency indicator  based on a variability-aware type system, (2) we mine features at a fine level of granularity  , and (3) we exploit domain knowledge  about the relationship between features when available. With a quantitative study, we demonstrate that variability mining can efficiently support developers in locating features.

[ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Large software projects consist of code written in a multitude of different (possibly domain-specific) languages, which are often deeply interspersed even in single files. While many proposals exist on how to integrate languages semantically and syntactically, the question of how to support this scenario in integrated development environments (IDEs) remains open: How can standard IDE services, such as syntax highlighting, outlining, or reference resolving, be provided in an extensible and compositional way, such that an open mix of languages is supported in a single file? Based on our library-based syntactic extension language for Java, SugarJ, we propose to make IDEs extensible by organizing editor services in editor libraries. Editor libraries are libraries written in the object language SugarJ, and hence activated and composed through regular import statements on a file-by-file basis. We have implemented an IDE for editor libraries on top of SugarJ and the Eclipse-based Spoofax language workbench. We have validated editor libraries by evolving this IDE into a fully-fledged and schema-aware XML editor as well as an extensible Latex editor, which we used for writing this paper.

In Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Feature-Oriented Software Development (FOSD)  , pages 5:1--5:8, New York, NY: ACM Press, September 2011. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Modularity of feature representations has been a long standing goal of feature-oriented software development. While some researchers regard feature modules and corresponding composition mechanisms as a modular solution, other researchers have challenged the notion of feature modularity and pointed out that most feature-oriented implementation mechanisms lack proper interfaces and support neither modular type checking nor separate compilation. We step back and reflect on the feature-modularity discussion. We distinguish two notions of modularity, cohesion  without interfaces and information hiding  with interfaces, and point out the different expectations that, we believe, are the root of many heated discussions. We discuss whether feature interfaces should be desired and weigh their potential benefits and costs, specifically regarding crosscutting, granularity, feature interactions, and the distinction between closed-world and open-world reasoning. Because existing evidence for and against feature modularity and feature interfaces is shaky and inconclusive, more research is needed, for which we outline possible directions.

Acceptance rate: 37 % (61/166). [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] In many projects, lexical preprocessors are used to manage different variants of the project (using conditional compilation) and to define compile-time code transformations (using macros). Unfortunately, while being a simply way to implement variability, conditional compilation and lexical macros hinder automatic analysis, even though such analysis would be urgently needed to combat variability-induced complexity. To analyze code with its variability, we need to parse it without preprocessing it. However, current parsing solutions use heuristics, support only a subset of the language, or suffer from exponential explosion. As part of the TypeChef project, we contribute a novel variability-aware parser that can parse unpreprocessed code without heuristics in practicable time. Beyond the obvious task of detecting syntax errors our parser paves the road for further analysis, such as variability-aware type checking. We implement variabilityaware parsers for Java and GNU C and demonstrate practicability by parsing the product line MobileMedia and the entire X86 architecture of the Linux kernel with 6065 variable features.

[ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Existing approaches to extend a programming language with syntactic sugar often leave a bitter taste, because they cannot be used with the same ease as the main extension mechanism of the programming language—libraries. Sugar libraries are a novel approach for syntactically extending a programming language within the language. A sugar library is like an ordinary library, but can, in addition, export syntactic sugar for using the library. Sugar libraries maintain the composability and scoping properties of ordinary libraries and are hence particularly well-suited for embedding a multitude of domain-specific languages into a host language. They also inherit the self-applicability of libraries, which means that the syntax extension mechanism can be applied in the definition of sugar libraries themselves. To demonstrate the expressiveness and applicability of sugar libraries, we have developed SugarJ, a language on top of Java, SDF and Stratego that supports syntactic extensibility. SugarJ employs a novel incremental parsing mechanism that allows changing the syntax within a source file. We demonstrate SugarJ by five language extensions, including embeddings of XML and closures in Java, all available as sugar libraries. We illustrate the utility of self-applicability by embedding XML Schema, a metalanguage to define XML languages.

Acceptance rate: 17 % (34/203). [ .pdf  , bib  ] An ongoing problem in revision control systems is how to resolve conflicts in a merge of independently developed revisions. Unstructured revision control systems are purely text-based and solve conflicts based on textual similarity. Structured revision control systems are tailored to specific languages and use language-specific knowledge for conflict resolution. We propose semistructured revision control systems that inherit the strengths of both classes of systems: generality and expressiveness. The idea is to provide structural information of the underlying software artifacts—declaratively in the form of annotated grammars. This way, a wide variety of languages can be supported and the information provided can assist the automatic resolution of two classes of conflicts: ordering conflicts and semantic conflicts. The former can be resolved independently of the language and the latter can be resolved using specific conflict handlers supplied by the user. We have been developing a tool that supports semistructured merge and conducted an empirical study on 24 software projects developed in Java, C#, and Python comprising 180 merge scenarios. We found that semistructured merge reduces the number of conflicts in 60 % of the sample merge scenarios by on average, 34 %. Our study reveals that renaming is challenging in that it can significantly increase the number of conflicts during semistructured merge, which we discuss.

SPL Conqueror: Toward Optimization of Non-functional Properties in Software Product Lines  . Software Quality Journal (SQJ), Special Issue on Quality Engineering for Software Product Lines  , 20(3):487--517, 2011. [ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] A software product line (SPL) is a family of related programs of a domain. The programs of an SPL are distinguished in terms of features, which are end-uservisible characteristics of programs. Based on a selection of features, stakeholders can derive tailor-made programs that satisfy functional requirements. Besides functional requirements different application scenarios raise the need for optimizing non-functional properties of a variant. The diversity of application scenarios leads to heterogeneous optimization goals with respect to non-functional properties (e.g., performance vs. footprint vs. energy optimized variants). Hence, an SPL has to satisfy different and sometimes contradicting requirements regarding non-functional properties. Usually, the actually required non-functional properties are not known before product derivation and can vary for each application scenario and customer. Allowing stakeholders to derive optimized variants requires to measure non-functional properties after the SPL is developed. Unfortunately, the high variability provided by SPLs complicates measurement and optimization of non-functional properties due to a large variant space. With SPL Conqueror, we provide a holistic approach to optimize non-functional properties in SPL engineering. We show how non-functional properties can be qualitatively specified and quantitatively measured in the context of SPLs. Furthermore, we discuss the variant-derivation process in SPL Conqueror that reduces the effort of computing an optimal variant. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by means of nine case studies of a broad range of application domains (e.g., database management and operating systems). Moreover, we show that SPL Conqueror is implementation and language independent by using SPLs that are implemented with different mechanisms such as conditional compilation and feature-oriented programming.

Acceptance rate: 31 % (33/105). [ .pdf  , bib  ] Software measures are often used to assess program comprehension, although their applicability is discussed controversially. Often, their application is based on plausibility arguments, which however is not sufficient to decide whether and how software measures are good predictors for program comprehension. Our goal is to evaluate whether and how software measures and program comprehension correlate. To this end, we carefully designed an experiment. We used four different measures that are often used to judge the quality of source code: complexity, lines of code, concern attributes, and concern operations. We measured how subjects understood two comparable software systems that differ in their implementation, such that one implementation promised considerable benefits in terms of better software measures. We did not observe a difference in program comprehension of our subjects as the software measures suggested it. To explore how software measures and program comprehension could correlate, we used several variants of computing the software measures. This brought them closer to our observed result, however, not as close as to confirm a relationship between software measures and program comprehension. Having failed to establish a relationship, we present our findings as an open issue to the community and initiate a discussion on the role of software measures as comprehensibility predictors.

[ .pdf  , bib  ] A software product line is a set of program variants, typically generated from a common code base. Feature models describe variability in product lines by documenting features and their valid combinations. In product-line engineering, we need to reason about variability and program variants for many different tasks. For example, given a feature model, we might want to determine the number of all valid feature combinations or detect specific feature combinations for testing. However, we found that contemporary reasoning approaches can only reason about feature combinations, not about program variants, because they do not take abstract features into account. Abstract features are features used to structure a feature model that, however, do not have any impact at implementation level. Using existing feature-model reasoning mechanisms for product variants leads to incorrect results. We raise awareness of the problem of abstract features for different kinds of analyses on feature models. We argue that, in order to reason about program variants, abstract features should be made explicit in feature models. We present a technique based on propositional formulas to reason about program variants. In practice, our technique can save effort that is caused by considering the same program variant multiple times, for example, in product-line testing.

Best Paper Award  . [ .pdf  , bib  ] A software product line (SPL) is a family of related software products, from which users can derive a product that fulfills their needs. Often, users expect a product to have specific non-functional properties, for example, to not exceed a footprint limit or to respond in a given time frame. Unfortunately, it is usually not feasible to generate and measure non-functional properties for each possible product of an SPL in isolation, because an SPL can contain millions of products. Hence, we propose an approach to estimate  each product's non-functional properties in advance, based on the product's configuration. To this end, we approximate non-functional properties per features  and per feature interaction. We generate and measure a small set of products and approximated non-functional properties by comparing the measurements. Our approach is implementation independent and language independent. We present three different approaches with different trade-offs regarding accuracy and required number of measurements. With nine case studies, we demonstrate that our approach can predict non-functional properties with an accuracy of 2\%.

Acceptance rate: 40 % (20/50). [ .pdf  , bib  ] Background: Software product line engineering provides an effective mechanism to implement variable software. However, the usage of preprocessors, which is typical in industry is heavily criticized, because it often leads to obfuscated code. Using background colors to support comprehensibility has shown effective, however, scalability to large software product lines (SPLs) is questionable. Aim: Our goal is to implement and evaluate scalable usage of background colors for industrial-sized SPLs. Method: We designed and implemented scalable concepts in a tool called FeatureCommander. To evaluate its effectiveness we conducted a controlled experiment with a large real-world SPL with over 160,000 lines of code and 340 features. We used a within-subjects design with treatments colors and no colors. We compared correctness and response time of tasks for both treatments. Results: For certain kinds of tasks, background colors improve program comprehension. Furthermore, subjects generally favor background colors. Conclusion: We show that background colors can improve program comprehension in large SPLs. Based on these encouraging results, we will continue our work improving program comprehension in large SPLs.

ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)  , 21(3):Article 14, 2012. [ .pdf  , doi  , epub  , bib  ] Software-product-line engineering is an efficient means to generate a family of program variants for a domain from a single code base. However, because of the potentially high number of possible program variants, it is difficult to test them all and ensure properties like type safety for the entire product line. We present a product-line–aware type system that can type check an entire software product line without generating each variant in isolation. Specifically, we extend the Featherweight Java calculus with feature annotations for product-line development and prove formally that all program variants generated from a well-typed product line are well-typed. Furthermore, we present a solution to the problem of typing mutually exclusive features. We discuss how results from our formalization helped implementing our own product-line tool CIDE for full Java and report of experience with detecting type errors in four existing software-product-line implementations.

[ .pdf  , acm  , bib  ] The C preprocessor cpp is a widely used tool for implementing variable software. It enables programmers to express variable code of features that may crosscut the entire implementation with conditional compilation. The C preprocessor relies on simple text processing and is independent of the host language (C, C++, Java, and so on). Language independent text processing is powerful and expressive|programmers can make all kinds of annotations in the form of #ifdefs but can render unpreprocessed code difficult to process automatically by tools, such as code aspect refactoring, concern management, and also static analysis and variability-aware type checking. We distinguish between disciplined annotations which align with the underlying source-code structure and undisciplined annotations, which do not align with the structure and hence complicate tool development. This distinction raises the question of how frequently programmers use undisciplined annotations and whether it is feasible to change them to disciplined annotations to simplify tool development and to enable programmers to use a wide variety of tools in the first place. By means of an analysis of 40 mediumsized to large-sized C programs, we show empirically that programmers use cpp mostly in a disciplined way: about 85 % of all annotations respect the underlying source-code structure. Furthermore, we analyze the remaining undisciplined annotations, identify patterns, and discuss how to transform them into a disciplined form.

[ .pdf  , acm  , bib  ] The C preprocessor is commonly used to implement variability. Given a feature selection, code fragments can be excluded from compilation with #ifdef and similar directives. However, the token-based nature of the C preprocessor makes variability implementation difficult and errorprone. Additionally, variability mechanisms are intertwined with macro definitions, macro expansion, and file inclusion. To determine whether a code fragment is compiled, the entire file must be preprocessed. We present a partial preprocessor that preprocesses file inclusion and macro expansion, but retains variability information for further analysis. We describe the mechanisms of the partial preprocessor, provide a full implementation, and present some initial experimental results. The partial preprocessor is part of a larger endeavor in the TypeChef project to check variability implementations (syntactic correctness, type correctness) in C projects such as the Linux kernel.

[ .pdf  , acm  , bib  ] Software product lines have gained momentum as an approach to generate many variants of a program, each tailored to a specific use case, from a common code base. However, the implementation of product lines raises new challenges, as potentially millions of program variants are developed in parallel. In prior work, we and others have developed product-line–aware type systems to detect type errors in a product line, without generating all variants. With TypeChef  , we build a similar type checker for product lines written in C that implements variability with #ifdef  directives of the C preprocessor. However, a product-line–aware type system for C is more difficult than expected due to several peculiarities of the preprocessor, including lexical macros and unrestricted use of #ifdef  directives. In this paper, we describe the problems faced and our progress to solve them with TypeChef  . Although TypeChef  is still under development and cannot yet process arbitrary C code, we demonstrate its capabilities so far with a case study: By type checking the open-source web server Boa  with potentially 2^110 variants we found type errors in several variants.

[ .pdf  , acm  , bib  ] Feature-Oriented Software Development  (FOSD) is a paradigm for the development of software product lines. A challenge in FOSD is to guarantee that all software systems of a software product line are correct. Recent work on type checking product lines can provide a guarantee of type correctness without generating all possible systems. We generalize previous results by abstracting from the specifics of particular programming languages. In a first attempt, we present a reference-checking algorithm that performs key tasks of product-line type checking independently of the target programming language. Experiments with two sample product lines written in Java and C are encouraging and give us confidence that this approach is promising.

Science of Computer Programming (SCP), Special Issue on Feature-Oriented Software Development  , 77(3):174--187, March 2012. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] In feature-oriented programming (FOP) a programmer decomposes a program in terms of features. Ideally, features are implemented modularly so that they can be developed in isolation. Access control is an important ingredient to attain feature modularity as it provides mechanisms to hide and expose internal details of a module's implementation. But developers of contemporary feature-oriented languages have not considered access control mechanisms so far. The absence of a well-defined access control model for FOP breaks encapsulation of feature code and leads to unexpected program behaviors and inadvertent type errors. We raise awareness of this problem, propose three feature-oriented access modifiers, and present a corresponding access modifier model. We offer an implementation of the model on the basis of a fully-fledged feature-oriented compiler. Finally, by analyzing ten feature-oriented programs, we explore the potential of feature-oriented modifiers in FOP.

We propose a novel software design paradigm called feature-oriented design, which takes the distinguishing properties of FOSD into account, especially the clean and consistent mapping between features and their implementations as well as the tendency of features to interact inadvertently. We extend the lightweight modeling language Alloy with support for feature-oriented design and call the extension FeatureAlloy. By means of an implementation and four case studies, we demonstrate how feature-oriented design with FeatureAlloy facilitates separation of concerns, variability, and reuse of models of individual features and helps in defining and detecting semantic dependences and interactions between features.

Acceptance rate: 31 % (18/59). [ .pdf  , acm  , bib  ] Some limitations of object-oriented mechanisms are known to cause code clones (e.g., extension using inheritance). Novel programming paradigms such as feature-oriented programming (FOP) aim at alleviating these limitations. However, it is an open issue whether FOP is really able to avoid code clones or whether it even facilitates (FOP-specific) clones. To address this issue, we conduct an empirical analysis on ten feature-oriented software product lines with respect to code cloning. We found that there is a considerable amount of clones in feature-oriented software product lines and that a large fraction of these clones is FOP-specific (i.e., caused by limitations of feature-oriented mechanisms). Based on our results we initiate a discussion on the reasons for FOP-specific clones and on how to cope with them. We exemplary show how such clones can be removed by the application of refactoring.  

   Christian Kästner  . Virtual Separation of Concerns: Toward Preprocessors 2.0  . PhD thesis, Magdeburg, Germany: University of Magdeburg, May 2010. Logos Verlag Berlin, isbn 978-3-8325-2527-9. [ .pdf  , http  , bib  ] Conditional compilation with preprocessors such as cpp  is a simple but effective means to implement variability. By annotating code fragments with #ifdef  and #endif  directives, different program variants with or without these annotated fragments can be created, which can be used (among others) to implement software product lines. Although, such annotation-based approaches are frequently used in practice, researchers often criticize them for their negative effect on code quality and maintainability. In contrast to modularized implementations such as components or aspects, annotation-based implementations typically neglect separation of concerns, can entirely obfuscate the source code, and are prone to introduce subtle errors. Our goal is to rehabilitate annotation-based approaches by showing how tool support can address these problems. With views, we emulate modularity; with a visual representation of annotations, we reduce source code obfuscation and increase program comprehension; and with disciplined annotations and a product-line–aware type system, we prevent or detect syntax and type errors in the entire software product line. At the same time we emphasize unique benefits of annotations, including simplicity, expressiveness, and being language independent. All in all, we provide tool-based separation of concerns without necessarily dividing source code into physically separated modules; we name this approach virtual separation of concerns  . We argue that with these improvements over contemporary preprocessors, virtual separation of concerns can compete with modularized implementation mechanisms. Despite our focus on annotation-based approaches, we do intend not give a definite answer on how to implement software product lines. Modular implementations and annotation-based implementations both have their advantages; we even present an integration and migration path between them. Our goal is to rehabilitate preprocessors and show that they are not a lost cause as many researchers think. On the contrary, we argue that – with the presented improvements – annotation-based approaches are a serious alternative for product-line implementation.

[ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] Feature-Oriented Software Development (FOSD) provides a multitude of formalisms, methods languages, and tools for building variable, customizable, and extensible software. Along different lines of research, different notions of a feature have been developed. Although these notions have similar goals, no common basis for evaluation, comparison, and integration exists. We present a feature algebra that captures the key ideas of feature orientation and provides a common ground for current and future research in this field, in which also alternative options can be explored. Furthermore, our algebraic framework is meant to serve as a basis for the upcoming development paradigms automatic feature-based program synthesis and architectural metaprogramming.

Automated Software Engineering -- An International Journal (AUSE)  , 17(3):251--300, 2010. [ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] A feature-oriented product line is a family of programs that share a common set of features. A feature implements a stakeholder's requirement and represents a design decision or configuration option. When added to a program, a feature involves the introduction of new structures, such as classes and methods, and the refinement of existing ones, such as extending methods. A feature-oriented decomposition enables a generator to create an executable program by composing feature code solely on the basis of the feature selection of a user – no other information needed. A key challenge of product line engineering is to guarantee that only well-typed programs are generated. As the number of valid feature combinations grows combinatorially with the number of features, it is not feasible to type check all programs individually. The only feasible approach is to have a type system check the entire code base of the feature-oriented product line. We have developed such a type system on the basis of a formal model of a feature-oriented Java-like language. The type system guaranties type safety for feature-oriented product lines. That is, it ensures that every valid program of a well-typed product line is well-typed. Our formal model including type system is sound and complete.

[ .pdf  , acm  , doi  , bib  ] Over 30 years ago, the preprocessor cpp was developed to extend the programming language C by lightweight metaprogramming capabilities. Despite its error-proneness and low abstraction level, the cpp is still widely being used in presentday software projects to implement variable software. However not much is known about how  the cpp is employed to implement variability. To address this issue, we have analyzed forty open-source software projects written in C. Specifically, we answer the following questions: How does program size influence variability? How complex are extensions made via cpp's variability mechanisms? At which level of granularity are extensions applied? What is the general type of extensions? These questions revive earlier discussions on understanding and refactoring of the preprocessor. To answer them, we introduce several metrics measuring the variability complexity, granularity, and type of extensions. Based on the data obtained, we suggest alternative implementation techniques. The data we have collected can influence other research areas, such as language design and tool support.

In Proceedings of the 4th Int'l Workshop on Variability Modelling of Software-Intensive Systems (VaMoS)  , pages 13--20, Essen, Germany: University of Duisburg-Essen, January 2010. [ .pdf  , bib  ] Revision control systems are a major means to manage versions and variants of today's software systems. An ongoing problem in these systems is how to resolve conflicts when merging independently developed revisions. Unstructured revision control systems are purely text-based and solve conflicts based on textual similarity. Structured revision control systems are tailored to specific languages and use language-specific knowledge for conflict resolution. We propose semistructured revision control systems to inherit the strengths of both classes of systems: generality and expressiveness. The idea is to provide structural information of the underlying software artifacts in the form of annotated grammars, which is motivated by recent work on software product lines. This way, a wide variety of languages can be supported and the information provided can assist the resolution of conflicts. We have implemented a preliminary tool and report on our experience with merging Java artifacts. We believe that drawing a connection between revision control systems and product lines has benefits for both fields.

In Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Feature-Oriented Software Development (FOSD)  , pages 27--34, New York, NY: ACM Press, October 2009. [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] In feature-oriented programming (FOP), a programmer decomposes a program in terms of features. Ideally, features are implemented modularly so that they can be developed in isolation. Access control is an important ingredient to attain feature modularity as it provides mechanisms to hide and expose internal details of a module's implementation. But developers of contemporary feature-oriented languages did not consider access control mechanisms so far. The absence of a well-defined access control model for FOP breaks the encapsulation of feature code and leads to unexpected and undefined program behaviors as well as inadvertent type errors as we will demonstrate. The reason for these problems is that common object-oriented modifiers, typically provided by the base language, are not expressive enough for FOP and interact in subtle ways with feature-oriented language mechanisms. We raise awareness of this problem, propose three feature-oriented modifiers for access control, and present an orthogonal access modifier model.

[ .pdf  , http  , bib  ] Conditional compilation with preprocessors like cpp is a simple but effective means to implement variability. By annotating code fragments with #ifdef  and #endif  directives different program variants with or without these fragments can be created, which can be used (among others) to implement software product lines. Although, preprocessors are frequently used in practice, they are often criticized for their negative effect on code quality and maintainability. In contrast to modularized implementations, for example using components or aspects, preprocessors neglect separation of concerns are prone to introduce subtle errors, can entirely obfuscate the source code, and limit reuse. Our aim is to rehabilitate the preprocessor by showing how simple tool support can address these problems and emulate some benefits of modularized implementations. At the same time we emphasize unique benefits of preprocessors, like simplicity and language independence. Although we do not have a definitive answer on how to implement variability, we want highlight opportunities to improve preprocessors and encourage research toward novel preprocessor-based approaches.

Acceptance rate: 31 % (19/62). [ .pdf  , acm  , doi  , bib  ] Physical separation with class refinements and method refinements à la AHEAD and virtual separation using annotations à la #ifdef  or CIDE are two competing groups of implementation approaches for software product lines with complementary advantages. Although both groups have been mainly discussed in isolation, we strive for an integration to leverage the respective advantages. In this paper we provide the basis for such an integration by providing a model that supports both, physical and virtual separation, and by describing refactorings in both directions. We prove the refactorings complete such that every virtually separated product line can be automatically transformed into a physically separated one (replacing annotations by refinements) and vice versa. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we have implemented the refactorings in our tool CIDE and conducted four case studies.

Acceptance rate: 31 % (19/62). [ acm  , doi  , bib  ] Programs can be composed from features. We want to verify automatically that all legal combinations of features can be composed safely without errors. Prior work on this problem assumed that features add code monotonically. We generalize prior work to enable features to both add and remove code, describe our analyses and implementation, and review case studies. We observe that more expressive features can increase the complexity of developed programs rapidly – up to the point where automated concepts as presented in this paper are not a helpful tool but a necessity for verification.

[ .pdf  , bib  ] A software product-line is a family of related programs that are distinguished in terms of features. A feature implements a stakeholders' requirement. Different program variants specified by distinct feature selections are produced from a common code base. The optional feature problem describes a common mismatch between variability intended in the domain and dependencies in the implementation. When this occurs, some variants that are valid in the domain cannot be produced due to implementation issues. There are many different solutions to the optional feature problem, but they all suffer from drawbacks such as reduced variability, increased development effort reduced efficiency, or reduced source code quality. In this paper, we examine the impact of the optional feature problem in two case studies in the domain of embedded database systems, and we survey different state-of-the-art solutions and their trade-offs. Our intension is to raise awareness of the problem, to guide developers in selecting an appropriate solution for their product-line project, and to identify opportunities for future research.

ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)  , 20(1):Article 1; 43 pages, June 2010. [ .pdf  , acm  , doi  , bib  ] Through implicit invocation, procedures are called without explicitly referencing them. Implicit announcement adds to this implicitness by not only keeping implicit which procedures are called, but also where or when – under implicit invocation with implicit announcement, the call site contains no signs of that, or what it calls. Recently, aspect-oriented programming has popularized implicit invocation with implicit announcement as a possibility to separate concerns that lead to interwoven code if conventional programming techniques are used. However, as has been noted elsewhere, as currently implemented it establishes strong implicit dependencies between components, hampering independent software development and evolution. To address this problem, we present a type-based modularization of implicit invocation with implicit announcement that is inspired by how interfaces and exceptions are realized in JAVA. By extending an existing compiler and by rewriting several programs to make use of our proposed language constructs, we found that the imposed declaration clutter tends to be moderate; in particular, we found that for general applications of implicit invocation with implicit announcement fears that programs utilizing our form of modularization become unreasonably verbose are unjustified.

Acceptance rate: 21 % (14/67). [ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] In software product line engineering, feature composition generates software tailored to specific requirements from a common set of artifacts. Superimposition is a popular technique to merge code pieces belonging to different features. The advent of model-driven development raises the question of how to support the variability of software product lines in modeling techniques. We propose to use superimposition as a model composition technique in order to support variability. We analyze the feasibility of superimposition as a model composition technique, offer a corresponding tool for model composition, and discuss our experiences with three case studies (including one industrial study) using this tool.

Crosscutting concerns are concerns that do not align with hierarchical and block decomposition supported by mainstream programming languages. In the past, crosscutting concerns have been studied mainly in the context of object orientation. Feature orientation is a novel programming paradigm that supports the (de)composition of crosscutting concerns in a system with a hierarchical block structure. By means of two case studies we explore the problem of crosscutting concerns in functional programming and propose two solutions based on feature orientation.

Acceptance rate: 28 % (19/67). [ .pdf  , doi  , http  , bib  ] A software product line (SPL) is a family of related program variants in a well-defined domain, generated from a set of features. A fundamental difference from classical application development is that engineers develop not a single program but a whole family with hundreds to millions of variants. This makes it infeasible to separately check every distinct variant for errors. Still engineers want guarantees on the entire SPL. A further challenge is that an SPL may contain artifacts in different languages (code, documentation, models, etc.) that should be checked. In this paper, we present CIDE, an SPL development tool that guarantees syntactic correctness for all variants of an SPL. We show how CIDE's underlying mechanism abstracts from textual representation and we generalize it to arbitrary languages. Furthermore, we automate the generation of safe plug-ins for additional languages from annotated grammars. To demonstrate the language-independent capabilities, we applied CIDE to a series of case studies with artifacts written in Java, C++, C, Haskell, ANTLR, HTML, and XML.

Formal Demonstration paper. [ .pdf  , bib  ] Tools support is crucial for the acceptance of a new programming language. However, providing such tool support is a huge investment that can usually not be provided for a research language. With FeatureIDE, we have built an IDE for AHEAD that integrates all phases of featureoriented software development. To reuse this investment for other tools and languages, we refactored FeatureIDE into an open source framework that encapsulates the common ideas of feature-oriented software development and that can be reused and extended beyond AHEAD. Among others, we implemented extensions for FeatureC++ and FeatureHouse but in general, FeatureIDE is open for everybody to showcase new research results and make them usable to a wide audience of students, researchers, and practitioners.

[ .pdf  , http  , bib  ] The size of the structured query language (SQL) continuously increases. Extensions of SQL for special domains like stream processing or sensor networks come with own extensions, more or less unrelated to the standard. In general, underlying DBMS support only a subset of SQL plus vendor specific extensions. In this paper we analyze application domains where special SQL dialects are needed or are already in use. We show how SQL can be decomposed to create an extensible family of SQL dialects. Concrete dialects, e.g., a dialect for web databases, can be generated from such a family by choosing SQL features à la carte. A family of SQL dialects simplifies analysis of the standard when deriving a concrete dialect, makes it easy to understand parts of the standard, and eases extension for new application domains. It is also the starting point for developing tailor-made data management solutions that support only a subset of SQL. We outline how such customizable DBMS can be developed and what benefits, e.g., improved maintainability and performance, we can expect from this.

[ .pdf  , http  , bib  ] Database schemas are used to describe the logical design of a database. Diverse groups of users have different perspectives on the schema which leads to different local schemas. Research has focused on view integration to generate a global consistent schema out of different local schemas or views. However, this approach seems to be too constrained when the generated global view should be variable and only a certain subset is needed. Variable schemas are needed in software product lines in which products are tailored to the needs of stakeholders. We claim that traditional modeling techniques are not sufficient for expressing a variable database schema. We show that software product line methodologies, when applied to the database schemas overcome existing limitations and allow the generation of tailor-made database schemas.

Wir analysieren und vergleichen beide Ansätze anhand von drei repräsentativen Vertretern und identifizieren anhand von sechs Kriterien individuelle Stärken und Schwächen. Wir stellen fest, dass die jeweiligen Stärken und Schwächen komplementär sind. Aus diesem Grund schlagen wir die Integration des Kompositions- und Annotationsansatzes vor, um so die Vorteile beider zu vereinen, dem Entwickler eine breiteres Spektrum an Implementierungsmechanismen zu Verfügung zu stellen und die Einführung von Produktlinientechnologie in bestehende Softwareprojekte zu erleichtern.

[ .pdf  , bib  ] Features express the variabilities and commonalities among programs in a software product line (SPL). A feature model defines the valid combinations of features, where each combination corresponds to a program in an SPL. SPLs and their feature models evolve over time. We classify the evolution of a feature model via modifications as refactorings specializations, generalizations, or arbitrary edits. We present an algorithm to reason about feature model edits to help designers determine how the program membership of an SPL has changed. Our algorithm takes two feature models as input (before and after edit versions), where the set of features in both models are not necessarily the same and it automatically computes the change classification. Our algorithm is able to give examples of added or deleted products and efficiently classifies edits to even large models that have thousands of features.

[ .pdf  , bib  ] Superimposition is a composition technique that has been applied successfully in many areas of software development. Although superimposition is a general-purpose concept, it has been (re)invented and implemented individually for various kinds of software artifacts. We unify languages and tools that rely on superimposition by using the language-independent model of feature structure trees (FSTs). On the basis of the FST model, we propose a general approach to the composition of software artifacts written in different languages, Furthermore, we offer a supporting framework and tool chain, called FEATUREHOUSE. We use attribute grammars to automate the integration of additional languages, in particular, we have integrated Java C#, C, Haskell, JavaCC, and XML. Several case studies demonstrate the practicality and scalability of our approach and reveal insights into the properties a language must have in order to be ready for superimposition.

[ .pdf  , bib  ] Software product lines can be implemented with many different approaches. However, there are common underlying mechanisms which allow a classification into compositional and annotative approaches. While research focuses mainly on composition approaches like aspect- or feature-oriented programming because those support feature traceability and modularity, in practice annotative approaches like preprocessors are common as they are easier to adopt. In this paper, we compare both groups of approaches and find complementary strengths. We propose an integration of compositional and annotative approaches to combine advantages, increase flexibility for the developer, and ease adoption.

In Proceedings of the GPCE Workshop on Modularization, Composition and Generative Techniques for Product Line Engineering (McGPLE)  , pages 13--18, Passau, Germany: Department of Informatics and Mathematics, University of Passau, October 2008. [ .pdf  , bib  ] Software product line development is a mature technique to implement similar programs tailored to serve the needs of multiple users while providing a high degree of reuse. This approach also scales for larger product lines that use smaller product lines to fulfill special tasks. In such compositions of SPLs, the interacting product lines depend on each other and programs generated from these product lines have to be correctly configured to ensure correct communication between them. Constraints between product lines can be used to allow only valid combinations of generated programs. This, however, is not sufficient if multiple instances of one product line are involved. In this paper we present an approach that uses UML and OO concepts to model compositions of SPLs. The model extends the approach of constraints between SPLs to constraints between instances of SPLs and integrates SPL specialization. Based on this model we apply a feature-oriented approach to simplify the configuration of complete SPL compositions.

[ .pdf  , bib  ] Software product lines (SPLs) enable stakeholders to derive different software products for a domain while providing a high degree of reuse of their code units. Software products are derived in a configuration process by combining different code units. This configuration process becomes complex if SPLs contain hundreds of features. In many cases, a stakeholder is not only interested in functional but also in resulting non-functional properties of a desired product. Because SPLs can be used in different application scenarios alternative implementations of already existing functionality are developed to meet special nonfunctional requirements, like restricted binary size and performance guarantees. To enable these complex configurations we discuss and present techniques to measure nonfunctional properties of software modules and use these values to compute SPL configurations optimized to the users needs.

[ .pdf  , bib  ] Modifying an application usually means to stop the application apply the changes, and start the application again. That means, the application is not available for at least a short time period. This is not acceptable for highly available applications. One reasonable approach which faces the problem of unavailability is to change highly available applications at runtime. To allow extensive runtime adaptation the application must be enabled for unanticipated changes even of already executed program parts. This is due to the fact that it is not predictable what changes become necessary and when they have to be applied. Since Java is commonly used for developing highly available applications we discuss its shortcomings and opportunities regarding unanticipated runtime adaptation. We present an approach based on Java HotSwap and object wrapping which overcomes the identified shortcomings and evaluate it in a case study.

In Proceedings of the 2nd International SPLC Workshop on Visualisation in Software Product Line Engineering (ViSPLE)  , pages 303--313, September 2008. [ .pdf  , bib  ] Implementing software product lines is a challenging task. Depending on the implementation technique the code that realizes a feature is often scattered across multiple code units. This way it becomes difficult to trace features in source code which hinders maintenance and evolution. While previous effort on visualization technologies in software product lines has focused mainly on the feature model we suggest tool support for feature traceability in the code base. With our tool CIDE, we propose an approach based on filters and views on source code in order to visualize and trace features in source code.

[ .pdf  , acm  , doi  , bib  ] Feature-oriented programming (FOP) is a paradigm that incorporates programming language technology, program generation techniques, and stepwise refinement. In their GPCE'07 paper, Thaker et al. suggest the development of a type system for FOP to guarantee safe feature composition, i.e, to guarantee the absence of type errors during feature composition. We present such a type system along with a calculus for a simple feature-oriented Java-like language, called Feature Featherweight Java (FFJ). Furthermore we explore four extensions of FFJ and how they affect type soundness.

Acceptance rate: 29 % (16/55). [ .pdf  , acm  , doi  , bib  ] A functional aspect is an aspect that has the semantics of a transformation; it is a function that maps a program to an advised program. Functional aspects are composed by function composition. In this paper, we explore functional aspects in the context of aspect-oriented refactoring. We show that refactoring legacy applications using functional aspects is just as flexible as traditional aspects in that (a) the order in which aspects are refactored does not matter and (b) the number of potential aspect interactions is decreased. We analyze several aspect-oriented programs of different sizes to support our claims.

[ .pdf  , acm  , doi  , bib  ] Feature modules are the building blocks of programs in software product lines (SPLs). A foundational assumption of feature-based program synthesis is that features are composed in a predefined order. Recent work on virtual separation of concerns reveals a new model of feature interactions that shows that feature modules can be quantized as compositions of smaller modules called derivatives. We present this model and examine some of its unintuitive consequences namely, that (1) a given program can be reconstructed by composing features in any order, and (2) the contents of a feature module (as expressed as a composition of derivatives) is determined automatically by a feature order. We show that different orders allow one to “adjust” the contents of a feature module to isolate and study the impact of interactions that a feature has with other features. Using derivatives, we show the utility of generalizing safe composition (SC), a basic analysis of SPLs that verifies program type-safety, to prove that every legal composition of derivatives (and thus any composition order of features) produces a typesafe program, which is a much stronger SC property.

Acceptance rate: 11 % (30/280). [ .pdf  , doi  , bib  ] A software product line (SPL) is an efficient means to generate a family of program variants for a domain from a single code base. However, because of the potentially high number of possible program variants, it is difficult to test all variants and ensure properties like type-safety for the entire SPL. While first steps to type-check an entire SPL have been taken they are informal and incomplete. In this paper, we extend the Featherweight Java (FJ) calculus with feature annotations to be used for SPLs. By extending FJ's type system, we guarantee that – given a well-typed SPL – all possible program variants are welltyped as well. We show how results from this formalization reflect and help implementing our own language-independent SPL tool CIDE.

However fine-grained extensions, like adding a statement in the middle of a method, either require intricate workarounds or obfuscate the base code with annotations. Though many SPLs can and have been implemented with the coarse granularity of existing approaches fine-grained extensions are essential when extracting features from legacy applications. Furthermore, also some existing SPLs could benefit from fine-grained extensions to reduce code replication or improve readability. In this paper, we analyze the effects of feature granularity in SPLs and present a tool, called Colored IDE (CIDE), that allows features to implement coarse-grained and fine-grained extensions in a concise way. In two case studies, we show how CIDE simplifies SPL development compared to traditional approaches.

Integrated Product Line Model for Semi-Automated Product Derivation Using Non-Functional Properties  . In Proceedings of the 2nd Int'l Workshop on Variability Modelling of Software-Intensive Systems (VaMoS)  , pages 25--23, Essen, Germany: University of Duisburg-Essen, January 2008. [ .pdf  , http  , bib  ] Software product lines (SPL) allow to generate tailormade software by manually configuring reusable core assets. However, SPLs with hundreds of features and millions of possible products require an appropriate support for semi-automated product derivation. This derivation has to be based on non-functional properties that are related to core assets and domain features. Both elements are part of different models connected via complex mappings. We propose a model that integrates features and core assets in order to allow semi-automated product derivation.

In Proceedings of the GPCE Workshop on Aspect-Oriented Product Line Engineering (AOPLE)  , pages 14--19, 2007. [ .pdf  , bib  ] Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) aims at modularizing crosscutting concerns. AspectJ is a popular AOP language extension for Java that includes numerous sophisticated mechanisms for implementing crosscutting concerns modularly in one aspect. The language allows to express complex extensions, but at the same time the complexity of some of those mechanisms hamper the writing of simple and recurring extensions, as they are often needed especially in software product lines. In this paper we propose an AspectJ extension that introduces a simplified syntax for simple and recurring extensions. We show that our syntax proposal improves evolvability and modularity in AspectJ programs by avoiding those mechanisms that may harm evolution and modularity if misused. We show that the syntax is applicable for up to 74\% of all pointcut and advice mechanisms by analysing three AspectJ case studies.

Innovations in Systems and Software Engineering -- A NASA Journal (ISSE)  , 3(3-4):281--289, December 2007. [ .pdf  , http  , bib  ] Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a novel programming paradigm that aims at modularizing complex software. It embraces several mechanisms including (1) pointcuts and advice as well as (2) refinements and collaborations. Though all these mechanisms deal with crosscutting concerns, i.e., a special class of design and implementation problems that challenge traditional programming paradigms, they do so in different ways. In this article we explore their relationship and their impact on software modularity. This helps researchers and practitioners to understand their differences and guides to use the right mechanism for the right problem.

In Proceedings of the SPLC Workshop on Service-Oriented Architectures and Product Lines (SOAPL)  , pages 69--76, Pittsburgh, PA: SEI, September 2007. [ bib  ] Software product line is a paradigm to develop a family of software products with the goal of reuse. In this paper, we focus on a scenario in which different products from different product lines are combined together in a third product line to yield more elaborate products, i.e., a product line consumes products from third product line suppliers. The issue is not how different products can be produced separately but how they can be combined together. We propose a service-oriented architecture where product lines are regarded as services, yielding a service-oriented product line. This paper illustrates the approach with an example for a service-oriented architecture of a web portal product line supplied by portlet product lines.

In Proceedings of the ECOOP Workshop on Refactoring Tools (WRT)  , pages 62--63, Berlin, Germany: TU Berlin, July 2007. [ .pdf  , bib  ] Creating a software product line from a legacy application is a difficult task. We propose a tool that helps automating tedious tasks of refactoring legacy applications into features and frees the developer from the burden of performing laborious routine implementations.

In Proceedings of the 11st International Software Product Line Conference, second volume (Demonstration) (SPLC)  , pages 149--150, 2007. [ .pdf  , bib  ] Taking an extractive approach to decompose a legacy application into features is difficult and laborious with current approaches and tools. We present a prototype of a tooldriven approach that largely hides the complexity of the task.

[ .pdf  , bib  ] Software product lines aim to create highly configurable programs from a set of features. Common belief and recent studies suggest that aspects are well-suited for implementing features. We evaluate the suitability of AspectJ with respect to this task by a case study that refactors the embedded database system Berkeley DB into 38 features. Contrary to our initial expectations, the results were not encouraging. As the number of aspects in a feature grows, there is a noticeable decrease in code readability and maintainability. Most of the unique and powerful features of AspectJ were not needed. We document where AspectJ is unsuitable for implementing features of refactored legacy applications and explain why.  

   Sven Apel  , Christian Kästner  , Thomas Leich  , and Gunter Saake  . Aspect Refinement - Unifying AOP and Stepwise Refinement  . Journal of Object Technology (JOT), Special Issue on TOOLS EUROPE 2007  , 6(9):13--33, October 2007. [ .pdf  , http  , bib  ] Stepwise refinement (SWR) is fundamental to software engineering. As aspectoriented programming (AOP) is gaining momentum in software development, aspects should be considered in the light of SWR. In this paper, we elaborate the notion of aspect refinement that unifies AOP and SWR at the architectural level. To reflect this unification to the programming language level, we present an implementation technique for refining aspects based on mixin composition along with a set of language mechanisms for refining all kinds of structural elements of aspects in a uniform way (methods, pointcuts, advice). To underpin our proposal, we contribute a fully functional compiler on top of AspectJ, present a non-trivial, medium-sized case study, and derive a set of programming guidelines.

In Proceedings of the ICSE Workshop on Assessment of Contemporary Modularization Techniques (ACoM)  , Los Alamitos, CA: IEEE Computer Society, May 2007. [ .pdf  , bib  ] Collaborations are a frequently occurring class of crosscutting concerns. Prior work has argued that collaborations are better implemented using Collaboration Languages (CLs) rather than AspectJ-like Languages (ALs). The main argument is that aspects flatten the objectoriented structure of a collaboration, and introduce more complexity rather than benefits – in other words, CLs and ALs differ with regard to program comprehension. To explore the effects of CL and AL modularization mechanisms on program comprehension, we propose to conduct a series of experiments. We present ideas on how to arrange such experiments that should serve as a starting point and foster a discussion with other researchers.

In Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Reflection, AOP and Meta-Data for Software Evolution (RAM-SE)  , pages 111--122, Magdeburg, Germany: University of Magdeburg, July 2006. [ .pdf  , bib  ] The integration of aspects into the methodology of stepwise software development and evolution is still an open issue. This paper focuses on the global quantification mechanism of nowadays aspect-oriented languages that contradicts basic principles of this methodology. One potential solution to this problem is to bound the potentially global effects of aspects to a set of local development steps. We discuss several alternatives to implement such bounded aspect quantification in AspectJ. Afterwards, we describe a concrete approach that relies on meta-data and pointcut restructuring in order to control the quantification of aspects. Finally, we discuss open issues and further work.

 Past Conferences   
 The ACM international joint conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing ( UbiComp  ) is the result of a merger of the two most renowned conferences in the field: Pervasive and UbiComp. While it retains the name of the latter in recognition of the visionary work of Mark Weiser, its long name reflects the dual history of the new event.   
 The ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computing ( ISWC  ) discusses novel results in all aspects of wearable computing, and has been colocated with UbiComp and Pervasive since 2013.

 Keynote: Computing in the Foundation Model Era   
 Location: Cypress 2  
   
 Abstract   
  Generative AI applications with their ability to produce natural language, computer code and images are transforming all aspects of society. These applications are powered by huge foundation models such as GTP-3 which are trained on massive unlabeled datasets. Foundation models have 10s of billions of parameters and have obtained state-of-the-art quality in natural language processing, vision and speech applications. These models are computationally challenging because they require 100s of petaFLOPS of computing capacity for training and inference. Future foundation models will have even greater capabilities provided by more complex model architectures with longer sequence lengths, irregular data access (sparsity) and irregular control flow. In this talk I will describe how the evolving characteristics of foundation models will impact the design of the optimized computing systems required for training and serving these models. A key element of improving the performance and lowering the cost of deploying future foundation models will be optimizing the data movement within the model using specialized hardware. In contrast to human-in-the-loop applications such as conversational AI, an emerging application of foundation models is in continuous batch processing applications that operate without human supervision. I will describe how continuous batch processing and real-time machine learning can be used to create an intelligent network data plane.

 Keynote: Taking on the World's Challenges: The Role of Computing Research and Innovation   
 Location: Cypress 2  
   
 Abstract   
  Throughout human history, society has faced great opportunities and challenges, and has used its available toolkit to navigate them. Today, many of the global opportunities and challenges we face will require the full engagement of the computing innovation and research community to take on. Resiliently navigating climate trends will require computing techniques and systems to model the future, as well as innovative techniques to mitigate carbon footprint by employing telepresence, optimizing logistics, and more. Another grand challenge of our era is the ability for us as individuals and as groups to communicate with each other in a way that upholds accuracy, integrity, privacy, and trust. The computing research and innovation ecosystem has the power to help. This talk will discuss how the different elements of this ecosystem — academia, industry, professional organizations, and governments — can work together to meet these challenges. It will be a call to action on how we can best navigate the next decade and beyond to do so.

 Title: Reflecting on 50 Years of Computing Research, and Future Outlook   
 Location: Cypress 2  
   
 Abstract   
  The conferences at FCRC represent areas that have laid the foundation for computing. As part of its 50th anniversary celebration, the Computing Research Association (CRA) is organizing this panel to reflect on the contributions of the field by the communities represented by these conferences. The panelists will discuss global computing research and its impact, digging into the evolution of programming languages, computer architecture, parallel and distributed computing, theory, and AI. We will consider how technological advances and external forces -- such as industry and government organizations — shaped this evolution. Given a present where computing is transforming every industry and every facet of daily life, it is a good time to recall the critical steps that brought the field to this point. The panelists will share perspectives on the future by considering what has been learned from computing’s past.

 Keynote: Constructing and Deconstructing Trust: Employing Cryptographic Recipe in the ML Domain   
 Location: Cypress 2  
   
 Abstract   
  For decades now cryptographic tools and models have been developed to transform platforms controlled by worst case adversaries to trustworthy platforms. In this talk I will describe how to use a general cryptographic recipe and specific cryptographic tools to build trust in various phases of the machine learning pipelines or prove that at times it is impossible to achieve. We will touch on achieving verification, robustness and privacy. If time permits, we will show how cryptographic tools can be brought to build trust in the legal domain.
