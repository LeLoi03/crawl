Similar to previous years, ACML 2023 has two publication tracks  . Authors may submit either to: 
Conference Track: | (16-page limit with references) for which the proceedings will be published as a volume of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research Workshop and Conference Proceedings (PMLR).
 Journal Track: | (20-page limit with references) for which accepted papers will appear in a special issue of the Springer Machine Learning Journal (MLJ).
 Please note that submission procedures for the two tracks are different. Please read the instructions carefully before submitting.   
Conference Track 
Submission Deadline: June 30, 2023  June 23, 2023   For the conference track, please submit your manuscript via CMT at: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACML2023  . 
IMPORTANT:   When creating a new submission on CMT, please ensure you choose the "Conference"  track. 
The Latex submission template and style file can be found here: ACML2023_submission_template.zip  . 
 The Latex camera-ready template and style file can be found here: ACML2023_camera-ready_template.zip  . 
Manuscripts must be written in English, be a maximum of 16 pages (including references, appendices, etc.) and follow the PMLR style. If required, supplementary material may be submitted as a separate file, but reviewers are not obliged to consider this. 
All conference track submissions must be anonymized  . Submissions that are not anonymized, over-length, or not in the correct format will be rejected without review. To anonymize, simply leave the author information empty in the Tex template. There is no separate format for anonymizing. 
It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g., in arXiv) as long as it is not cited in the submission. 
Journal Track 
Submission Deadline: June 02, 2023  May 26, 2023   In addition to the conference track, this year’s ACML will run a journal track, similar to previous years. Papers that are accepted to the journal track must be presented at the conference in order to be published. 
IMPORTANT:   Similar to previous years, for the journal track, the abstract and the paper must be submitted to two different systems simultaneously   for the purpose of review management: 
First, please submit ONLY the title and abstract via CMT at: | https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACML2023. | (paper manuscript need not be submitted here). When creating the submission on CMT, please choose the | "Journal" | track.
 Then, please submit the paper via Springer’s Editorial Manager system at: | https://www.editorialmanager.com/mach. | When creating a new submission on Springer’s Editorial Manager, please make sure to choose | "S.I.: ACML 2023" | as the article type.
 For the journal track, manuscripts must be written in English with a maximum of 20 pages (including references, appendices, etc.). For the template and style files, please follow the instructions for authors on the journal website: https://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10994  . 
The journal track will follow the reviewing process of the Machine Learning journal. This includes allowing papers that require minor changes to be resubmitted after a first-round review. The journal track committee will aim to complete the reviewing process in time for this year’s conference. In the unlikely event that the reviewing process for a paper is not completed in time (for this year’s conference), the paper will not be considered for the conference and the review will be completed as a regular submission to the Machine Learning journal. 
The journal track review is single-blind, i.e., the authors’ identity will be visible to reviewers. It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. Submissions that are not in the correct format will be rejected without review. In addition, extended versions of published conference papers are not eligible for journal track submission. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g., in arXiv).
14. ACML_3 conference:

Some of our participants are unfortunately facing visa challenges  that might prevent them from joining us in person at the conference. We understand the immense effort and dedication it takes to contribute to ACM Multimedia 2023, and we want to reassure everyone that even if you cannot attend in person due to unforeseen circumstances, your paper will still be featured in the conference proceedings. Our team is dedicated to ensuring a fulfilling and enriching experience for all participants, whether they attend in person or online. We will do our utmost to accommodate any challenges and ensure a satisfactory conference experience for all. 
In addition, we’d like to inform you that your paper will be presented in a 2-minute teaser session for those attending in person. For those who may not be able to make it in person, we will also have 2-minute teaser sessions in separate offline sessions to ensure your research receives the attention it deserves.  
We hope to see as many of you as possible, and we thank you for your understanding.

Make sure to book your hotel stay at the Westin Hotel,  Ottawa conference hotel. The hotel  is at the center of the conference activity, and will allow you to network easily with other conference attendees. Also, it’s a quick trip to get to the program and functions, and just as quick to nip back to your room for a break. Staying at the conference hotel will provide a better conference experience! 
Everyone enjoys meeting in a comfortable conference venue, offering quality service and support for workshops, tutorials, plenary sessions, and other activities. As the transaction for those services and support, the conference guarantees that a percentage of attendees will stay in the hotel. The contract with the hotel then guarantees a specific number of sleeping rooms will be used each night during the conference. If the conference does not meet the contracted sleeping room commitment, the hotel gets paid anyway. Those unfilled rooms will cost the conference thousands of dollars. 
Please support ACMMM 2023 and SIGMM by staying at the Westin Hotel!

AAAI-23 Main Technical Track 
Call for Papers 
 All authors must complete a reproducibility checklist, which facilitates replication of the reported research.
 All authors are expected to be available to review (light load), unless extenuating circumstances apply.
 NeurIPS-22 Fast Track: rejected papers with *final, average* scores of at least 4.9 may be submitted directly into AAAI-23’s Phase 2 along with, for example, previous reviews and paper ID.
 The purpose of the AAAI conference series is to promote research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and foster scientific exchange between researchers, practitioners, scientists, students, and engineers across the entirety of AI and its affiliated disciplines. AAAI-23 is the Thirty-Seventh AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. The theme of this conference is to create collaborative bridges  within and beyond AI. Like previous AAAI conferences, AAAI-23 will feature technical paper presentations, special tracks, invited speakers, workshops, tutorials, poster sessions, senior member presentations, competitions, and exhibit programs, and two new activities: a Bridge Program and a Lab Program. Many of these activities are tailored to the theme of bridges and all are selected according to the highest standards, with additional programs for students and young researchers. 
Driven by its disciplinary diversity, AAAI has incubated numerous AI sub-disciplines and conferences and has nurtured for decades the cohesion of AI. New communities often emerge when two or more disciplines come together in order to explore new opportunities and perspectives; today both are plentiful. The purpose of this year’s Bridge Program is to tap into new sources of innovation by cultivating sustained collaboration between two or more communities, directed towards a common goal. Our interpretation of bridge  is broad and encompasses disciplines both within and outside of AI. Hence, the communities that our Bridge Program is intended to bring together could be distinct subfields of AI, such as planning and learning, or different disciplines that contribute to and benefit from AI, such as AI and the humanities. 
We plan for AAAI-23 to be an in-person conference and are exploring opportunities to complement this with remote participation. Given the volatile situation, however, the exact format of the conference can only be decided at a later stage.

ADCOM 2023: Adaptive, Generative and Bio-inspired AI in Computing and Communication  
The Advanced Computing and Communications Society  (ACCS) in association with the Digital University Kerala  announces the 28th annual International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications  (ADCOM 2023) at Maker Village, Kochi during 8th – 10th December 2023. 
ADCOM, the flagship Systems Conference of the ACCS, is a major annual international meeting that draws leading scientists and researchers in computational and communications engineering from across industry and academia. ADCOM highlights the growing importance of Large-Scale Systems Engineering and provides the platform to share, discuss and witness leading edge research and trends. 
ADCOM 2023 explores the current state-of-art AI covering a broad spectrum of adaptive, generative and bio-inspired algorithms and/or hardware useful in computing and communications. Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can create new content, such as text, images, or other media, from scratch. Generative AI models are trained on large datasets of existing content, and then use this data to learn the patterns and rules that govern how that content is created. Generative AI has a wide range of potential applications in Content creation, Data augmentation, Artificial intelligence assistant, Entertainment, Product design etc.

Call for papers  
The ACM MobiCom conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions in the field of wireless networking and mobile computing. MobiCom solicits papers that address important research challenges and build practical working systems. Successful papers should propose novel ideas to attack such problems through rigorous analysis, system design and real-world measurement or deployment of mobile networks, systems and applications. 
 
 MobiCom’23 will emphasize novelty and creativity while, at the same time, taking a broader and more inclusive view of wireless and mobile systems research. On one hand, the more novel the concept, the harder it can be to fully develop or evaluate all its aspects. On the other hand the more practical and developed the system, the more simple and sometimes known techniques must be leveraged. The review process will take both cases into account as intellectual merit and novelty can be found in techniques, system designs, implementations, and applications. The review process will also favor papers that describe how the authors will provide access to well-documented datasets, modeling and/or simulation tools, and codebases to support the reproducibility of their methods as well as papers that highlight and discuss not only the significance but also the limitations of the work. 
 
 Unlike in previous years, MobiCom’23 will not have separate categories of challenge, experience, and verification papers. However, we do encourage the submission of experience papers as full papers that provide detailed technical insight into real-world deployments of novel technologies and systems. MobiCom'23 will also incorporate early notifications for papers rejected in round 1 and rebuttals as described below in more detail.

 Two Deadlines, Early Notification, Rebuttals, and One-shot Revision 

 MobiCom 2023 offers authors the option of two deadlines and keeps the one-shot revision process to enhance the timeliness and quality of the scientific results from the research community. Each paper will go through the same rigorous reviewing process as in previous MobiCom conferences. The review process for each deadline will involve two rounds. Papers that are not selected to proceed after the first round will receive an early notification, including reviews. After the second round of reviews, the reviews will be released to the authors and who will have one week to submit a rebuttal. 
 
 Rebuttals 
MobiCom will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to the final consideration of the papers at the program committee meeting. Authors must limit their responses to (a) correcting factual errors in the reviews or (b) directly addressing questions posed by reviewers. Responses should be limited to clarifying the submitted work. In particular, responses must not include new experiments, new data, or new figures, describe additional work completed since submission or promise additional work to follow. 
 
 The submission of a rebuttal is optional. Rebuttals will be limited to a maximum of 1000 words submitted in the online submission form. It is worth noting that available reviews will be released at the above-mentioned times. However, additional reviews might be solicited or submitted after the rebuttal period. 
 
 Final decisions will be one of the following 

 Accept | : Accepted papers will be presented at the MobiCom conference and appear as part of the proceedings and the MobiCom website. Note all the papers in this category will initially be | conditionally accepted | . The papers that go through a successful | anonymous | shepherding process will eventually be accepted.
 Reject | : Rejected after reviewed papers cannot be resubmitted until 11 months have passed since the last MobiCom deadline they were submitted to. We strongly encourage the authors to address reviewers' feedback before re-submitting the paper to MobiCom.
 One-Shot-Revision | : Papers, where a revision is required, will be given specific action points and can be resubmitted for the | next | deadline. For such papers, the reviewers will articulate a maximum of three major changes/clarifications that they would like to see. After the resubmission, the paper will be evaluated based on whether the authors have properly addressed the reviewers’ requests. Unlike in the shepherding process, the requested action points may include running additional experiments that obtain specific results and could take more than 4-6 weeks. During this revision period, the paper is still considered under review to MobiCom and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration.
 
 Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers 
The authors of accepted MobiCom 2023 papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee that will assess how well the submitted artifacts support the work described in the accepted papers. Participation in Artifact Evaluation is voluntary and has no influence on the paper’s acceptance, but is strongly encouraged. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive badges printed on the papers themselves. Additional details on the Artifact Evaluation process can be found here. 
 
 Submission Instructions 

 All paper submissions will be handled electronically at the MobiCom ’23 paper submission website  . Authors should prepare a PDF version of their full paper. All submitted papers will be evaluated through a double-blind  reviewing process, with the identities of the authors withheld from the reviewers. 
 
 Before final submission, you are expected to make sure that your paper complies with the following requirements. Please do not violate these requirements with the aim of including additional material: ​submissions that violate the formatting requirements may not be reviewed​.  You can visually inspect a page-by-page report of your paper format using the same tool as the submission system via a separate ​ online form  . After the submission deadline, we will use the same tool to check the conformance of papers. The format checking tool uses heuristics and can make mistakes. The PC chairs will manually inspect and possibly reject those papers with evident format violations. However, no paper will be rejected due to format violations without being manually checked. 
 
 Any papers that do not adhere to the following guidelines may be immediately rejected:

 IEEE DSAA Conference Guide  
 1. What is IEEE DSAA?   
 IEEE DSAA sponsorship  
 The IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (IEEE DSAA) is finally sponsored by the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society. DSAA is also technically sponsored by ACM through SIGKDD and the American Statistical Association (ASA).  
   
  The IEEE DSAA is coordinated by the IEEE Task Force on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (IEEE TF-DSAA) at tfdsaa.datasciences.org  .  
   
  The IEEE DSAA conference website is at www.dsaa.co  .  
   
  DSAA conference at-a-glance  
 Generally, IEEE DSAA lasts for three to four days with the first day focusing on industry and government data science innovations, showcases, policy debate, and training. In a four-day mode, DSAA has its conference reception in the evening on the first day, conference opening on the second morning and the conference banquet on the third evening.  
   
  The opening session summarizes the conference arrangements, statistics of submissions and acceptance, the main program, and logistics, etc. by the lead general chair and program chair, and the local arrangement chair. The banquet will be hosted by the conference with the award ceremony, steering committee chair’s brief, possible social program, and a brief introduction to the next year's conference.  
   
  Parallel technical sessions will cover paper presentations from the Research track, Application track, Special Sessions, and other tracks if any (such as journal tracks and poster tracks). An Industry/Government Forum or Industry Day may be held on the first day to widely engage industry and government data scientists and policy-makers. Data Science School may be hosted in parallel to the main conference sessions and special sessions on the second-third days as mini-data science courses including lectures and tutorials. DSAA has unique arrangements of a Trends & Controversies session, and an Industry Invited Talk session, in addition to exhibitions and job fair and matching if possible. Conference organizers may add social programs to the budget within the schedule and budget permit.

  General/program chairs nomination  
 DSAA aims to be a flagship conference in data science and analytics thus is rigorous with the profile of core function chairs. This particularly applies to the DSAA general chairs, Research program chairs, and Application program chairs, who are expected to be well recognized in the respective communities, justified by high H-index, citations, previous experience in chairing/hosting top-tier conferences in the relevant areas, in addition to ensuring diversity, equity, integrity and conflict of interest of the organizing committees and conference operations. The lead chairs of a bid proposal are encouraged to discuss with the DSAA Steering Committee about candidates for these core roles before their confirmations. The DSAA Steering Committee decides who is qualified for taking the above core roles and may request an adjustment of or make recommendations to these positions.  
   
  Location and venue selection  
 Generally, IEEE DSAAs are held in major cities in Asia, Europe, and America iteratively. Places with easier access by international travelers and broader data-related businesses and companies are preferred, given the nature of DSAA. IEEE DSAA is generally held in a quality hotel (five stars) convenient to travelers with a variety of accommodation options surrounding the venue to satisfy different needs.  
   
  Sponsors and supporters  
 Besides technical sponsors including IEEE (CIS), ACM (SIGKDD), and ASA, DSAA has received wide support from many major industrial and professional organizations. Conference organizers are encouraged to actively approach sponsors and supporters for financial and broad community engagement purposes. Please refer to the Call for Sponsors  to attract and negotiate sponsorship. Different levels of sponsorship with respective benefits may be specified on the website. Organizers are encouraged to refer to the immediately previous years of sponsorship for consistency and continuity consideration. The logos of confirmed sponsors and supporters should be listed on the IEEE DSAA websites, program booklets, flyers, and conference bags to appreciate their support. Sponsors are acknowledged in DSAA conference opening, banquet, and relevant sponsored activities.  
   
  Refer to DSAA Sponsors  for more information about sponsors and supporters.  
   
  Proposal selection criteria  
 The proposals will be reviewed by the DSAA Steering Committee and/or in the annual Advisory/Steering Committee meeting hosted by the earlier conference in addition to the formal conference proposal evaluation by IEEE conference committees once a host is confirmed. Main selection criteria include the high profile and qualification of general and program chairs, 
  the profile and diversity of all function chairs,

  the unique features and local/regional engagement, and 
  strengths and weaknesses in comparison with other proposals. 
   
  All proposal leaders should arrange travels to attend the corresponding DSAAs and report to the steering committee meeting, with onsite clarification and responses to questions that may be raised by the Committee. The Committee will make their decisions about which bids to host which years of DSAA conferences, and who to be appointed as general chairs and program chairs. If necessary, the Committee holds the right to adjust the core team and appoint core organizers by discussing with the proposal leaders. A successful bid will be announced at the conference banquet, followed by a presentation to be made by the bidding group.  
   
  3. How to operate IEEE DSAA?   
 Committee formation  
 The IEEE DSAA Steering Committee appoints general chairs and program chairs for both Research and Application tracks, who are then responsible for appointing other function chairs. General chairs are responsible for the whole conference operations and success. Program chairs, who report to the general chairs, are responsible for all technical programs including main and special session tracks, data science school/tutorials, and best paper award selection by overseeing and supporting the respective function chairs’ operations.  
   
  Function chairs    
  There may be many function chairs to be collaboratively appointed by general chairs and PC chairs, with the involvement of the Steering Committee chair if necessary. Typical chair roles may include Local Arrangement Chairs, Special Session Chairs, Trends & Controversies Chairs, Industry Invited Talks Chairs, Data Science School Chairs, Tutorial Chairs, Panel Chairs, Best Paper Award Chairs, Next-generation Data Scientists Award Chairs, IEEE Travel Award Chairs, Publication/Proceedings Chairs, Publicity/Media Chairs, Sponsorship Chairs, and Web Chairs.  
   
  DSAA encourages the appointment of function chairs in balanced, diversified, and ethical ways in terms of covering different regions, research areas, and genders while maintaining the candidates' international standing, conference organizing experience, and contributions to the conference.  
   
  General chairs    
  The Steering Committee appoints high-profile international leaders in the DSAA areas as general Chairs. General chairs oversee the whole conference, coordinate a regular (monthly) committee meeting with core function chairs, and make strategic decisions to ensure smooth conference operations, quality and success. General chairs are requested to regularly report to the steering committee chair through monthly meetings. Strategic matters may be discussed with the steering committee chair for approval or support. The general chairs are responsible for the complete financial balance and IEEE conference reporting. Refer to DSAA General Chairs  for more information about general chairs who chaired the past DSAA conferences.  
   
  Program chairs    
  The Steering Committee appoints high-caliber international leaders in the DSAA areas as program chairs of the Research Track and Applications Track. Program chair candidates are expected to have high h-index, past experience in chairing top-tier conferences, and significant recognition by the international communities. DSAA requests senior and active international researchers and professionals to be appointed as program committee members.  
   
  These main track program chairs may discuss to share the workload of managing paper inquiries, submissions, review, and selection. Program chairs are to encourage international participation in the conference, form high-profile senior program committees and regular program committees, and ensure the quality, credibility, diversity, ethics, and integrity of the paper review and selection. None of PC chairs (and track chairs) are allowed to submit papers to the tracks managed by them. PC chairs report to general chairs on a regular basis.  
   
  Refer to DSAA Program Chairs  for more information about program chairs who chaired the past DSAA conferences. Technical program  
 Main tracks    
  In general, IEEE DSAA consists of two main tracks: Research and Application. The Research Track is aimed at collecting original significant contributions that report new ideas, original outcomes, and the latest theoretical foundations and advancement of data science and advanced analytics. The Application Track is aimed at collecting impactful contributions related to successful and reproducible applications, case studies, and best practices of data science and advanced analytics in real-life scenarios. Selected DSAA papers may be invited for extension and selection into journals such as the International Journal of Data Science and Analytics  , Springer.  
   
  A Call for Paper is organized for both tracks, referring to a CFP example  . In the paper submission system (Easychair or Microsoft CMT), Research and Application tracks should be separately established, configured, and managed by respective PC track chairs. Program committees should be formed for each track respectively.  
   
  Special sessions tracks    
    Proposals for organizing special sessions are welcome to encourage research on emerging topics relevant to DSAA. Each special session will be operated as a special track within the conference submission system and program.  
   
  DSAA is developing a special session model that is neither a classic workshop model nor a special session model used in some conferences. DSAA special sessions ensure the quality and integrity of special session papers and their alignment with the main conference in one proceeding (labeled separately per their track names). DSAA does not support separate special session proceedings, special session papers will be included in the same conference proceedings as the main tracks while they should be clearly labeled by their track names.  
   
  The conference's Special Session Chairs coordinate the invitations, acceptances, and operations of all special session proposals. DSAA encourages those existing sessions to be continuously held in the next-year DSAAs to promote and build their corresponding reputation and communities.  
   
  DSAA special session tracks follow the same deadlines as main tracks in submission, review, camera-ready, registration, and IEEE Xplore submissions.  
   
  In the DSAA submission system, PC chairs open special session tracks for respective special sessions. A special session track is managed by the respective special session track chairs as the session organizers, who nominate track PCs to the conference special session chairs for review and confirmation before those qualified PCs are added to the submission system by the track chairs. To maintain the integrity and avoid conflict of interest, special session track chairs are not allowed to submit papers to their own tracks but can submit papers to other tracks.  
   
  DSAA special session papers are reviewed by each session’s program committee, coordinated by the session organizers. Session organizers make recommendations on paper acceptances or rejections, DSAA program chairs or their nominated representatives (i.e., the conference special session chairs) make final decisions by considering the paper quality and the consistency with the main conference. DSAA requests a competitive and consistent acceptance rate for all special sessions. The acceptance rate and acceptance letters are made by the main conference program chairs. We strongly encourage special sessions on statistics/mathematics for data science and data science for industry/government.  
   
  Special sessions on statistics/mathematics for data science 
   To support the cross-disciplinary interactions between statistics/mathematics and broad data science communities, DSAA strategically supports special sessions on statistics/mathematics for data science, which may be organized by statisticians/mathematicians who are interested in data science and in collaborations with broad data science communities especially in computing and informatics. Paper submissions to this special session may be in the form of two-page extended abstracts with full papers to a nominated journal. Invited talks are encouraged.  
   
  Special sessions on data science for industry/government 
   To support the broad/deep engagement of industry/government in data science and the interactions between industry/government and broad data science communities, DSAA strategically supports special sessions on data science for industry/government, which may be organized by industry/government leaders who are interested in data science and in collaborations with broad data science communities especially experienced data science researchers. Submissions to these special sessions may be in the form of two-page extended abstracts with full presentations to the conference if accepted. Invited talks are encouraged.  
   
  Student Poster track    
  Student posters may be considered in a student poster track to showcase state-of-the-art and early-stage research developments by students in data science and analytics disciplines on topics that are of interest to either the research or the application of data science and analytics. The Student Poster paper length is a maximum of two (2) pages and should be formatted in the same way as the main track submissions. The double-blind review will be organized for all student poster submissions. Student poster sessions may be organized in the DSAA conferences with each poster to have a three-minute highlight and its presentation in the conference poster sessions. Accepted DSAA student posters may also be presented in the conference poster sessions. Poster sessions may be in parallel to the respective technical sessions outside the session rooms or at some consolidated places in the conference venue for possible discussions at lunch or reception time. Reception/lunches if provided may be organized in the area of hosting the posters.  
   
  Industry Poster track    
  Industry posters may be considered in an industry poster track to showcase state-of-the-art and early-stage research developments, best practices, or impactful applications of data science for industry, government, and NGO policy-makers and practitioners. An industry poster may share case studies, experience and lessons, and insights and impact without a full-length submission as for the main tracks. The Industry Poster paper length is a maximum of two (2) pages and should be formatted in the same way as the main track submissions. The double-blind review will be organized for all industry poster submissions. Industry poster sessions may be organized in the DSAA conferences with each poster to have a three-minute highlight and its presentation in the conference poster sessions. Accepted DSAA industry posters may also be presented in the conference poster sessions. Poster sessions may be in parallel to the respective technical sessions outside the session rooms or at some consolidated places in the conference venue for possible discussions at lunch or reception time. Reception/lunches if provided may be organized in the area of hosting the posters.  
   
  Keynote speakers    
  Four high profile keynote speakers are usually invited from academia and industry by the conference organizers, with an endorsement from the Steering Committee. The appointment of keynote speakers should consider the speaker's profile, an international reputation, and standing, in addition to the balance and diversity of their gender, regions, and disciplines/areas. Each speaker presents a usually one-hour talk at the plenary session. Keynote speakers are fully sponsored by the conference (including travel, accommodation, registration, and possibly honorarium). Refer to DSAA Keynote Speakers  for more information about keynote speakers who spoke at the past DSAA conferences.  
   
  Trends & Controversies session    
  IEEE DSAAs feature its Data Science Trends & Controversies (T&C) session every year to host visionary talks by invitation only. The T&C session invites visionary leaders to outline different insights and views about today and the future of data science and advanced analytics. Particular topics of interest may include emerging and next-generation research, innovation, challenges and prospects, new research and economic opportunities, products, systems, tools and capability building in relevant domains and research areas, and about policies, standards, social issues, ethics, fairness, security. Specific talks on fostering the next-generation data science profession and education may also be considered.  
   
  Four visionary speakers may be invited from academia and industry to the T&C session by the T&C chairs, in discussions with the general and program chairs. Senior representatives from platinum and gold sponsors may be invited to deliver T&C talks. Each T&C invited talk is given about 30 minutes in the plenary sessions. T&C chairs may discuss with general chairs about possible financial support and local support to T&C speakers, who will receive complimentary registrations by default. Sponsorship may be secured to sponsor T&C speeches.  
   
  Industry/government forum or industry day    
  To support the wide and deep engagement and developments of industry/government data science, DSAA strategically supports an Industry/Government Forum or an industry day on the first conference day. The Forum may be composed of local industry/government showcases, exhibitions, presentations, the Industry Invited Talks session, sponsor’s talks, and presentations accepted by special sessions on data science for industry/government (if any). The Forum may be held as a pre-conference event or a parallel event on the first two days if necessary. Chairs may be appointed to handle local engagement, the Industry Invited Talks session, and special sessions on data science for industry/government, respectively.  
   
  Industry Invited Talks session    
  DSAA features an Industry Invited Talks session to host industry talks by invitation only. This session is about sharing the latest development of advanced data science technologies, systems and tools, projects and practices, and experience and issues. Senior industry/government speakers are invited to share their experience, practice, and vision about topics such as data science innovation, technologies, practice, economy, profession, policy, standardization, vision, and directions.  
   
  Four senior industry/government speakers may be invited by the Industry Invited Talks chairs, in discussions with the general and program chairs. Senior representatives from or recommended by platinum and gold sponsors may be invited to deliver Industry Invited Talks. Each Industry Invited Talk is given about 30 minutes in parallel sessions. Industry Invited Talks chairs may discuss with general chairs about possible financial support and local support to Industry Invited Talks speakers, who will receive complimentary registrations by default. Sponsorship may be secured to support Industry Invited Talks speeches.  
   
  Data science school    
  To leverage the significant market need and gaps in training next-generation data scientists, DSAA strategically supports a Data Science School either as a pre-conference or in parallel to the main conference sessions. DSAA program chairs appoint Data Science School chairs to design and implement a two-day systematic, light, but structured course program, which may consist of introductory lectures and advanced tutorials on data science theories and hands-on practices.  
   
  Tutorials    
  DSAA considers all proposals for introductory lectures and advanced tutorials on any Data Science and Analytics topic. Preferences will be given to invited lectures/tutorials that form a mini and structured data science curriculum, original tutorials that have not yet or recently presented elsewhere. Introductory lectures may target an audience consisting of advanced undergraduate and graduate students, research scientists, as well as attendees from the industry. Topics can be in all areas of data science and analytics, and duration can be either 1/4 (1.5 hours) or 1/2 (3 hours) day. Each accepted lecture/tutorial will receive one free conference registration to DSAA. Presenters will be required to provide comprehensive lecture/tutorial notes (printable slides) well the event opening, which will then be published on the DSAA web site and thus be made available to conference attendees free of charge. Lectures/tutorials may be presented during the main DSAA conference in parallel sessions.  
   
  A tutorial proposal may address the following aspects: The proposed tutorial title 
  The preferred duration (1/4 or 1/2 day) 
  An abstract to introduce the tutorial objectives, topics, scope, and benefits 
  A table of contents in a dot point format with detailed scope and depth of the topics to be covered 
  A brief characterization of the potential target audience for the tutorial, including prerequisite knowledge 
  A very brief biography with detailed contacts of the proposed presenter(s) 
  Background in the tutorial area, including a list of publications/presentations 
  Evidence of teaching experience (courses taught or references) 
  Evidence of scholarship in AI or Computer Science 
  Audio/visual equipment needs for the presentation. 
   
  Submission, review, selection and ethics  
 Submission    
  Conference paper submissions to any main and special session tracks of DSAAs should be limited to a maximum of ten (10) pages in the IEEE 2-column format (see the IEEE Proceedings Author Guidelines: http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html  ). Either LaTeX or Word Template is encouraged to be used for formatting conference and special session papers. To help ensure correct formatting, please use the style files for U.S. Letter Size found at the link above as templates for your submission. These include LaTeX and Word. Violations of any of the above paper specifications may result in the rejection of a submission. Please note that the Latex template does not allow for keywords. If you are using the Latex template, do not include keywords in your paper.  
   
  DSAA takes double-blind review, hence author names and affiliations must not appear in the submissions, and bibliographic references must be adjusted to preserve author anonymity.  
   
  Submissions to a special session should be submitted by choosing the respective special session track when you submit a paper to DSAA. A paper can only be allowed to submit to one track in DSAA, either the main track or a special session track. Duplicated submissions to more than one track will be administratively rejected.  
   
  Review    
  All submissions will be double-blind reviewed by at least three Program Committee members on the basis of technical quality, relevance to conference topics of interest, originality, significance, and clarity. A senior program committee member may coordinate the review and recommendation consolidation before a conclusion is formed by the program chairs.  
   
  DSAA conference special session chairs coordinate with each session track’s chairs in the track program committee formation, review, and paper recommendation to ensure the quality consistency, and fairness of all sessions and with the main conference tracks (by collaborating with PC chairs).  
   
  Organizers of each special session assign the session submissions to their track PCs for review. If no enough PCs are available for a track's paper review, PC chairs can assign the track papers to main track PCs for review. Special session organizers make recommendations on each paper in their track. The conference special session chairs check the recommendations from each session and make final decisions by discussing with the track chairs and conference PC chairs who determine the acceptance rate and final decisions. When a dispute is caused, the conference PC chairs discuss with conference special session chairs and make the final decisions. PC chairs and conference special session chairs ensure the quality and acceptance rate integrity between special sessions and between main tracks and special tracks. PC chairs send the final decisions to authors of special sessions.  
   
  Acceptance    
  Following the successful trial of DSAA'2014 to DSAA'2016, DSAA main conferences are expected to maintain a competitive acceptance rate (overall rate lower than 25% with long presentation rate at about 10%), in which both long presentation (about 10% acceptance rate) and regular presentation papers are suggested. Both long and regular presentation papers follow the same length as at submission. The acceptance rate for special sessions is expected to be consistent with the main conference tracks, while PC chairs and special session chairs may decide the specific rate per the quality of the submissions.  
   
  Plagiarism    
  Plagiarism is unacceptable to DSAA. Quotations should be clearly identified and appropriate citations should be included for the verbatim copy and/or reuse of material from other published papers. Submissions must be original and must not be published or under consideration to be published elsewhere.  
   
  Ethics, diversity, integrity and conflict of interest    
  All DSAA organizers should follow the general act of conduct and research ethics on their roles and responsibilities. Typical rules for ensuring ethics, diversity and integrity and avoiding conflict of interest include: DSAA is highly international and diversified, not only rotating in different countries and regions but also encouraging the diversity and equity of function chair roles and keynote/invited speakers (including covering major disciplines such as mathematics, statistics, informatics and computing and balancing genders, career opportunities and domains). 
  In general, general chairs, PC chairs and local arrangement chairs should not come from same organizations. 
  PC chairs are not allowed to submit papers to any tracks. 
  Special session track chairs are not allowed to submit papers to their own tracks but can submit their papers to other tracks. 
  Award chairs should not accept the invitation if they plan to submit the papers to the conference or there may be potential conflict of interest. 
  Program committee members should not share the submission information with each other and with authors. 
  Conference organizers cannot present keynote speeches, T&C talks, or Invited industry Talks. 
  Tutorial chairs cannot submit tutorial proposals. 
   
  Conference proceedings  
 The conference proceeding (or publication) chairs manage the editing of conference proceedings that include all accepted papers in both main tracks and special session tracks in terms of IEEE specifications and requirements. DSAA holds one proceeding for all accepted papers and posters of main tracks, special session tracks, and poster tracks. Accepted special session submissions will be included in the Special Session part of the main conference proceedings. All papers will be published by IEEE and included in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library, EX-indexed. Papers for each track should be separately listed under their respective track names in the proceeding. The proceeding will be decomposed of several parts corresponding to the respective tracks.  
   
  To include DSAA proceedings into IEEE Xplore, publication chairs need to follow IEEE instructions to edit the proceedings by using IEEE provided tools and specifications. The edited proceedings confirmed by IEEE can be copied to USB for conference circulation. IEEE may request the final submission of proceedings to IEEE immediately after the conference for inclusion into the IEEE Xplore Digital Library.  
   
  IEEE DSAA awards  
 DSAA sets up the following awards to acknowledge the significant contributions in key selected areas.  
  DSAA Service Award 
  to award key DSAA organizers who have made significant contributions to the DSAA conference success in each year. Best Research Paper Award 
  to award one best paper selected from all accepted papers in the Research Track. Best Application Paper Award 
  to award one best paper selected from all accepted papers in the Application Track. Next-generation Data Scientist (NGDS) Awards 
  to award distinguished early-career researchers in data science, typically within five years after awarded a Ph.D. qualification.  
  Refer to DSAA Awards  for more information about DSAA awards.  
   
  DSAA Service Award    
  The DSAA Steering Committee selects one representative from each year's DSAA organizing committee to give the DSAA Service Award. This award acknowledges the significant contributions made by the representative to the critical success of the conference. The DSAA Steering Committee will consult the candidate selection with general chairs, PC chairs, and local arrangement chairs. The awardee will be presented a golden-colored plaque at A4 plate on a wooden mount and receive continuous five-year complimentary registrations in the coming five years.  
   
  Best Paper Awards    
  DSAA recommends two best paper awards only: Best Research Paper Award and Best Application Paper Award for the most representative papers selected from Research and Application track respectively. There are no runner-up awards and no student paper awards selected in DSAA. The Best Research Paper Award and Best Application Paper Award will each receive USD$500 from the conference (or its sponsors) plus a golden-colored plaque at A4 plate on a wooden mount.  
   
  An award committee is usually formed by the Best Paper Award chairs who are usually not PC chairs and have no conflict of interest. In the award ceremony, a one-sentence summary is given by the award chair to each award to summarize the most influential contribution made in the paper that makes it unique and qualified for the award. A 20-minute highlight presentation of each awarded paper may be organized in some parallel sessions.  
   
  Next-Generation Data Scientists Award    
  Since 2016, DSAA Steering Committee has launched the Next Generation Data Scientist (NGDS) Award to address the significant gap between the increasing data scientist job requirements and the limited availability of qualified data scientists. The purpose of offering this NGDS award is to encourage young talents to conduct foundational research and applied innovation in Data Science and set a role model for next-generation data scientists. More details are in the Call for NGDS Awards  .  
   
  The NGDS Award is the only one in the world that supports the production of qualified data scientists. Every year, DSAA may offer a limited number of NGDS Awards to full-time early-career researchers who have just got doctorate degrees within five years to the application. DSAA Steering Committee wants the NGDS Awards to be highly prestigious and selective, hence the criteria for NGDS candidate selection are rigorous. If there is no candidate who satisfies the selection criteria in a year, there will be no NGDS award given.  
   
  The NGDS awards may be sponsored by some of the DSAA sponsors. Each NGDS awardee will receive a USD1,000 honorarium. Although the NGDS award is not limited to people who are DSAA authors, all full-time early-career researchers with the acceptance of long-presentation papers at DSAAs are encouraged to apply. Awardees must attend the conference as a condition to receive the awards. A 20-minute highlight presentation by the NGDS awardee may be organized in some plenary or parallel sessions.  
   
  IEEE Student and Researcher Travel Award    
  IEEE CIS sponsors several IEEE CIS Student and Researcher Travel Awards every year to students and professionals who are presenting one or more papers at the DSAA conference. The travel awardees much hold the membership of IEEE and membership of IEEE Computational Intelligence Society. DSAA Travel Award chairs need to work with the coordinator of IEEE CIS Student and Researcher Travel Awards nominated by the IEEE CIS about the selection criteria, awardee selection, and offers.  
   
  Local arrangement matters  
 Conference venue and parallel sessions    
  The conference venue should fit the size and relevant activity requirements of the conference including catering for parallel sessions for main, special, and poster sessions, the Industry/Government Forum (if any), the Data Science School (if any), and other extra activities if planned. At least three-to-five parallel sessions may be reserved for three continuous main conference days while pre-conference events (e.g., Industry/Government Forum, Data Science School) may be held on an extra (first) day and on other venues if necessary. The venue should have a large conference room to host the plenary sessions.  
   
  Conference booklet, program and bags    
  A professional-looking DSAA conference brochure should be designed and printed for circulation to participants of DSAA each year. The booklet usually consists of the following sections: DSAA’20XX Agenda of a Glance, DSAA’20XX Chairs’ Welcome Message, Program Highlights (summary of keynote speeches, Research, and Application tracks, Special Sessions, Trends &Controversies Panel, Industry/Government Forum, Industry Invited Talks, Data Science School, Tutorials, and other features, etc.), DSAA’20XX Industry/Government Forum Program, DSAA’20XX Data Science School Program, DSAA’20XX Conference Program (detailed agenda of each conference day), DSAA’20XX Conference Organization (all committees), DSAA’20XX Sponsors and Supporters (tiers, logos, and names), Conference Venue and WiFi (floorplan, wifi password), Introduction to next year DSAA, and Useful Links and Emergency Contacts, etc.  
   
  The conference program should be updated to the conference website well before the conference opening. Accepted papers and tentative program may be uploaded to the conference website shortly after paper acceptance for the convenience of participants to prepare their travel and visa applications.  
   
  Conference bags are ordered and customized for each year of DSAAs. In addition to the conference booklet, the conference bags may hold other materials such as sponsors’ flyers and call for papers for the next year of DSAA. Materials to be placed into conference bags must receive permission from general chairs. Sponsor logos may be printed on the conference bags.  
   
  Exhibitions    
  Exhibitions may be organized to fulfill DSAA sponsorship requirements for sponsors to demonstrate their technologies and/or solutions, explore recruitment opportunities, and meet with current/future employees and clients. Exhibition booths may be assigned per sponsorship levels. Discussions with local organizers are suggested to arrange the exhibitions.  
   
  Invitation letters, travel support and participation certificate    
  Some participants may request invitation letters from DSAA local organizers for visa and travel applications while others may require a certificate of participation. Local organizers should clearly list the contact persons and the supporting documents requested from participants on the website and instantly issue the invitation letters.  
   
  Timetable display and adjustment notice board    
  Many hotels have TVs or screens that can be used to display DSAA daily program, timetable, adjustment, and notice. Adjustment of session rooms, paper presentation timeslots, cancellations, notices, etc. should be advertised to all participants through onsite notice board, onsite display screens, and social media, etc.  
   
  Roadmap and sign    
  Sometimes, it is not obvious for participants to find the session rooms and social program venues. A clear roadmap and signs should be arranged and placed at the critical points for guiding the traffic and transport. Instructions to the conference venue, hotels, and floorplan of the conference venue should be prepared and uploaded to the conference website and program booklet.  
   
  Computers, audio-video facilities and session time-keeping    
  The conference organizers should prepare one computer for each session for paper/speech presentations. Audio-video facilities should be arranged for presenters who may request such facilities. Time-keeping may be arranged to remind speakers to keep presentations on time.  
   
  Video-recording and photographing    
  Video-recording and photographing should be arranged by local organizers to record those important moments and activities in the conference, in particular, opening, keynote speeches, T&C talks, industry invited talks, tutorials, banquet, and group photos.  
   
  Session chairs and no-shows    
  Session chairs must be appointed by the PC chairs with their presence on time confirmed prior to the conference opening. Session chairs may be requested to be onsite 10 minutes before sessions start, collect all slides and presentations to a computer provided by the conference, and check whether all presenters are ready. Session chairs should also check and ensure the computer and projector provided are in good condition before sessions start. Chairs are responsible to maintain the schedule accurately and inform speakers of the time durations allocated to their talks and remaining time for discussions (usually 2 minutes or so). Please take note of "NO SHOW" presentations and inform the registration desk after your session, and contact volunteers, the registration desk, or PC chairs if there is an urgent matter. Please complete the “Session Report Sheet” from PC chairs and return it to the registration desk after the session to report issues and the status of the session. This sheet is highly important to check “NO SHOW” presentations and to ensure the quality and success of IEEE DSAAs.  
   
  Every paper needs to be orally presented by one of the authors or a nominated attendee. For session chairs, if the presenter of a paper is absent (“no-show”), please continue to the next presentation. Please check again at the end of the last presentation whether the “no-show” shows up. No show papers should be withdrawn before proceedings are finalized, or the authors MUST inform the PC chairs immediately if none of them can attend the conference due to unforeseen circumstances, otherwise, the conference should inform the authors' organizations of their absence.  
   
  Conference reception    
  The conference reception is usually organized in the evening of the first conference day, for example, from 6.30 pm to 8.30 pm. Refreshments and drinks are usually provided. Welcome speech may be delivered by local organizers and sponsors if any.  
   
  Conference opening ceremony    
  The conference opening ceremony is usually held in the morning of the first main conference day (or the second day if the first day is committed to industry events), for example, from 8.30 am to 9.00 am, right before the first keynote speech session. General chairs host the opening ceremony with a welcome from DSAA Steering Committee chair, brief statistics of submissions, review, and acceptance by PC chairs, a brief introduction to conference technical and social program, and logistics information by local arrangement chairs.  
   
  Conference banquet and award ceremony    
  The conference banquet is usually organized in the evening of the second main conference day. Gala dinner is usually provided. In addition to a brief summary of conference statistics and history, award ceremony, steering committee chair’s brief, introduction to the future DSAA conferences, entertaining performance is often arranged. Some organizers may prefer to have the award ceremony separated from the banquet rather organized in the first session of a conference day, for example, 8.30 am – 9.00 am.  
   
  Conference closing ceremony    
  The conference closing ceremony is organized right after the last session of the conference. General chairs host the closing ceremony, draw the conclusion and make appreciation, representatives from the next-year DSAA local organizers present a brief welcome. Refreshments and drinks may be offered.  
   
  Registration and financials  
 Every accepted paper MUST make at least one FULL regular registration (not student registrations) before the paper registration deadline given by the conference and MUST submit the camera-ready version before the camera-ready deadline to guarantee all papers to be included in the conference proceedings. Depending on the expenses at the conference city, DSAA suggests a full regular registration fee of approximately USD $600 (early bird) and a full student registration rate at about USD $400 (early bird) for a full-time student who can provide formal evidence of enrolment from the academic department. Full registration covers main tracks, tutorials, special sessions, and conference social programs. When Industry/Government Forum and Data Science School are organized, additional registrations may be separately required by package registration rates for everything or single rates for Forum or School to cover the relevant costs. When budget is permitted, local organizers may consider providing lunches and catering services including teas, reception, and banquet free of charge.  
   
  Job fair and matching  
 An item should be added to the conference website to introduce the DSAA job fair and matching program. DSAA hosts a website ( data science career center  ) for job seekers (graduates and professionals looking for jobs, students for internships) to meet with employers (representatives from companies and academia) and for job matching to match job seekers with employers before and during DSAA. Interested job seekers and employers should register for the job fair. DSAA will match-make the employers with seekers by providing job seekers' information to relevant employers.  
   
  Website  
 Once a conference bid success is confirmed, a website should be established as soon as possible before the conference kickoff. The website should be informative to cover aspects including key dates, calls for submissions, special sessions, tutorials, sponsorship, travel and NGDS awards, introduction to the conference venue and visa and travel arrangements, the organizing committee including Advisory and Steering committee with photos of all function chairs presented, guide and web links to submissions and camera-ready, accepted talks, papers and tutorials, and conference technical and social program. Contacts for general and specific inquiries should be provided.  
   
  A newsroom and social media channels should be set up on the front page of the website. Local organizers may refer to www.dsaa.co  and previous DSAA conference websites for relevant information.  
   
  DSAA social media accounts  
 DSAA has set up social media accounts, they are as follows:  
   
  Facebook: | www.facebook.com/ieeedsaa 
  LinkedIn: | https://www.linkedin.com/grp/home?gid=8393182 
  Twitter: | https://twitter.com/ieeedsaa 
  Google+: | https://groups.google.com/d/forum/ieeedsaa 
   
  These social media accounts should be placed on the top of the DSAA conference website's homepage.  
   
  You may consider adding the live update of Twitter and Facebook and a newsroom to the homepage of your conference website for live communications with an audience of interest. Local organizers, in particular local arrangement chairs, webmaster, social media chair, or publicity chairs, may use DSAA social media channels to instantly update the conference progress, key highlights, and notice to the communities.  
   
  Conference transfer meeting  
 A conference transfer meeting may be called and chaired by the steering committee chair in the current conference to transfer the experience from the current organizers to the next-year organizers. The meeting gathers all function chairs for the current conference and the next-year conference to share knowledge and experience and discuss questions and suggestions that may ensure the smooth operations of the next-year conference and the quality integrity between DSAA conferences. This is an important strategy for conference success, all function chairs should by all means attend this meeting.  
   
  4. How is IEEE DSAA governed?   
  
  DSAA is governed by the DSAA International Steering Committee, with advice from the Advisory Committee. The Steering Committee consists of recognized senior international researchers and practitioners distributed in representative countries and regions, representing different research areas and communities relevant to DSAA. Committee members take a voluntary job to give back to the community by driving the data science field, community, and capability building through DSAA.  
   
  Conference governance structure  
 The annual DSAA conference follows a governance structure as follows: a decision-making committee should be formed which usually consists of general chairs, PC chairs, local arrangement chairs, and the steering committee chair; 
  a monthly meeting should be organized by the lead general chair with the key function chairs to report the progress, issues and plan etc.;<\li> 
  Research and Application track PC chairs report to General Chairs who oversee the whole conference decision-making and operations; 
  technical function chairs such as tutorial and conference special session chairs are appointed by and report to Research PC chairs; 
  non-technical function chairs are appointed by and report to general chairs. 
   
  Annual steering committee meeting  
 An annual Advisory/Steering Committee meeting is hosted by the conference, usually after the conference reception in the first evening. The conference organizers should prepare a meeting room with dinner and presentation facilities. Guests from the current, previous, and future conferences will be invited by the Committee chair.  
   
  The meeting consists of two parts: an open session and a closed session. In the open session, the Committee chair opens and welcomes participants to the meeting, followed by a report from previous conferences including financial reports, an update on the current conference, presentations for future conferences, and general discussions. In the closes session, the Committee reviews the reports, addresses issues identified, makes strategic discussions and planning, and makes decisions regarding future conferences and membership. The Committee will discuss whether new members should be appointed into the Advisory/Steering Committees.  
   
  Conference reporting to steering committee  
 The next-year DSAA conference is kicked off when the current conference closes. The DSAA conference general chairs, local arrangement chairs, and other relevant chairs have regular progress and review teleconference meetings with the steering committee chair bi-monthly or monthly per need. The meeting may discuss strategies and initiatives suggested by the steering committee.  
   
  Advisory committee  
 The Advisory Committee is to provide high level and strategic guide and future directions to the Steering Committee and conference organizers, to ensure DSAA to reach its strategic goal as a flagship in the data science and analytics domain and the long-term goal of substantially promoting the building of data science and analytics field, community, capabilities and best practice. The Advisory Committee members are not required to attend the annual conference.  
   
  Please add the members of the current Advisory Committee  to your conference website.  
   
  Steering committee  
 The Steering Committee takes the leadership of ensuring the quality, impact, credibility, and integrity of DSAA conferences. The Committee appoints general chairs and program chairs for each year of conferences, selects host organizations, and provides oversight and guidance to the operations of the conferences. The Committee takes strategic efforts to enlarge the impact and engagement of DSAA internationally towards an inter-disciplinary, cross-domain, and cross-academia and business direction. The Committee takes strategic decisions to support and build emerging, disadvantaged and under-represented areas and regions.  
   
  Given the important responsibilities taken by the Committee especially in the annual Committee meeting hosted by the current conference, members are required to attend the annual conference. Existing membership may be adjusted based on the actual engagement and contributions to DSAA through the annual Committee meeting, with new members invited who contribute significantly to DSAA.  
   
  Please add the members of the current Steering Committee  to your conference website.

  What is eScience?  
 We offer two definitions, one long and one short: eScience studies, enacts, and improves the ongoing process of innovation in computationally-intensive or data-intensive research methods; typically this is carried out collaboratively, often using distributed infrastructure. eScience encompasses all fields of research and addresses all stages of the research lifecycle, from formulation of the research questions, through large scale simulations and data analytics, scientific discovery, up to long-term sharing, reusing, and reapplying of the results, data as well as the relevant tools, processes and knowledge. 
  eScience promotes innovation in collaborative, computationally- or data-intensive research across all disciplines, throughout the research lifecycle.

   eScience Steering Committee Charter  
 eScience Steering Committee Charter (as amended 27 Nov 2019)   
 I. Purpose of the International Conference on eScience (herein known as the eScience Conference)   
 The objective of the eScience Conference is to promote and encourage all aspects of eScience and its associated technologies, applications, and tools.   
 The conference is managed by a standing Steering Committee, a standing Advisory Committee, and for each conference, an Organizing Committee and a Program Committee.  
 II. Sponsorship   
 The Sponsor shall have the right to withdraw from participation in eScience. The Sponsor will provide notice of withdrawal as soon as possible prior to the next eScience, but no later than the publishing of the Call For Papers. Withdrawal shall be effective upon receipt by the Sponsor(s) of written notice of withdrawal. Upon the effective date of withdrawal, all references to the Sponsor shall be deleted from all promotional, advertising and other materials produced for the purpose of distribution in connection with eScience. The withdrawing Sponsor will be liable for its proportionate share of any expenses, losses, and contractual obligations incurred up to the effective date of withdrawal unless a new sponsor agrees to assume all liability for expenses, losses and contractual obligations. The name of the conference belongs to the Sponsor unless released to a new sponsor for continuation.  
 III. The Steering Committee   
 A. Purpose   
 To oversee the long-term planning and success of this conference. The Steering Committee plans for future conferences, evaluates how well each conference has achieved the objectives stated above, and implements improvements to better meet these objectives.  
 The Steering Committee is responsible for the general oversight of and setting policy for the Conference. The Steering Committee is normally responsible for making the major strategic decisions, namely, the appointment of the general chair(s) and program chair(s), selection of dates and locations, major theme, and communication with the sponsor. In addition, the Steering Committee may review and approve the budget before it is sent to the sponsor.  
 More specifically the Steering Committee should  
 Plan future eScience Conferences, 
  Obtain feedback about the eScience Conference for the purpose of improving the conference, 
  Select the General and Program Chairs of future eScience Conferences in response to the submitted proposals, 
  Select the sites and dates for future eScience Conferences, in response to the submitted proposals, 
  Assist in the appointment of other positions in the Program Committee. 
  Monitor the progress of future eScience Conferences, and act if needed to prevent problems that would seriously affect the reputation of the conference. 
  B. Steering Committee Chairperson   
 The Chair of the Steering Committee shall be elected from among the Steering Committee members for a term of no more than three years. The same Chair can be elected for one additional term. After finishing his/her term, the Chair must leave the Steering Committee for a minimum period of two years before becoming eligible to serve on the Steering Committee again.  
 C. Steering Committee Secretary   
 The Secretary of the Steering Committee shall be elected from among the Steering Committee members for a term of no more than three years. The same Secretary can be elected for one additional term. After finishing his/her term, the Secretary must leave the Steering Committee for a minimum period of two years before becoming eligible to serve on the Steering Committee again. In the absence of a Steering Committee Secretary, the Steering Committee chair shall keep meeting minutes.  
 D. Steering Committee Members   
 The current Steering Committee members in the meeting held at each year’s eScience Conference shall select new members of the Steering Committee. The committee membership is open to all participants of any eScience Conference who have significant experience in the operation of conferences (such as serving as General and/or Program Chairs of past conferences). Any participant interested to serve should indicate their interest to the Steering Committee Chair. The term of office of each member is 3 years, renewable twice for another term of 3 years. After serving 3 terms, a Steering Committee member must be off the Steering Committee for a minimum period of two years before becoming eligible to serve again. (Initial terms will be staggered to insure continuity on the committee). The newly elected members of the Steering Committee take office as soon as the meeting in which they were elected is over.  
 E. Voting Rights   
 During meetings of the Steering Committee, each member shall have one vote  . A quorum both for face-to-face meetings and for email or phone meetings will be a majority (greater than 50%) of the number of members of the Steering Committee. Written proxies may be submitted by electronic or surface post to the secretary or the chair of the Steering Committee. Steering Committee members will be informed sufficiently in advance of any known motions to be voted on during a forthcoming meeting. The chair has the deciding vote in cases of tied votes.  
 F. Steering Committee Meetings   
 A Steering Committee meeting must be held at each eScience. If necessary, interim meetings can be called by the Steering Committee Chair or by a simple majority of the members and can also be held by electronic mail or by other means.  
 Steering Committee members are expected to attend the Steering Committee meeting at each eScience. Members who miss two consecutive meetings at eScience without giving sufficient cause are considered withdrawn from the Committee, subject to review by the Steering Committee.  
 The secretary or another member of the Steering Committee designated by the Chair will take minutes. The Chair and Secretary will both maintain minutes of the past Steering Committee meetings.  
 III. The Advisory Committee   
 A. Purpose   
 To contribute to the long-term planning and success of this conference. The Advisory Committee provides advice to the Steering Committee. It works with the Steering Committee to plan for future conferences evaluate how well each conference has achieved the objectives stated above, and implement improvements to better meet these objectives.  
 B. Advisory Committee Members   
 When a Steering Committee member completes a term of service on the Steering Committee, if that member so desires, he or she can become a member of the Advisory Committee. Advisory Committee membership continues until the member resigns, or a majority of the Steering Committee votes for the Advisory Committee members’ membership to cease.  
 C. Voting Rights   
 Advisory Committee members may participate in discussions with the Steering Committee, but do not vote.  
 IV. Constituting a Conference   
 The Steering Committee obtains, through open and informal solicitations, proposals for: conference locations names of individuals who are suitable to serve as General Chair(s), individuals who are suitable to serve as Program Chair(s), and other organizational issues. Individuals or institutions interested to propose and organize a future eScience should follow the steps listed below.  
 A.  Written proposals for the conference should be sent to the Chair of the Steering Committee significantly before the proposed conference date. The decision on the conference will generally be made at least 24 months before the proposed date.  
 B.  Proposals shall list facilities, venue, proposed management, budgets and financial arrangements, a brief summary of the conference structure, a draft of a preliminary call for papers, and any other information required by the Steering Committee. In particular, the scheduling of any other potentially conflicting meetings within several months before or after the proposed meeting date must be evaluated as part of the proposal.  
 C.  Those wishing to host a future eScience Conference should make their intentions known sufficiently in advance of the proposed date (e.g. 30 months) so that any information required by the Steering Committee can be obtained in a timely manner, and other activities can be integrated into a program of interest to all.  
 D.  The Steering Committee reviews proposals and may seek advise from anonymous reviewers. If the evaluation is positive, the Steering Committee will tentatively accept the proposal, and the proposer(s) will be asked to prepare a detailed budget using the IEEE CS appropriate forms (TMRF) and submit the form to the Steering Committee Chair at least 15 months before the proposed conference date. After approval by the Steering Committee it will be passed to the Society. The IEEE Computer Society will make final approval of the TMRF.

 Santiago of Chile   

 Santiago, also known as Santiago de Chile, is the capital and largest city of Chile as well as one of the largest cities in the Americas. It is the center of Chile’s most densely populated region, the Santiago Metropolitan Region, whose total population is 8 million which is nearly 40% of the country’s population, of which more than 6 million live in the city’s continuous urban area. The city is entirely in the country’s central valley. Most of the city lies between 500–650 m (1,640–2,133 ft) above mean sea level.  
 Founded in 1541 by the Spanish conquistador Pedro de Valdivia, Santiago has been the capital city of Chile since colonial times. The city has a downtown core of 19th-century neoclassical architecture and winding side-streets, dotted by art deco, neo-gothic, and other styles.  

 Santiago’s cityscape is shaped by several stand-alone hills and the fast-flowing Mapocho River, lined by parks such as Parque Forestal and Balmaceda Park. The Andes Mountains can be seen from most points in the city. The city outskirts are surrounded by vineyards and Santiago is within an hour of both the mountains and the Pacific Ocean.  
 Santiago is the political and financial center of Chile and is home to the regional headquarters of many multinational corporations. The Chilean executive and judiciary are located in Santiago, but Congress meets mostly in nearby Valparaíso. Santiago is named after the biblical figure Saint James. The city will host the 2023 Pan American Games.

 Abstract  
 The ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic have contributed in part to a recent upsurge in the study and development of eHealth systems. Although it is almost impossible to cover all aspects of eHealth in a single discussion, three critical areas have gained traction. These include the need for acceptable eHealth architectures, the development of mobile health (mHealth) technologies, and the need to address eHealth system security concerns. Existing survey articles lack a synthesis of the most recent advancements in the development of architectures, mHealth solutions, and innovative security measures, which are essential components of effective eHealth systems. Consequently, the present article aims at providing an encompassing survey of these three aspects towards the development of successful and efficient eHealth systems. Firstly, we discuss the most recent innovations in eHealth architectures, such as blockchain-, Internet of Things (IoT)-, and cloud-based architectures, focusing on their respective benefits and drawbacks while also providing an overview of how they might be implemented and used. Concerning mHealth and security, we focus on key developments in both areas while discussing other critical topics of importance for eHealth systems. We close with a discussion of the important research challenges and potential future directions as they pertain to architecture, mHealth, and security concerns. This survey gives a comprehensive overview, including the merits and limitations of several possible technologies for the development of eHealth systems. This endeavor offers researchers and developers a quick snapshot of the information necessary during the design and decision-making phases of the eHealth system development lifecycle. Furthermore, we conclude that building a unified architecture for eHealth systems would require combining several existing designs. It also points out that there are still a number of problems to be solved, so more research and investment are needed to develop and deploy functional eHealth systems.

 The 27 th  International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems   
  
  14 - 16 June 2023 - Toulouse, France   

 Benh LIEU SONG  , CC BY-SA 3.0  , via Wikimedia Commons    
 Welcome to the website of the 27th International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems (ICECCS 2023)  
  
 The 27th International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems (ICECCS 2023) is a well-established event that has been held around the world for over 25 years. Over the past years, we have seen a rapidly rising emphasis on the design, implementation and management of complex computer systems which are present in every aspect of human activities, such as manufacturing, communications, defence, transportation, aerospace, hazardous environments, energy, and healthcare. These complex systems are frequently distributed over heterogeneous networks and process a large amount of data. Complexity arises from many factors, including the dynamic environment and the scenarios these systems operate in, demanding and sometimes conflicting requirements in functionality, efficiency, scalability, security, dependability and adaptability, as well as the wide range of development methodologies, programming languages and implementation details. Performance, real-time behaviour, fault tolerance, security, adaptability, development time and cost, and long life concerns are some of the key issues arising in the development of such systems.  
 The goal of this conference is to bring together industrial, academic, and government experts from a variety of application domains and software disciplines, to discuss how the disciplines' problems and solution techniques interact within the whole system. Researchers, practitioners, tool developers and users, and technology transfer experts are all welcome. The scope of the conference includes long-term research issues, near-term requirements and challenges, established complex systems, emerging promising tools, and retrospective and prospective reflections of research and development into complex systems.  
 ICECCS is an A-ranked  international conference by the Computing Research and Education Association of Australasia (CORE)  2018 ranking.  
  We look forward to your contribution and participation.

 Keynote Speakers  
 Ana Cavalcanti (University of York)   
 Title.  "Testing automation using RoboStar"   
  Abstract.  The RoboStar framework supports a model-based approach in the development of control software for robotics applications. It provides domain-specific tool-independent notations for modelling and simulation, and techniques for automatic generation of artefacts. In this talk, we focus on the RoboStar techniques for automatic test generation. We can generate tests using reactive design models described in a diagrammatic notation called RoboChart. These tests can be used for animation or converted for execution against simulations, either automatically generated or custom-developed. We target a well-established tool, RT-Tester, and simulations that use ROS (Robot Operating System). Conversion reflects a notion of correctness that compares reactive models to cyclic models that embed the paradigm of simulations, and provides traceability. We present the approach, and its foundations and applications.  
 Bio.  Ana Cavalcanti is a professor at the University of York and a Royal Academy of Engineering Chair in Emerging Technologies. She leads RoboStar, a centre of excellence on software engineering for robotics.  
  The RoboStar approach to model-based software engineering compliments the current practice of design and verification of mobile and autonomous robots, covering simulation, testing and proof. This approach is practical, supported by tools, and yet mathematically rigorous so that it can provide reliable evidence of trustworthiness.  
 Jin-Song Dong (National University of Singapore)   
 Title.  "Probabilistic Reasoning for Sports Analytics"   
  Abstract.  Sports analytics encompasses the utilization of data science, artificial intelligence (AI), psychology, and advanced Internet of Things (IoT) devices to enhance sports performance, strategy, and decision-making. This process involves the collection, processing, and interpretation of cloud-based data from a variety of sources, such as video recordings, performance metrics, and scouting reports. The resulting insights aid in evaluating player and team performance, preventing injuries, and supporting coaches and team managers in making well-informed decisions to optimize resources and achieve superior outcomes. One widely recognized formal method, Probabilistic Model Checking (PMC), has been conventionally employed in reliability analysis for intricate safety critical systems. For instance, the reliability of an aircraft can be determined by evaluating the reliability of its individual components, including the engine, wings, and sensors. Our groundbreaking approach applies PMC to a novel domain: Sports Strategy Analytics. As an example, the reliability (winning percentage) of a sports player can be ascertained from the reliability (success rate) of their specific sub-skill sets (e.g., serve, forehand, backhand, etc., in tennis). In this presentation, we will discuss our recent research work, which involves the application of PMC, machine learning, and computer vision to the realm of sports strategy analytics. At the end of the presentation, we will also discuss the vision of a new international sports analytics conference series https://formal-analysis.com/isace/2023/  ).  
 Bio.  Dr. Jin-Song Dong is a professor at the National University of Singapore. His research spans a range of fields, including formal methods, safety and security systems, probabilistic reasoning, sports analytics, and trusted machine learning. He co-founded the commercialized PAT verification system, which has garnered thousands of registered users from over 150 countries and received the 20-Year ICFEM Most Influential System Award. Jin Song also co-founded the commercialized trusted machine learning system Silas ( www.depintel.com  ). He has received numerous best paper awards, including the ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award at ICSE 2020. He served on the editorial board of ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology, Formal Aspects of Computing, and Innovations in Systems and Software Engineering, A NASA Journal. He has successfully supervised 28 PhD students, many of whom have become tenured faculty members at leading universities worldwide. He is also a Fellow of the Institute of Engineers Australia. In his leisure time, Jin Song developed Markov Decision Process (MDP) models for tennis strategy analysis using PAT, assisting professional players with pre-match analysis (outperforming the world's best). He is a Junior Grand Slam coach and takes pleasure in coaching tennis to his three children, all of whom have reached the #1 national junior ranking in Singapore/Australia. Two of his children have earned NCAA Division 1 full scholarship, while his second son, Chen Dong, played #1 singles for Australia in the Junior Davis Cup and participated in both the Australian Open and US Open Junior Grand Slams.  
 Joao Marques-Silva (CNRS Reserch Director, IRIT Toulouse)   
 Title.  "Disproving XAI Myths with Formal Methods -- Initial Results"   
  Abstract.  The advances in machine learning (ML) in recent years have been both impressive and far-reaching. However, the deployment of ML models is still impaired by lack of trust on how the best-performing ML models make predictions. The issue of lack of trust is even more acute in the uses of ML models in high-risk or safety-critical domains. eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is at the core of ongoing efforts for delivering trustworthy AI. Unfortunately, XAI is riddled with critical misconceptions, that foster distrust instead of building trust. This talk details some of the most visible misconceptions in XAI, and shows how formal methods have been used, both to disprove those misconceptions, but also to devise practically effective alternatives.  
 Bio.  Joao Marques-Silva is a CNRS Research Director (Directeur de Recherche), being affiliated with IRIT in Toulouse, France. He is also one of the Research Chairs of the Artificial and Natural Intelligence Toulouse Institute (ANITI). Before joining CNRS, IRIT and ANITI, Joao Marques-Silva held senior academic appointments at the University of Lisbon in Portugal, the University College Dublin in Ireland, and the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom. Dr. Marques-Silva is a Fellow of the IEEE, and he was a recipient of the 2009 CAV Award for fundamental contributions to the development of high-performance Boolean satisfiability solvers.

 About  
 ICFEC 2023  

 The 7th IEEE International Conference on Fog and Edge Computing (ICFEC 2023) is a leading forum to disseminate and discuss research activities and results on a broad range of topics in the fields of fog and edge computing. ICFEC 2023 will take place in conjunction with The 23rd International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing (CCGrid 2023).  
  
  Fog and edge computing have received much attention by both the research community and the industry in recent years, and are today seen as an alternative to the utilization of cloud-based computational resources. Especially, this is the case in scenarios where large amounts of data are produced in distributed settings, e.g., in the Internet of Things (IoT), where data needs to be processed in (near) real time, or where suboptimal network connectivity hampers the upload of very large amounts of data to the cloud. Use cases for fog and edge computing range from smart factories over smart grids to autonomous vehicles, to name just some examples.  
  
  While tremendous progress has already been made in the research fields of fog and edge computing, there are still numerous challenges which need to be solved. New abstractions and extensions to current programming and storage models are necessary to allow developers to design novel applications that can benefit from massively distributed fog and edge systems. Addressing security, privacy, and trust is of paramount importance while managing the resources and context of mobile, transient and hardware-constrained resources. Fog and edge computing can also help to process very large amounts of data, both for batch processing and data streams. The integration of novel communication protocols and communication patterns with fog and edge computing also brings both new opportunities and unique challenges. Recently, the utilization of fog and edge resources in order to realize distributed machine learning in the form of federated learning has also gained much traction, since it allows to learn from local data without sharing raw data with any centralized entity.

 About ICSSP Conference Series  
 ICSSP 2023 is the 17th in a series of ICSSP conferences that have been organized by the International Software and Systems Process Association (ISSPA) or its predecessor, the International Software Process Association (ISPA). The ICSSP series grew out of two earlier and partly overlapping series, the International Conferences on Software Process (ICSP), dating back to 1991, and the International Software Process Workshops (ISPW), dating back to 1984.  
 Recent ICSSP conferences have mostly been organized with or around ICSE, with proceedings published by ACM or IEEE. The 2021 and 2022 conferences were co-organized with the International Conference on Global Software Engineering (ICGSE), and ICSSP 2022 was co-sponsored and co-organized with the Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute.

 In recent years, innovative software and systems technologies have been rapidly adopted with increasingly widespread but uncertain impacts. These technologies include various forms of AI; big data and data science; blockchain and distributed ledgers; augmented, virtual, and extended reality; low-code/no-code platforms; and even quantum computing (among others). By their novel nature, these new technologies and applications demand new approaches to software and systems development. Beyond that, the novelty and uncertainty surrounding these technologies and applications requires new and more effective approaches and processes to assuring correctness, understandability, predictability, responsibility, security, ethics and other vital qualities of our software and systems.  
 At the same time, many of these new technologies may have applications within the software life cycle. So the question naturally arises, can we put technologies such as AI, blockchain, low code, and big data, to work in improving our ability to develop, manage, and apply new software and systems applications. We can even ask whether it will become essential to do so.  
 ICSSP 2023 is focusing on software and systems processes for and with these new technologies, as well as on incorporating these new technologies into new modes of working in software and systems development for business, government, society, and the environment. ICSSP 2023 aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to share their research findings, experiences, and new ideas on diverse topics related to software and system processes. For 2023, the theme of the conference is: " Software and System Processes for and with Emerging Technologies  ". The goal is to advance both the state of the research and the state of the practice by applying innovative ideas from different fields of research to the future of software and system engineering processes.

 Introduction  
   
 AboutComputing and Processing  
  Keywords:Edge computing,Fog computing,Distributed systems,Cloud computing,computer systems,  
  Scope:A new and disruptive paradigm spear-headed by academics and industry experts is taking shape so that applications can leverage resources located at the edge of the network and along the continuum between the cloud and the edge. The Fog/Edge computing paradigm is expected to improve the agility of service deployments, make use of opportunistic and cheap computing, and leverage the network latency and bandwidth diversities between these resources. Numerous challenges arise when using edge resources, which requires the re-examination of operating systems, virtualization and containers, and middleware techniques for fabric management. The conference seeks to attract high-quality contributions covering both theory and practice over system software and domain-specific applications related to next-generation distributed systems that use the edge.

 Statements about INDIN 2023  

 Kathrin Leiner  
 F&E Technologiesysteme WM, TRUMPF Werkzeugmaschinen SE + Co. KG, Germany  
 The conference was a fantastic event with a large number of highly interesting technical presentations. The topics showcased the current research areas in the industry and the challenges associated with them. The opportunity to network with like-minded people enabled interesting discussions and inspired and motivated me for my further research. Special thanks must go to the excellent organisation of the conference, which ensured that everything ran perfectly well. Overall, the event was an enriching experience that has further strengthened my interest.  

 Marcel Dix  
 Scientist Industrial AI, ABB AG Corporate Research Center Germany  
 A significant number of contributions at this year's INDIN conference concerned the fascinating topic of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This clearly reflects the growing importance of AI at my company ABB as well, as the increasing digital transformation in our industries opens up diverse applications for AI.  
 Here, a challenge will be to make the predictions of AI models more explainable for industrial users, so that AI can genuinely provide valuable support to them. To address this issue, we were truly grateful for the opportunity to host a special session at the INDIN 2023 on the issue of Explainable AI (XAI) and interactive Machine Learning for industrial applications.  
 Our heartfelt appreciation goes to the conference chairs, organizers, and the many dedicated helpers who made this conference an outstanding success, featuring a highly engaging program, all made possible at the cutting-edge university campus of TH OWL in Lemgo.

  About IEEE IRI  
  Data science has become the new frontier for self-driving cars and AI. Such intelligent applications derive from Information Reuse and Integration  (IRI). IRI seeks to maximize the utility of information by creating simple, rich, and cost-effective knowledge representations and ontologies. IRI consequently explores strategies for integrating this knowledge into systems and applications. It plays a pivotal role in the capture, representation, maintenance, integration, validation, and extrapolation of information and the knowledge derived from it; and, it applies both information and knowledge for enhancing decision-making in various application domains.  
 This conference explores three major tracks: information reuse  , information integration  , and reusable systems  . Information reuse  explores the theory and practice of optimizing representations; information integration  focuses on innovative strategies and algorithms for unifying diverse information in novel domains; and reusable systems  focus on developing and deploying models and corresponding processes that enable Information Reuse  and Integration  to play a pivotal role in enhancing decision-making processes in various application domains.  
 The IEEE IRI conference serves as a forum for researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to present, discuss, and exchange ideas that address real-world problems with real-world solutions. Theoretical and applied papers are both included. The conference program will include special sessions, open forum workshops, panels, and keynote speeches.

 Description  

 Data science has become the new frontier for self-driving cars and AI. Such intelligent applications derive from Information Reuse and Integration (IRI). IRI seeks to maximize the utility of information by creating simple, rich, and cost-effective knowledge representations and ontologies. IRI consequently explores strategies for integrating this knowledge into systems and applications. It plays a pivotal role in the capture, representation, maintenance, integration, validation, and extrapolation of information and the knowledge derived from it; and, it applies both information and knowledge for enhancing decision-making in various application domains.  
   
  This conference explores three major tracks: information reuse, information integration, and reusable systems. Information reuse explores the theory and practice of optimizing representations; information integration focuses on innovative strategies and algorithms for unifying diverse information in novel domains; and reusable systems focus on developing and deploying models and corresponding processes that enable Information Reuse and Integration to play a pivotal role in enhancing decision-making processes in various application domains.  
   
  The IEEE IRI conference serves as a forum for researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to present, discuss, and exchange ideas that address real-world problems with real-world solutions. Theoretical and applied papers are both included. The conference program will include special sessions, open forum workshops, panels, and keynote speeches.

 Call for Workshop Proposals  

 SCOPE AND OVERVIEW  
 The 2023 IEEE 20th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Smart Systems will be held in Toronto (Canada), September 25 – 27, 2023. The conference is sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society and IEEE Computer Society’s TCDP. It is a premier annual forum for sharing original, novel ideas in mobile ad-hoc networks and smart systems, defined broadly. As wireless ad-hoc networks continue to evolve and specialize into a number of application scenarios and environments, and sensor-based systems and technologies increasingly permeate our everyday life and become the inner fabric of the Internet of Things and cyber-physical systems, the unfolding of smart environments such as smart cities, smart farming, smart healthcare, and smart manufacturing, to name a few, demand integrated solutions that can make intelligent use of both cloud and edge systems, while applying machine learning and artificial intelligence tools to handle their growing complexity and to leverage the vast amount of available data created.  
 The MASS organizing committee invites proposals for full-day or half-day workshops affiliated with the conference. The purpose of these workshops is to provide a platform for presenting novel ideas in a less formal and possibly more focused way than at the conference itself. The goal is to enable stimulating discussions of state-of-the-art, emerging, visionary, and perhaps controversial topics. Workshop proposals are solicited in all areas and topics related to mobile ad-hoc and smart systems. Addressing emerging research directions in these areas are particularly welcome.  
 Accepted MASS 2023 workshop papers will be included in the conference proceeding published in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library, showing their affiliation with IEEE MASS. We expect all accepted workshops to adhere to a common paper submission (i.e., two-column IEEE conference style, maximum paper length of 6 pages) and reviewing schedule, as outlined in the dates indicated below.  
 SUBMISSION GUIDELINES FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS  
 Each workshop proposal must at least include:  
  1) Full name of the workshop and its intended acronym  
  2) Workshop Organizers (names, affiliation and contact information)  
  3) A short biography of the organizers (up to 200 words for each), highlighting any conferences / workshops chaired  
  4) A brief description (up to 1 page) of the technical issues that the workshop will address, and the reasons why the workshop is of interest to MASS at this time.  
  5) Some consideration of the communities/groups the workshop intends to attract.  
  6) The names and affiliations of at least ten program committee member candidates.  
  7) Planned format of the workshop, including  
  - Duration of the workshop: Half-day, Full-day and tentative schedule  
  - Number of refereed papers, hot topic sessions, keynotes, panels (and panel formats) etc.  
  8) If applicable, a description of past versions of the workshop, including dates, organisers, numbers of submitted and accepted papers, and number of attendees.  
  9) Draft Call for Papers (max 1 page).  
  10) A description of the publicity and promotion plan.  
   
 WORKSHOP PROPOSAL SUBMISSION  
 Workshop proposals should be sent in PDF format to the Workshop Co-chairs (Eirini Eleni Tsiropoulou <eirini@unm.edu>  and Nils Aschenbruck <aschenbruck@uos.de>  ).

 International Conference on Program Comprehension 2023  
   
 The 31st IEEE/ACM International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC 2023) is the premier venue for work in the area of program comprehension. It encompasses both human activities for comprehending the software and technologies for supporting such comprehension. ICPC 2023 promises to provide a quality forum for researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to present and to discuss state-of-the-art results and best practices in the field of program comprehension. ICPC 2023 is co-located with ICSE 2023.  
 ICPC 2023 solicits four main categories of research contributions: research papers, early research achievement (ERA) papers, replications and negative results papers, and tool demos. On top of this, journal first papers from selected journals will be accepted for presentation. Research papers describe original work in the area of program comprehension; ERA papers report early research results with the main goal of fostering discussion at the conference. Replications and negative results papers concern with the re-execution of existing research aimed at strengthening previous findings as well as the presentation of sound empirical methods leading to negative results. Finally, tool demonstrations report about new instruments making available and usable to practitioners program comprehension methods.

 PerCom 2023  
  
 The 21st International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom 2023)   
 March 13-17, 2023 in Atlanta, USA.  

  Conference Overview   
 IEEE PerCom, now in its 21st year, will be held in Atlanta, Georgia (USA), during March 13-17, 2023, as a physical in-person conference. PerCom is the premier annual scholarly venue in pervasive computing and communications. Pervasive computing is constantly at the forefront of mobile systems research, and has found its way into many commercial systems due to tremendous advances in a broad spectrum of technologies and topics such as wireless networking, mobile and distributed computing, sensor systems, ambient intelligence, and smart devices.  
 IEEE Percom 2023 will be held in person. Remote presentations and pre-recorded videos are not allowed unless all authors of an accepted paper are under special circumstances that prevent them from attending the conference in person. Requests for such exceptions will be considered carefully by the organizing committees. We are sympathetic to concerns and sentiments about our in-person focus. We will fully accommodate remote authors/speakers if they have Visa-related travel issues or COVID/health-related travel issues.
