Similar to previous years, ACML 2023 has two publication tracks  . Authors may submit either to: 
Conference Track: | (16-page limit with references) for which the proceedings will be published as a volume of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research Workshop and Conference Proceedings (PMLR).
 Journal Track: | (20-page limit with references) for which accepted papers will appear in a special issue of the Springer Machine Learning Journal (MLJ).
 Please note that submission procedures for the two tracks are different. Please read the instructions carefully before submitting.   
Conference Track 
Submission Deadline: June 30, 2023  June 23, 2023   For the conference track, please submit your manuscript via CMT at: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACML2023  . 
IMPORTANT:   When creating a new submission on CMT, please ensure you choose the "Conference"  track. 
The Latex submission template and style file can be found here: ACML2023_submission_template.zip  . 
 The Latex camera-ready template and style file can be found here: ACML2023_camera-ready_template.zip  . 
Manuscripts must be written in English, be a maximum of 16 pages (including references, appendices, etc.) and follow the PMLR style. If required, supplementary material may be submitted as a separate file, but reviewers are not obliged to consider this. 
All conference track submissions must be anonymized  . Submissions that are not anonymized, over-length, or not in the correct format will be rejected without review. To anonymize, simply leave the author information empty in the Tex template. There is no separate format for anonymizing. 
It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g., in arXiv) as long as it is not cited in the submission. 
Journal Track 
Submission Deadline: June 02, 2023  May 26, 2023   In addition to the conference track, this year’s ACML will run a journal track, similar to previous years. Papers that are accepted to the journal track must be presented at the conference in order to be published. 
IMPORTANT:   Similar to previous years, for the journal track, the abstract and the paper must be submitted to two different systems simultaneously   for the purpose of review management: 
First, please submit ONLY the title and abstract via CMT at: | https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACML2023. | (paper manuscript need not be submitted here). When creating the submission on CMT, please choose the | "Journal" | track.
 Then, please submit the paper via Springer’s Editorial Manager system at: | https://www.editorialmanager.com/mach. | When creating a new submission on Springer’s Editorial Manager, please make sure to choose | "S.I.: ACML 2023" | as the article type.
 For the journal track, manuscripts must be written in English with a maximum of 20 pages (including references, appendices, etc.). For the template and style files, please follow the instructions for authors on the journal website: https://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10994  . 
The journal track will follow the reviewing process of the Machine Learning journal. This includes allowing papers that require minor changes to be resubmitted after a first-round review. The journal track committee will aim to complete the reviewing process in time for this year’s conference. In the unlikely event that the reviewing process for a paper is not completed in time (for this year’s conference), the paper will not be considered for the conference and the review will be completed as a regular submission to the Machine Learning journal. 
The journal track review is single-blind, i.e., the authors’ identity will be visible to reviewers. It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. Submissions that are not in the correct format will be rejected without review. In addition, extended versions of published conference papers are not eligible for journal track submission. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g., in arXiv).
14. ACML_3 conference:

Some of our participants are unfortunately facing visa challenges  that might prevent them from joining us in person at the conference. We understand the immense effort and dedication it takes to contribute to ACM Multimedia 2023, and we want to reassure everyone that even if you cannot attend in person due to unforeseen circumstances, your paper will still be featured in the conference proceedings. Our team is dedicated to ensuring a fulfilling and enriching experience for all participants, whether they attend in person or online. We will do our utmost to accommodate any challenges and ensure a satisfactory conference experience for all. 
In addition, we’d like to inform you that your paper will be presented in a 2-minute teaser session for those attending in person. For those who may not be able to make it in person, we will also have 2-minute teaser sessions in separate offline sessions to ensure your research receives the attention it deserves.  
We hope to see as many of you as possible, and we thank you for your understanding.

Make sure to book your hotel stay at the Westin Hotel,  Ottawa conference hotel. The hotel  is at the center of the conference activity, and will allow you to network easily with other conference attendees. Also, it’s a quick trip to get to the program and functions, and just as quick to nip back to your room for a break. Staying at the conference hotel will provide a better conference experience! 
Everyone enjoys meeting in a comfortable conference venue, offering quality service and support for workshops, tutorials, plenary sessions, and other activities. As the transaction for those services and support, the conference guarantees that a percentage of attendees will stay in the hotel. The contract with the hotel then guarantees a specific number of sleeping rooms will be used each night during the conference. If the conference does not meet the contracted sleeping room commitment, the hotel gets paid anyway. Those unfilled rooms will cost the conference thousands of dollars. 
Please support ACMMM 2023 and SIGMM by staying at the Westin Hotel!

AAAI-23 Main Technical Track 
Call for Papers 
 All authors must complete a reproducibility checklist, which facilitates replication of the reported research.
 All authors are expected to be available to review (light load), unless extenuating circumstances apply.
 NeurIPS-22 Fast Track: rejected papers with *final, average* scores of at least 4.9 may be submitted directly into AAAI-23’s Phase 2 along with, for example, previous reviews and paper ID.
 The purpose of the AAAI conference series is to promote research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and foster scientific exchange between researchers, practitioners, scientists, students, and engineers across the entirety of AI and its affiliated disciplines. AAAI-23 is the Thirty-Seventh AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. The theme of this conference is to create collaborative bridges  within and beyond AI. Like previous AAAI conferences, AAAI-23 will feature technical paper presentations, special tracks, invited speakers, workshops, tutorials, poster sessions, senior member presentations, competitions, and exhibit programs, and two new activities: a Bridge Program and a Lab Program. Many of these activities are tailored to the theme of bridges and all are selected according to the highest standards, with additional programs for students and young researchers. 
Driven by its disciplinary diversity, AAAI has incubated numerous AI sub-disciplines and conferences and has nurtured for decades the cohesion of AI. New communities often emerge when two or more disciplines come together in order to explore new opportunities and perspectives; today both are plentiful. The purpose of this year’s Bridge Program is to tap into new sources of innovation by cultivating sustained collaboration between two or more communities, directed towards a common goal. Our interpretation of bridge  is broad and encompasses disciplines both within and outside of AI. Hence, the communities that our Bridge Program is intended to bring together could be distinct subfields of AI, such as planning and learning, or different disciplines that contribute to and benefit from AI, such as AI and the humanities. 
We plan for AAAI-23 to be an in-person conference and are exploring opportunities to complement this with remote participation. Given the volatile situation, however, the exact format of the conference can only be decided at a later stage.

ADCOM 2023: Adaptive, Generative and Bio-inspired AI in Computing and Communication  
The Advanced Computing and Communications Society  (ACCS) in association with the Digital University Kerala  announces the 28th annual International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications  (ADCOM 2023) at Maker Village, Kochi during 8th – 10th December 2023. 
ADCOM, the flagship Systems Conference of the ACCS, is a major annual international meeting that draws leading scientists and researchers in computational and communications engineering from across industry and academia. ADCOM highlights the growing importance of Large-Scale Systems Engineering and provides the platform to share, discuss and witness leading edge research and trends. 
ADCOM 2023 explores the current state-of-art AI covering a broad spectrum of adaptive, generative and bio-inspired algorithms and/or hardware useful in computing and communications. Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can create new content, such as text, images, or other media, from scratch. Generative AI models are trained on large datasets of existing content, and then use this data to learn the patterns and rules that govern how that content is created. Generative AI has a wide range of potential applications in Content creation, Data augmentation, Artificial intelligence assistant, Entertainment, Product design etc.

Call for papers  
The ACM MobiCom conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions in the field of wireless networking and mobile computing. MobiCom solicits papers that address important research challenges and build practical working systems. Successful papers should propose novel ideas to attack such problems through rigorous analysis, system design and real-world measurement or deployment of mobile networks, systems and applications. 
 
 MobiCom’23 will emphasize novelty and creativity while, at the same time, taking a broader and more inclusive view of wireless and mobile systems research. On one hand, the more novel the concept, the harder it can be to fully develop or evaluate all its aspects. On the other hand the more practical and developed the system, the more simple and sometimes known techniques must be leveraged. The review process will take both cases into account as intellectual merit and novelty can be found in techniques, system designs, implementations, and applications. The review process will also favor papers that describe how the authors will provide access to well-documented datasets, modeling and/or simulation tools, and codebases to support the reproducibility of their methods as well as papers that highlight and discuss not only the significance but also the limitations of the work. 
 
 Unlike in previous years, MobiCom’23 will not have separate categories of challenge, experience, and verification papers. However, we do encourage the submission of experience papers as full papers that provide detailed technical insight into real-world deployments of novel technologies and systems. MobiCom'23 will also incorporate early notifications for papers rejected in round 1 and rebuttals as described below in more detail.

 Two Deadlines, Early Notification, Rebuttals, and One-shot Revision 

 MobiCom 2023 offers authors the option of two deadlines and keeps the one-shot revision process to enhance the timeliness and quality of the scientific results from the research community. Each paper will go through the same rigorous reviewing process as in previous MobiCom conferences. The review process for each deadline will involve two rounds. Papers that are not selected to proceed after the first round will receive an early notification, including reviews. After the second round of reviews, the reviews will be released to the authors and who will have one week to submit a rebuttal. 
 
 Rebuttals 
MobiCom will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to the final consideration of the papers at the program committee meeting. Authors must limit their responses to (a) correcting factual errors in the reviews or (b) directly addressing questions posed by reviewers. Responses should be limited to clarifying the submitted work. In particular, responses must not include new experiments, new data, or new figures, describe additional work completed since submission or promise additional work to follow. 
 
 The submission of a rebuttal is optional. Rebuttals will be limited to a maximum of 1000 words submitted in the online submission form. It is worth noting that available reviews will be released at the above-mentioned times. However, additional reviews might be solicited or submitted after the rebuttal period. 
 
 Final decisions will be one of the following 

 Accept | : Accepted papers will be presented at the MobiCom conference and appear as part of the proceedings and the MobiCom website. Note all the papers in this category will initially be | conditionally accepted | . The papers that go through a successful | anonymous | shepherding process will eventually be accepted.
 Reject | : Rejected after reviewed papers cannot be resubmitted until 11 months have passed since the last MobiCom deadline they were submitted to. We strongly encourage the authors to address reviewers' feedback before re-submitting the paper to MobiCom.
 One-Shot-Revision | : Papers, where a revision is required, will be given specific action points and can be resubmitted for the | next | deadline. For such papers, the reviewers will articulate a maximum of three major changes/clarifications that they would like to see. After the resubmission, the paper will be evaluated based on whether the authors have properly addressed the reviewers’ requests. Unlike in the shepherding process, the requested action points may include running additional experiments that obtain specific results and could take more than 4-6 weeks. During this revision period, the paper is still considered under review to MobiCom and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration.
 
 Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers 
The authors of accepted MobiCom 2023 papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee that will assess how well the submitted artifacts support the work described in the accepted papers. Participation in Artifact Evaluation is voluntary and has no influence on the paper’s acceptance, but is strongly encouraged. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive badges printed on the papers themselves. Additional details on the Artifact Evaluation process can be found here. 
 
 Submission Instructions 

 All paper submissions will be handled electronically at the MobiCom ’23 paper submission website  . Authors should prepare a PDF version of their full paper. All submitted papers will be evaluated through a double-blind  reviewing process, with the identities of the authors withheld from the reviewers. 
 
 Before final submission, you are expected to make sure that your paper complies with the following requirements. Please do not violate these requirements with the aim of including additional material: ​submissions that violate the formatting requirements may not be reviewed​.  You can visually inspect a page-by-page report of your paper format using the same tool as the submission system via a separate ​ online form  . After the submission deadline, we will use the same tool to check the conformance of papers. The format checking tool uses heuristics and can make mistakes. The PC chairs will manually inspect and possibly reject those papers with evident format violations. However, no paper will be rejected due to format violations without being manually checked. 
 
 Any papers that do not adhere to the following guidelines may be immediately rejected:

 Welcome to HAI ’23!   
 The Eleventh International Conference on Human-Agent Interaction (HAI 2023) aims to be the premier interdisciplinary venue for discussing and disseminating state-of-the-art research and results that have implications across conventional interaction boundaries including robots, software agents and digitally-mediated human-human communication. HAI will gather researchers from fields spanning engineering, computer science, psychology and sociology, and will cover diverse topics, including: human-robot interaction, affective computing, computer-supported collaborative work, gaming and serious games, artificial intelligence, and more.  
 The theme for the HAI2023 conference will be “Human Empowerment and Inclusive Society”  . The development of HAI and AI tools in virtual and real contexts has enriched the metaverse and opened up new possibilities in social tasks and for human beings themselves. This has raised questions on the trustworthiness and fairness of these systems. Further, how we can make these systems more equitable and inclusive in their design as they interact with humans. Consequently, the next step we need to take is to carry out in expanding an inclusive society as one of sustainable development goals. It is still unclear how people can live happily amidst the amazing development of technology. While all submissions related to HAI are welcome, you are especially encouraged to submit papers in line with the theme for HAI 2023.

 Why GECCO?  
 The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO) presents the latest high-quality results in genetic and evolutionary computation since 1999. Topics include: genetic algorithms, genetic programming, ant colony optimization and swarm intelligence, complex systems, evolutionary combinatorial optimization and metaheuristics, evolutionary machine learning, evolutionary multiobjective optimization, evolutionary numerical optimization, neuroevolution, real world applications, search-based software engineering, theory, hybrids and more.  
 This is GECCO (Youtube)    

  Lisbon  
 The capital of Portugal, Lisboa in Portuguese, is the westernmost capital city in continental Europe, located on the estuary of the Tagus river. After the 1755 earthquake that destroyed the city, it has been rebuilt as a modern metropolis, earning the title of European City of Culture in 1994. Built on the slopes of rolling hills, the city has retained many of its traditions, such as the fish vendors in their traditional attire and the Phoenician boats that service the harbour. The historical districts, Castle of St. George, Tower of Belém and the Sintra mountains are examples of the multitude of sights for visitors to explore. Lisbon's famous cuisine benefits from the abundance of fresh fish, but also offers delicious meats and cheeses.  
  The conference will be held in hybrid  mode, with all events facilitating online  participation.

  Human Systems Integration 

 Working Group Purpose & Mission   

 Human Systems Integration (HSI) is a transdisciplinary sociotechnical and management approach to systems engineering used to ensure that a system’s technical, organizational, and human elements are appropriately addressed across the whole system lifecycle, service or enterprise system. HSI considers systems in their operational context together with the necessary interactions between and among their human and technological elements to make them work in harmony and cost-effectively, from the early design to disposal.  
 Our mission  is to ensure all design and engineering disciplines include human and socio-technical interaction and integration to enable system performance.

 Scope  

 HSI results from the convergence of Human Factors and Ergonomics  , which provides human-centred and organisation-centred evaluation techniques and tools (HCD), Information Technology  (including AI, Human-Computer Interaction, Modeling and Simulation) and System Engineering,  and the Operational Domain  of the System of Interest (Circle 3 in the figure 1).  HSI can be considered as both an enabling process  associating HCD and SE during the whole lifecycle of a system  , and a product  resulting from this process. Due to the breadth of human considerations and impacts that should be considered by a project - depending on its nature, complexity, and application area - HSI consists of a number of perspectives, such as Safety, Usability, Training, etc (see circle 2, on figure 1) These are used to help ensure that no significant human considerations are missed within requirements analysis, design, evaluation and acceptance testing, and risk management. These perspectives are not exhaustive and the degree to which they each apply will vary from project to project.  

 Figure  2  .   HSI emerges from the overlapping of three main  c  i  rcles   : (1) technology, organization, and people    
   
 within an environment at the heart; (2) examples of HSI perspectives; and (3) contributing disciplines    
   
 associated with the Operational Domain at stake in the periphery.   

 Goals  

 The HSI WG aims to demonstrate the value of HSI as an integral part of the Systems Engineering effort and to develop associated practices, resources, organizations, and training to support the Systems Engineering community's adoption of HSI.  
 Stay forefront of evolving SE practices to ensure that the presence of humans is integrated into the engineering in order to deliver successful sociotechnical systems across their life cycle. 
  Foster a community of practitioners from the contributing disciplines (System Engineering, Human Factors and Errgonomics, Information Technology, and Operational Domains) and develop a common framework.

  September 18 - 22, 2023 / Ivano-Frankivs’k, UKRAINE   
 on ICT in EDUCATION, RESEARCH,  
  and INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS    
 18th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE   
   
  September 18 - 22, 2023 / Ivano-Frankivs’k, UKRAINE   
 on ICT in EDUCATION, RESEARCH,  
  and INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS    
 18th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE   

 Dear Colleague,  
 ICTERI supports and respects all the aspects that help promote diversity in our conference community, which aspires to facilitate a truly international and multicultural gathering. Though we prefer physical assembly for the conference as the most effective mean for scientific exchange and community building, we fully understand that some people might be under higher risk or stricter constraints, like international travellers. This is the reason for our decision to run ICTERI 2023 in a hybrid mode  , which combines physical assembly and virtual participation for those colleagues, who are unable to attend physically due to valid reasons.  
 The information about the arrangements and requirements  related to the hybrid mode  of the conference are provided and updated at http://icteri.org/icteri-2023/hybrid/    
 ICTERI Conference Language  is ENGLISH  
 ICTERI  is a peer-reviewed  International Computer Science  conference that brings together academics and practitioners interested in the technological advances and business applications of Information and Communication Technologies and Infrastructures.  
 ICTERI focuses on real world applications  ; therefore authors should highlight the benefits of their results or experience for industry and services, in addition to academic world. Papers describing advanced prototypes  , systems  , tools  and techniques  and general survey  papers indicating future directions  are also encouraged. Both technological  and methodological  submissions are welcome. All papers must describe original work  , not previously published or submitted elsewhere.  
 ICTERI offers its infrastructure and facilities for the organizers of satellite Workshops   that match the scope of the conference.  
 ICTERI also hosts a PhD Symposium   for young researchers who are at the beginning of their career, such as Master  or PhD students  and also young researchers from industry  . It is a venue that provides expert environment for the presentation of the tractable ideas  and early results  of PhD projects or other research aiming at receiving a PhD.  
 ICTERI is also open to those who would like to give interactive presentations  of their research or demonstrations  of their software at the Poster and Demo Track  .  
  Starting from 2023, ICTERI publishes its post-proceedings (Main Conference, Poster, and PhD Symposium tracks) volume with Springer  in their CCIS Series   (approved by Springer for 2023). This is an international and highly reputable venue for conference and workshop proceedings. Springer post-proceedings volume contains the papers accepted by the ICTERI Program Committee   and is published shortly after the conference. ICTERI Springer CCIS volumes  are indexed by: DBLP   , EI-Compendex   , Mathematical Reviews   , SCImago   , Scopus   .  
 ICTERI 2023 does not charge any conference fee. Participation is free  .

 MROL 2023  

 6 th  International Workshop on Methods, Resources and Technologies for Open Learning and Research (MROL 2023)   
 Co-located with the 18 th  International Conference on ICT  in E  ducation, R  esearch, and I  ndustrial Applications: Integration, Harmonization, and Knowledge Transfer (ICTERI 2023)  
 September 18, 2023, Vasyl Stefanyk Precarpathian National University, Ivano-Frankivsk – Ukraine http://icteri.org/icteri-2023   
 Proceedings: CEUR-WS, indexed by DBLP, Scopus, Web of Science.  
  International e-journal “Information Technologies and Learning Tools” (indexed by Web of Science)  
 MROL 2023 at a Glance   
 This Workshop is designed to consider the state of the art and potential benefit of new and emerging adaptive technologies application within the open systems of higher education. The aim is to explore the use of open education and research methods, resources and technologies for forming the creative and ICT competent person in view of European Research Area development. That have to meet the priorities of open education, open science, open communication and open data access and delivery, the wide use of cloud-based learning tools, platforms and infrastructures to support learning and research. Workshop topics are related to big data, smart data, data and resources of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), adaptive data processing and analytics, smart learning and research environments to provide effective technologies for data access and processing within the open pedagogical systems of higher education.  
 The Workshop aims at:  
 (i) Exploration and use of open education and open research tools, resources and methods for forming the creative and ICT competent person in view of European Research Area development.  
 (ii) Considering and evaluating the realization of the design and development of open systems of higher education.  
 Workshop Language: English   
 No Fees   
 The Workshop does not charge any conference fee. Participation is FREE; ICTERI 2023 sponsors cover expenses.  
 ICTERI 2023 will run in a hybrid mode  , which combines physical assembly and virtual participation for those colleagues, who are unable to attend physically due to valid reasons.  
 The Scope of MROL   
 Nowadays, an effective and promising approach to open pedagogical systems design is the use of the cloud computing technologies to provide ICT support for the functioning and development of the computer-based educational and research environment. Innovative technological solutions for learning environment organization and design using cloud computing (CC) and ICT outsourcing show promise and usefulness. The challenges of making the ICT infrastructure of the university environment fit the needs of its users, taking maximum advantage of modern network technologies, and ensuring the best pedagogical outcomes leads to the search for the most reasonable ways of its modernization.  
 The cloud-based approach is to ensure the processes of open learning giving way for broader access to quality learning resources, supporting the processes of collaborative learning and also making the learning environment available for the user practically from any place and at any time.  
 The open science processes are related to open access to research data, open discussion and analysis of research results and open communication with society. To support these processes, the corporate or hybrid cloud-based university environments are useful as the essential components (accomplishments) for the resources of the various public information networks such as research infrastructures and social networks. Thus, the analysis of the principles and essential features of the structure and design of the cloud-based learning and research university environment becomes additionally valuable because of its the open science processes support.  
 The Workshop should lead to benchmarking the state of the art and defining the future prospects of the open systems of higher education design and development, with the focus on the most valuable trends, methods, tools and technologies driving the innovative development of educational environment.  
 The learner’ competencies needed for the open educational and research systems development including higher responsibility, collaborative skills, leadership, creative thinking, taking the problem in general and others are to be considered and explored.  
 Topics of interest  include, but are not limited to:  
 Cloud-based Educational and Research Environment Design 
  ICT and Methods of Distance and Enhanced Learning 
  Smart-systems: Models, Technologies and Resources – STEM Education, Learning Robotics, Knowledge Extraction, Engineering and Management, Learning and Scientific Analytics

 The Power of Good Old-Fashioned AI for Urban Traffic Control  
  Abstract   
 The current worldwide increasing trend in urbanisation is aggravating urban traffic congestion’s social, economic, and health burdens. The introduction of new means of transport, such as Connected Autonomous Vehicles, and the rise of Artificial Intelligence, is enabling a paradigm shift in urban traffic management and control from existing reactive to proactive traffic control: proactive control paradigms can preemptively address issues, mitigating the negative impact on mobility.   
 In this paper we provide an overview of the work done in the area by the Huddersfield AI for Urban Traffic Management and Control research team.

 Automated Design of a Neuroevolution Program Using Algebra-Algorithmic Tools  
  Abstract   
 The adjustment of the previously developed algebra-algorithmic tools towards the automated design and generation of programs that use neuroevolutionary algorithms is proposed. Neuroevolution is a set of machine learning techniques that apply evolutionary algorithms to facilitate the solving of complex tasks, such as games, robotics, and simulation of natural processes. The developed program design toolkit provides automated construction of high-level algorithm specifications represented in Glushkov’s system of algorithmic algebra and synthesis of corresponding programs based on implementation templates in a target programming language. The adjustment of the toolkit for designing neuroevolutionary algorithms consists in adding the descriptions and software implementations of the relevant elementary operators and predicates to a database of the toolkit. The use of the toolkit is illustrated by an example of designing and generating a program for the single-pole balancing problem, which applies the neuroevolutionary algorithm of the NEAT-Python library. The results of the experiment consisting in the execution of the program generated with the algebra-algorithmic toolkit are given.

 On Randomization of Reduction Strategies for Typeless Lambda Calculus  
  Abstract   
 It is well known that the functional programming paradigm provides certain advantages, namely increasing the reliability of software development, improving software verification and validation, providing software artefact reusability, and scaling software solutions. But this paradigm is not free from disadvantages also. The most serious of them are redundant memory usage and low-performance productivity. The ideas concerning the implementation of randomization mechanisms into reduction strategies, which is a significant part of the kernel of functional computing systems, are considered in the paper. The authors present simulation tools for studying such a mechanism and give their grounding. They also present the experimental results of the comparison analysis of variants reduction randomization.

 Solving Sokoban Game with a Heuristic for Avoiding Dead-End States  
  Abstract   
 This paper focuses on applying reinforcement learning methods to solve the game Sokoban. This game is a popular puzzle, relatively easy for humans to solve. However, it poses a significant challenge for computer algorithms due to the irreversible nature of certain moves. To predict which actions will lead to such undesirable states is often difficult for a learning agent – a common problem in tasks requiring planning. We propose using a Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm and a heuristic convolution neural network (CNN) specially trained to separate undesirable, neutral, and desired game states to address this issue. We experimented with different heuristic variations of algorithms and compared them against each other. We have implemented MCTS in two different setups: one with a CNN trained using data obtained during the solving process and one without such training. We also varied the number of rollouts for each move in MCTS and compared the results. The paper’s research question was how to improve the performance of learning agents in tasks that require planning to avoid unwanted states.

 Information System for Calculating the Shortest Route for a Mobile Robot in a Multilevel Environment Based on Unity  
  Abstract   
 An integral part of the global task of increasing the efficiency of movement processes and performing specified technological operations by a mobile robot is the choice of a movement path from the initial (starting) to the final (target) point. At the same time, a preliminary assessment of the proposed route of movement is an important stage in the development of a program for its movement. In this paper, we consider the problem of finding the shortest path for moving the mobile robot in a multilevel environment, taking into account the features of transitions between levels, restrictions, the presence or absence of obstacles along the way. An information system for calculating the shortest route from the starting point to the target point is proposed based on the NavMesh navigation system in the Unity virtual environment. The results of computer simulation of robot movement in a multilevel environment show that the system successfully finds the shortest route for various scenarios.

 Analysis and Systematization of Vulnerabilities of Drone Subsystems  
  Abstract   
 A drone is a software (SW) and hardware (HW) complex that has wireless data transfer technologies (Wi-Fi, LTE, 5G, Bluetooth, etc.) To transfer data, it uses various communication protocols: both specific and generally known.   
 Drones can perform complex tasks, but some cyber-attacks (such as Denial-of-Services - DoS) can lead to the failure of individual components of the drone and the entire system as a whole.   
 Guidelines for protecting against drone attacks are provided by many organizations that develop cybersecurity standards (NIST, CERT, CISA, etc.). Methods to prevent cyber-attacks can be used to drones, with adjustments to their parameters and architectural features. There are also recommendations for protecting drone components and also methods of communication protocols protection from cyber-attacks.   
 The authors of this study offer a comprehensive approach to the analysis of vulnerabilities of drone subsystems, which includes a system analysis of drone architecture, vulnerability analysis by different vulnerability databases, and their systematization.

 Helicopters Turboshaft Engines Parameters Identification Using Neural Network Technologies Based on the Kalman Filter  
  Abstract   
 The work is a continuation of the research devoted to the development of a multidimensional Kalman filter connected at the output of the built-in helicopter’s turboshaft engines mathematical dynamic model to improve the accuracy of helicopters turboshaft engines parameters identification and achieve high quality automatic control. The main difference is the use of radial basis functions neural networks, in which the multivariate Kalman filter is a training algorithm. The work illustrates well-known mathematical expressions underlying of optimal multidimensional filtering algorithms. The methods of mathematical modeling in the Matlab environment tested the proposed algorithms. The simulation results showed that the use of neural networks trained by the multidimensional Kalman matrix filter as part of the model of helicopters turboshaft engines built into the automatic control system allows achieving high indicators of the accuracy of identifying the parameters of helicopters turboshaft engines automatic control system – up to 0.9975, then in practical analogues.

 Modification of Fuzzy TOPSIS Based on Various Proximity Coefficients Metrics and Shapes of Fuzzy Sets  
  Abstract   
 The relevance of this work lies in the need for qualitative evaluation of innovative projects, which are characterized by various technical and economic indicators, and, as a rule, significant capital investments are required for their implementation. The use of multi-criteria methods, in particular the modified Fuzzy TOPSIS, will allow to increase the accuracy of decision-making when choosing the optimal innovative project. The purpose of the work is to select the optimal innovative project through the use of the developed software application based on the modified Fuzzy TOPSIS method, as well as to investigate the influence of the parameters of the specified method on the decision-making result. To modify the Fuzzy TOPSIS method, the Euclidean distance, the Hamming distance, and the Chebyshev distance were used to determine the proximity coefficients. Another element of the modification of the Fuzzy TOPSIS method was the ability to calculate results using various fuzzy numbers, such as triangular, trapezoidal, and Gaussian. A comparative analysis of the obtained results with other multi-criteria decision-making methods was carried out. A data entry template for experts has also been created and the results presented in a clear and easy-to-read format.

 Design and Implementation of Didactic Process Based on Simulation  
  Abstract   
 The problem of designing didactic processes has not been solved to this day, although some specific issues are considered. The article presents a generalized approach model based on the reference ADDIE model including the organisational level to the design and implementation of the didactic process. The model uses Bloom’s taxonomy and Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences. The model has been modified towards a dynamic design oriented on quality, efficiency and adaptive learning. A competency-based decomposition is used. The lowest level of decomposition is the activities level where the information flows as well as the learning and forgetting are taken into account. The competences-objectives-activities-data linking is discussed. The level of activities is represented in the form of an electrical-like network. The network represents differential equations describing dynamic learning and forgetting as well as the structure and information flows of the didactic process. The element models can be easily extended. The networks can be simulated and optimized. The results can be used during the design process. The simulation result as well as the structure of network equations enables inference. The article presents the results of simulations of some aspects of didactic processes including scheduling and sequencing, gap effect, workload, predicting achievements and effectiveness.

 Self-directed Learning in Chemistry Laboratory via Simulations  
  Abstract   
 Self-directed learning is seen as a key competence for survival in the twenty-first century. Self-directed learning is not about learning; instead, it is a meta-theory about learning how to learn. During the pandemic process, many theoretical and applied courses were conducted via distance education. One of these courses is the general chemistry laboratory. While the laboratory course was conducted with distance education, simulation applications were used. For the general chemistry laboratory experiments, first of all, theoretical lectures were made over zoom. Afterwards, the students performed experiments using simulation. The aim of this research is to determine the effect of the general chemistry laboratory conducted with distance education and simulations on the chemistry laboratory self-efficacy. The research was designed in a quasi-experimental design model. The sample group of the research consists of 25 pre-service chemistry teachers studying at a state university. Data were collected with the chemistry laboratory self-efficacy scale. The data obtained from the chemistry laboratory self-efficacy scale were analyzed. As a result of the research, it was determined that the simulation-supported laboratory application had a significant effect on the psychomotor self-efficacy and cognitive self-efficacy of the pre-service teachers. According to the results of the research, pre-service teachers are worried and afraid that they will not be able to do the experiment in the laboratory, so simulations are effective in increasing psychomotor and cognitive self-efficacy as they are very useful for preparation for the experiment.

 Stock Market Crashes as Phase Transitions  
  Abstract   
 In this study, we apply the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis concepts to financial time series that helps to determine the onset of a crash in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index. For the studied index we emphasize 4 the most influential stock market crashes: Wall Street Crash of 1929, Black Monday of 1987, Financial crisis of 2007–2008, and 2020 stock market crash. We present that economic crashes on a mapping with multifractality phenomena demonstrate a dynamic phase transition. Some of the presented multifractal measures appear to be analogues of free energy and specific heat, and can be used as indicators or indicators-precursors of the stock market crashes.

 Data Analysis for Predicting Stock Prices Using Financial Indicators Based on Business Reports  
  Abstract   
 Increased access to the stock market leads to a growing interest in investing and an increase in the number of new investors. However, investing in the stock market involves risks and requires good preparation and analysis. To protect and grow their investments, investors should carefully analyze the company they plan to invest in. Our paper aims to develop a model for predicting financial indicators from companies’ business reports based on data analysis and machine learning using Python programming language.   
 Tasks of our research contain the collection of historical data from business reports or financial databases, data cleaning, and feature selection of relevant explanatory variables (such as net income, price-to-earnings ratio, total equity, operating margin, and gross margin) to predict the dependent variable (market price per share). Random Forest outperformed Multiple Linear Regression in predicting stock prices, displaying lower RMSE (9.53), Deviation Percentage (34.61%), and higher R-squared (97.22%).   
 The Deviation Percentage of 34.61% may seem relatively high, suggesting that there is still room for improvement in the model’s precision in predicting stock prices accurately. It is essential to consider other factors that might affect stock prices beyond the selected financial indicators.   
 The conclusion emphasizes the importance of considering additional market factors, such as competition, economic conditions, and industry changes when making investment decisions. Although the random forest model is an effective tool for analyzing the dependence of stock prices on various variables, it does not account for all factors affecting stock prices. Therefore, investors should use market analysis to make the correct investment decisions.

 Artificial Intelligence Impact on Food Security of States in the World  
  Abstract   
 Because food crisis is so wide-reaching, there is a strong a need in the transformation of world agriculture and food production sector. The innovative digital technologies, namely AI, are widely acknowledged as a solution for enhancing food crises management and agricultural productivity. The purpose of this paper is to research the linkage between food security and artificial intelligence against the backdrop of global digitalization processes by using cluster analysis (SOM algorithm). The level of impact of AI on food security is deployed in ascending order for clusters Absence, Starter, Adopter, Frontrunner. Countries with more developed digital infrastructure are better able to respond to current food security threats and build resilience for the future. Due to development of digital economy and AI solutions, the level of food security for clusters of Adopter, Frontrunner is largely higher than for countries with low level of digitalization and AI diffusion (clusters of Absence, Starter). Furthermore, the level of agriculture value added correlates with AI application and country’s economic development. The more country’s economy depends on agriculture, the lower is country’s food security level and the slower is country’s digitalization.

 Increasing Investment Portfolio Profitability with Computer Analysis Trading Strategies  
  Abstract   
 The paper is devoted to our research on the effectiveness of using different middle- and long-term trading strategies based on computer analysis (CA) indicators. This paper contains a brief overview of three technical analysis indicators that are usually used for getting buy or sell signals for some specific financial instruments (FIs). We have described the approach that allows using such signals not only for a single FI but for a whole investment portfolio. The initial investment portfolio is generated using Markowitz’s Modern Portfolio Theory. The paper contains an overview of similar approaches presented by other researchers. During the experimental part of the research, we compared the effectiveness of using such CA indicators as moving average (MA), relative strength index (RSI), and support and resistance (S&R). The results prove that using certain CA strategies allows not only to increase the initial investment portfolio profitability on rising periods in the financial market but also may reduce loss during a global financial market recession.

 Quality Assessment and Assurance of Machine Learning Systems: A Comprehensive Approach  
  Abstract   
 Machine learning (ML) is opening up new opportunities for the development of innovative systems across a wide range of industries. However, assessing and ensuring the quality of systems with ML components introduces unique challenges related to inherent characteristics of such components like data centricity and unpredictable behavior. Traditional software quality assessment and assurance methods may not be sufficient for ML systems: (1) they focus on software code, while ML systems’ quality is influenced by the characteristics of the data and the algorithms used to create ML components; (2) they do not cover the emerging quality characteristics specific to ML systems, such as interpretability, explainability, fairness and trustworthiness. This PhD project aims to develop a comprehensive approach for assessing and assuring the quality of ML systems, with a focus on bias detection and prevention. The research will (1) explore the problem of bias in production ML systems; (2) analyze the gaps in existing software quality models and methods related to bias detection and prevention; and (3) propose an improved approach to quality assessment and assurance to address the challenges associated with bias in ML systems. The results of this PhD project are expected to contribute to the development of better models and methods for assessing and assuring the quality of ML systems, as well as have practical implications for industries that rely on ML systems to automate complex tasks, facilitate decision-making processes and gain insights from large amounts of data.

 Vulnerability Detection of Smart Contracts Based on Bidirectional GRU and Attention Mechanism  
  Abstract   
 The paper is devoted to methods of detecting vulnerabilities of smart contracts using machine learning. The purpose of the study is to improve the accuracy of detecting the reentrancy vulnerability of smart contracts by implementing new machine learning models. A thorough analysis of the current literature was performed and the shortcomings of the existing tools for detecting vulnerabilities of smart contracts were identified. In particular, insufficient accuracy and low adaptability of existing models to new vulnerabilities were noted. To solve these problems, a new model based on a kind of recurrent neural networks with a gating mechanism, namely a bidirectional GRU with an attention mechanism, was proposed to detect the reentrancy vulnerability at the Solidity code level. Using the Word2vec model, the source code of smart contracts was transformed into an array of vectors and used as input to the neural network. Precision, recall and F-beta score were used to evaluate the developed model. 500 smart contract source codes from the Ethereum blockchain were used to train the model, 250 of which had the reentrancy vulnerability. The constructed model was compared with Simple RNN, LSTM, BLSTM, BGRU and BLSTM-ATT models. The obtained results showed that the developed model is ahead of the listed models. The closest values of the metrics were obtained by the BLSTM-ATT model, while the developed BGRU-ATT model uses significantly fewer parameters that need to be optimized, which reduces the training time of the model to detect new vulnerabilities.

 Modeling the Resource Planning System for Grocery Retail Using Machine Learning  
  Abstract   
 The reach of online grocery services has expanded to encompass new customer segments in recent years. During the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, when delivery slots were limited and customer demand was high, click-and-collect models became increasingly popular. In order to keep pace with evolving customer behavior, it is crucial for retailers to maintain a high degree of operational process efficiency within their business model. This research paper proposes a resource planning system for grocery retail delivery services that utilizes machine learning techniques. The system aims to optimize the allocation of resources, such as delivery drivers, and reduce transport costs, improving the overall efficiency and profitability of the delivery operations. The system is designed to capture and analyze data from various sources, including delivery orders, traffic patterns, weather conditions, and driver schedules. The proposed research demonstrates the potential of machine learning techniques to transform resource planning in grocery retail delivery services and highlights the importance of Data-Driven decision-making in today’s highly competitive retail landscape.

 Organization of Independent Work of Students in LMS Moodle Using a Metacognitive Approach (on the Example of Physical and Mathematical Disciplines)  
  Abstract   
 Recent years of the covid pandemic and military threats have significantly exacerbated the need for young people to obtain university education remotely. This also increases the requirements for the effectiveness of using the didactic capabilities of digital means and tools of distance education, and the quality of relevant content for organizing and supporting students’ independent educational activities. Able to effective independent cognitive activity can only be a person who has the appropriate cognitive skills, and is aware of his own cognitive processes. Therefore, filling students’ independent work with metacognitive content should be considered as the subject and purpose of training, along with the traditional goal of the university, which is the formation of subject knowledge and skills. The subject of our research is the use of means and tools of LMS Moodle for the organization of independent work of students based on a metacognitive approach in the study of physical and mathematical disciplines. The article analyzes the problems of organizing students’ independent work and offers some ways to solve them using the Moodle functionality. Examples of the use of individual Moodle activities by the article’s authors for the organization and support of independent work of students are given.

 Digital Technologies as a Means of Forming Subject-Methodical Competence Future Primary School Teachers  
  Abstract   
 The article updates the problem of the application of digital technologies in various professional methods and their integration in the educational process of institutions of higher pedagogical education. According to the authors, the formation of subject-methodical competence of future primary school teachers is not possible without the formation of abilities: navigate in the information space, use existing and, if necessary, create new electronic resources; use modern digital technologies in the educational process. For the formation of professional skills and abilities in students of pedagogical specialties, the quality of educational content of a methodological nature, created by means of digital technologies, is essential.   
 In accordance with the purpose of digital technologies and their application in professional teaching methods, the most effective sets of programs and applications were determined for students to create educational and methodological support for the educational process in primary school. Such as: mind maps (summary diagram of interactive lessons), presentations (demonstration of educational materials), comics (visualization of educational information in frames-pictures), word clouds (visualization of educational content in keywords), infographics (visualization and structuring of a large amount of educational information), virtual boards (coordination of work in groups in class, during the web quests, organization of student communication), interactive tasks and online tests (creation of exercises to acquire skills, development of tasks and tests to reveal knowledge and skills).

 Approaches and Economic Benefits of Property Registers Digitalization: Evidence from Ukraine  
  Abstract   
 Modernization of the system of the property registers and cadastres is an essential component for the development of society, automation of services providing, optimization of register’s operating costs, efficient operation of subsidy and tax systems, and reduction of property fraud. An analysis of the current state of the property public registers system has been given. It has been established that considering Ukraine’s historical development, it is expedient to modernize the existing information systems and ensure information interaction between the existing registers and cadastres, but not develop the new system (property cadastre). The interoperability of the data in property information systems has been described. The functions of the main stakeholders on property registration (land surveyors, a state employee of the state architectural service, local government architects and private engineers, and state registrars of property rights) have been described in the form of a case UML diagram.

 The Computer Security Foundations Symposium (CSF) is an annual conference for researchers in computer security, to examine current theories of security, the formal models that provide a context for those theories, and techniques for verifying security. It was created in 1988 as a workshop of the IEEE Computer Society's Technical Committee on Security and Privacy, in response to a 1986 essay by Don Good entitled “The Foundations of Computer Security—We Need Some.” The meeting became a “symposium” in 2007, along with a policy for open, increased attendance. Over the past two decades, many seminal papers and techniques have been presented first at CSF. For more details on the history of the symposium, visit CSF's home  .  
 The program includes papers, panels, and a poster session. Topics of interest include access control information flow, covert channels, cryptographic protocols, database security, language-based security, authorization and trust verification techniques, integrity and availability models, and broad discussions concerning the role of formal methods in computer security and the nature of foundational research in this area.

 Start date  4  Dec  2023   To  -   End date  7  Dec  2023     

  The Eleventh International Conference on Human-Agent Interaction (HAI 2023) aims to be the premier interdisciplinary venue for discussing and disseminating state-of-the-art research and results that have implications across conventional interaction boundaries including robots, software agents and digitally-mediated human-human communication. HAI will gather researchers from fields spanning engineering, computer science, psychology and sociology, and will cover diverse topics, including: human-robot interaction, affective computing, computer-supported collaborative work, gaming and serious games, artificial intelligence, and more.  
 The theme for the HAI2023 conference will be “Human Empowerment and Inclusive Society”  . The development of HAI and AI tools in virtual and real contexts has enriched the metaverse and opened up new possibilities in social tasks and for human beings themselves. This has raised questions on the trustworthiness and fairness of these systems. Further, how we can make these systems more equitable and inclusive in their design as they interact with humans. Consequently, the next step we need to take is to carry out in expanding an inclusive society as one of sustainable development goals. It is still unclear how people can live happily amidst the amazing development of technology. While all submissions related to HAI are welcome, you are especially encouraged to submit papers in line with the theme for HAI 2023.

 Background and motivation  
 The distinctive feature of modern IT and Telecommunications industries is in dramatic shortening of the period when technology remains commercially viable. On the one hand, this is due to the competition between key market players that are pushing all manufacturers to accelerate innovations; on the other hand, this is due to technological progress speed up caused by the growing expansion of intellectual resource invested into R&D and design activities. This trend is an important call and challenge for the leading educational and research institutions around the globe. In the FRUCT we believe that it is crucial to support practical cooperation between universities and industrial research. We also target in increasing visibility of involved research teams and set direct personal contacts between academic and industrial experts.

 October 16-20, 2023  
 Welcome to Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love!  
 In its 13th year, the Conference on Cognitive and Computational Aspects of Situation Management (CogSIMA) is heading to the first Capital of the United States: CogSIMA 2023 will take place between October 16-20 at Drexel University  in Philadelphia, PA.  
 The CogSIMA conference series provides an annual venue for presenting multi-disciplinary research on complex heterogeneous dynamical systems – of interacting humans, machines, computer agents and/or networks – whose individual and/or collective behavior depends on their situation awareness.  
 Examples of systems include command and control systems, disaster monitoring and recovery systems, human-robot teams, physical and cyber security situation awareness systems, intelligent transportation systems, health care medical situation control systems, and many others.  
 Common to these systems is the need to adequately perceive, reflect, act, and communicate according to the current situation and expected changes – both in the environment and within the systems themselves.  
 The CogSIMA conferences are aimed at researchers and practitioners from academia, industry and government, with a wide variety of backgrounds and experience including computer science, human factors, cognitive science, modeling and simulation, robotics, and systems engineering.

 The 13th annual Conference on Cognitive and Computational Aspects of Situation Management ( CogSIMA  ) will be held in Behrakis Hall at Drexel University, from October 16-19, 2023. Hasan Ayaz  , PhD, associate professor in the School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems, is the organizing committee chair of this year's conference.  
   
  The Cognitive Situation Management (CogSIMA) conference series provides an annual venue for presenting multi-disciplinary research on complex heterogeneous dynamical systems – of interacting humans, machines, computer agents and/or networks – whose individual and/or collective behavior depends on their situation awareness.  
   
  The CogSIMA conferences are aimed at researchers and practitioners from academia, industry and government, with a wide variety of backgrounds and experience including computer science, human factors, cognitive science, modeling and simulation, robotics, and systems engineering.  
   
  Since 2011, the CogSIMA conferences have promoted a multidisciplinary approach to research on dynamic, cyber-physical-social systems of systems, emerging from the interaction of people, machines, computer systems and organizations situated in complex dynamic environments. Critical to these systems of systems are their cognitive and computational capabilities to (1) sense, perceive, comprehend, and predict situations; (2) reason about and recommend possible actions for situations; (3) facilitate learning, self-organization and collective intelligence; and (4) assess inter-dependencies between systems.  
   
  Continuing in its successful, interdisciplinary tradition, CogSIMA 2023  will provide an inspiring forum for scientists and practitioners from diverse backgrounds including cognitive science, computer science, artificial intelligence, psychology, and human factors.

 CVPR 2023 Visas  
 The CVPR'23 organizing committee deeply regrets that many members of our community could not receive visas to attend CVPR 2023. For several months, the organizers have actively raised concerns with Canadian immigration authorities (IRCC), government agencies, and politicians. In some cases, we have been successful in helping people obtain visas, but in many cases, our efforts were unsuccessful. The organizers acknowledge that the international representation of members from all over the world is what has made CVPR successful. We share in the frustration of those who were unable to attend. We continue to allow virtual to in-person registration switches for attendees who receive their visas before the conference.  
 Russian Invasion of Ukraine  
 CVPR condemns in the strongest possible terms the actions of the Russian Federation government in invading the sovereign state of Ukraine and engaging in war against the Ukrainian people. We express our solidarity and support for the people of Ukraine and for all those who have been adversely affected by this war.  
 Warning About Attendee List / Hotel Vendor Scams  
 The IEEE/CVF CVPR Conference does not sell or rent its attendee list. Please forward all attendee list solicitations to Carmen Saliba < csaliba@computer.org  >. Furthermore, we strongly encourage you to book your rooms through the event room block or directly with a reputable hotel to avoid hotel vendor scams.

 Cognitive Situation Management  

 Obituary  
  We are very saddened by the passing of our Technical Committee’s Co-Chair Dr. Melita Hadzagic, who bravely fought lung cancer since 2021 and died peacefully in her sleep on the 22nd of July, at home, surrounded by her family. She served as Chief Scientist at OODA Technologies, Inc. in Canada, as Research Scientist at NATO STO CMRE, La Spezia, Italy, and as Research Scientist at CNRS UMR5218, Laboratoire de l’IMS, Université de Bordeaux, France. Melita will be remembered for the rigor and love of her work in the field of Information Analysis and Fusion. She will remembered for her contribution to the success of the IEEE SMC Technical Committee on Cognitive Situation Management and its CogSIMA conference series, as well as her involvement at other international conferences, her devotion to her family and friends around the world, her positivity and joy of life, and finally, her resilience and courage in the face of illness. Her warm and generous spirit will be fondly remembered by all who knew her.  

 Mission  
 The Technical Committee on Cognitive Situation Management sees its mission in the following:  
 Creating a rich, diverse and comprehensive scientific research environment for advancing the science, applications, and education in the field of cognitive situation management by fostering inter-disciplinary approaches from computer science, human-centered artificial intelligence, cognitive science, human factors research and other related fields; 
  Organizing scientific conferences, workshops and technical sessions to provide researchers, practitioners and government personnel effective forums for exchanging ideas and result to promote advancements in the field of cognitive situation management; 
  Promoting and supporting publications of research and application papers, dedicated special issues and reports in journals, magazines and in electronic media; 
  Encouraging, advising and educating young researchers in the field of cognitive situation management; 
  Promoting and facilitating inter-disciplinary scientific cooperation with other professional societies and events within IEEE and other international organizations, esp. exploring synergies with other SMCS Technical Committees focusing related research fields or enabling technologies and application areas for Cognitive Situation Management. 

 Background  
 In many of today’s dynamic, data-rich domains, characterized by complex interactions between multiple agents (such as traffic control, infrastructure and cybersecurity monitoring, disaster response and crisis management, communications and defense), maintaining situation awareness becomes increasingly challenging for both human and non-human actors. Yet, an agent’s situation awareness represents the foundation for its informed decision making to take the appropriate actions for reaching its goals, whereas undesirable outcomes can often be traced back to a lack of situation awareness prompting the wrong course of action. Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, such as Large Language Models (e.g., ChatGPT), driver assistance systems or autopilots, offer unprecedented technical capabilities of augmenting their human users’ capabilities and assisting their decision making. Yet, these have already revealed their intricacies when being deployed in complex socio-technical systems, triggering novel problems like the generation of mis- and disinformation or AI overreliance, thereby potentially rather impairing the overall system’s situation awareness and thus performance if these effects are not appropriately considered.  
 Therefore, the research field of cognitive situation management promotes a holistic, inherently interdisciplinary approach to addressing these challenges, incorporating the complex interactions within socio-technical-cyber systems and treating situations as first-class citizens in information processing. This involves tackling the questions of how computational systems can assess and reason upon situations and exchange this information with their human users, how to improve and measure shared situation awareness of human-machine systems, and further challenges in this realm.  
 Often situations involve a large number of inter-dependent dynamic entities that change their states in time and space, and engage with each other into fairly complex relations. For effectively managing situations, it is crucial to understand the situations in which these entities participate, to recognize emerging trends and potential threats, and to undertake required actions. Understanding of dynamic situations involves complex cognitive modeling of situations, building situation ontologies, and continuous sensing, perception, and comprehension of signal and human intelligence events and reports, and integrating these data into suitable presentations for supporting human and/or computational understanding of the situations. Entities participating in Situation Management need to have efficient ways of exchanging descriptions of situations.  
 Cognitive Situation Management thus covers analysis, modeling, and control of cyber-physical-social systems within the context of tactical and strategic goals of stakeholders, and it is based on theories and technologies of computer science, human-centered artificial intelligence, autonomous control, cognitive science and human factors research, among others. The research interests of cognitive situation management in human-centric systems as well as artificial systems built from autonomous smart software-intensive components include studies in situation awareness, situation modeling, ontologies and semantics; situation sensing, fusion, perception, comprehension, and projection; situated reasoning, situation learning and discovery, situation monitoring and control, situation management architectures and applications, situated HCI, distributing, sharing, and merging knowledge about situations; assessing truthfulness and accuracy of situation awareness, the design of systems to support human situation awareness, the development of effective approaches for integrating humans and autonomous systems.

  Statement on Russian-affiliated Papers in the CCC Program  
 The CCF board extensively discussed the issue of allowing papers from scientists affiliated with Russia in the CCC program. Allowing them was not an easy decision, but it is one we feel is aligned with CCF's principles. We condemn the Russian Federation's war on Ukraine in the strongest possible terms. Our inclusion of some papers with Russian-affiliated authors is in no way to be construed as an endorsement of the Russian government or its actions.

43. CCC_3 conference:
CCC'23: Call for Papers  
 Submission Deadline: Friday, February 10, 2023, 23:59 AoE  
   
 Scope  
 The conference seeks original research papers in all areas of computational complexity theory, studying the absolute and relative power of computational models under resource constraints. We welcome contributions from all topics with connections to or motivated by questions in complexity theory, broadly construed. Papers that expand the reach of complexity theory, or raise important problems that can benefit from the perspective and techniques of computational complexity are encouraged. Possible topics include but are not limited to:  
  
 Complexity classes 
  Reducibility and completeness 
  Circuit complexity 
  Communication complexity 
  Algebraic complexity 
  Proof complexity 
  Complexity in other concrete computational models 
  Interactive and probabilistic proof systems 
  Logic and descriptive complexity 
  Pseudorandomness and derandomization 
  Average case complexity 
  Quantum computation 
  Parametrized complexity 
  Fine-grained complexity 
  Complexity-theoretic aspects of: | coding theory 
  cryptography 
  optimization (including inapproximability, continuous optimization) 
  property testing 
  streaming and sublinear computation 
  distributed computation 
  game theory 
  machine learning 
  
 Submission  
 Deadlines:  Papers must be submitted electronically via the submission server  , and received by Friday, February 10, 2023, 23:59 AoE  . Notification of acceptance will be sent by May 1, 2023  , and final camera-ready copies of accepted papers will be due in mid May 2023  .  
 Format:  Submissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper; each author's name, affiliation, and email address; and an abstract of 1-2 paragraphs summarizing the paper's contributions. A submission must contain within its first 10 pages  a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including discussion of its importance, prior work, and an outline of key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims (similar to the content of a brief oral presentation). There is no bound on the total length of a submission, but material other than the abstract, references, and the first 10 pages is considered as supplementary and will be read at the committee's discretion.  
 Submissions should include proofs of all central claims.   
 The submission should be in single-column format, use at least 11-point font, and have standard margins and spacing between lines. Submissions deviating from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. Instructions for formatting camera-ready versions will be communicated to the authors of accepted papers.  
 Additional remarks:  In addition to the submission, authors may optionally send a short email to the program committee (PC) chair at ccc2023chair@easychair.org  containing any additional remarks for the PC, such as the relationship with independent/concurrent work, differences from prior versions conflict of interest statements, or clarifications concerning prior reviews of the work.  
 Conflict of interest:  We expect PC members and reviewers to recuse themselves from the evaluation of any submission, if they would not be able to give an objective opinion due to some conflict of interest (COI). Some examples why a COI may arise are being a thesis advisor, being an immediate family member or close friend, sharing a recent institutional affiliation or being a close collaborator. Any author may write to the PC chair at ccc2023chair@easychair.org  if there is a COI that may not be covered by the above measure. They need only give the names and affiliations of the people with whom a COI exists; no explanation is required. The COI will be held in confidence by the PC chair.  
 Simultaneous submission policy:  Material which has been previously published in a journal or another conference proceedings, or which is scheduled for publication prior to August 2023, will not be considered for acceptance. Simultaneous submission of the same or essentially the same material to another conference with published proceedings is not allowed.  
 Confidentiality:  All submissions will be treated as confidential, and will only be disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees.  
 Publication  
 Online posting:  Authors are encouraged to post full versions of their submissions in a freely accessible on-line repository such as the Electronic Colloquium on Computational Complexity  or the arXiv  . It is hoped that authors of accepted papers will make full versions of their papers publicly available by the camera-ready deadline.  
 Proceedings:  The conference proceedings will be published under a Creative Commons  BY license in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics  (LIPIcs) series. Publication in the conference proceedings does not preclude subsequent journal publication.  
 Presentation:  Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their work at the conference. The program committee will determine time allocations for presentations (between 15 and 45 minutes).  
 Awards  
 Best student paper award:  This award will be given to the best paper written solely by one or more students as judged by the program committee. A paper is eligible if all authors are full-time students on the day of the submission deadline. Authors should indicate their eligibility by using the check-box for this on the submissions page. The program committee may decline to make the award or may split it among several papers. Funding for the best student paper award is provided by EATCS  .  
 Best paper award:  This award will be given to the best paper submitted to the conference as judged by the program committee. The program committee may decline to make the award or may split it among two or more papers. Full versions of the papers chosen by the program committee to receive the best paper award will be invited for submission to the Journal of the ACM  .  
 Special journal issue:  The program committee will invite full versions of a select number of conference submissions to a special issue of the journal Computational Complexity  .  
 Conference Information  
 Dates and location:  The conference will be held from Tuesday, July 18 to Thursday July 20, 2023  in Warwick, UK and will be preceded by a day of tutorials on Monday, July 17, 2023 ( TO BE CONFIRMED  )  . In case public health measures related to COVID-19 make physical events infeasible, they will be held in a virtual online format. The details of the conference format will be posted in due course.  
 Travel allowances:  In order to defray the costs of attending the conference, travel allowances will be offered to students and post-doctoral fellows. More information will be made available on the conference webpage in due time.

  MSST 2023 Tutorials—Birds of a Feather, Monday, May 22   
 7:30 — 8:15 Registration / Breakfast   
 8:15 — 9:45   
 Large Scale File/Storage System Indexing with the Grand Unified File Index ( Presentation  )   
 Jason Lee, Dominic Manno, Gary Grider, LANL   
 As filesystems become larger and larger, management of the data stored in these filesystems becomes more and more complex and time consuming. Querying filesystem metadata with standard tools can take hours or even days due to the sheer amount of metadata to be processed and how standard tools go about processing the metadata. Some filesystems provide custom tools that assist in querying their metadata, but there is no unified set of tools to do so. Additionally, such tools are usually reserved for administrators, not users. The Grand Unified File Index (GUFI) solves all these issues and more. GUFI provides a set of highly performant, parallel tools that allow for complex queries to be applied to the metadata of arbitrary filesystems. The GUFI toolset can be used by both administrators as well as users without violating permission semantics. Indices from disconnected filesystems can be combined, allowing for queries across multiple filesystems at once. This session will provide a high-level overview of GUFI as well as a tutorial on using GUFI.   
 9:45 — 10:00 Break   
 10:00 — 11:30   
 Cybersecure File Shares for Unstructured Data Including Multi-Level Security ( Presentation  )   
 Jonathan Halstuch, RackTop Systems   
 Data security is a top priority for organizations who need to protect sensitive information including research, intellectual property, PII, and health records from cyber threats. Organizations need solutions that can provide security, demonstrate continuous compliance, and sustain the operational pace of the organization. Organizations are turning towards a data-centric zero trust approach to secure their data.  
   
  Join this tutorial to understand and discuss: A data-centric zero trust approach to network attached storage 
  How and why to employ a multi-level security (MLS) solution with demonstration 
  Deployment options, performance, and use cases 
  Live implementation of a cyberstorage NAS 
  Demonstration of the system stopping a live cyberattack 
    
 11:30 — 12:30 Lunch   
 12:30 — 1:15   
 Scalable, High-Performance S3 Object Storage on Tape Media ( Presentation  )   
 Horst Schellong, Point Software and Systems   
 A software-defined S3 object storage supporting tape as storage class, combines the advantages of tape technology (low energy consumption, high capacity, media disruption, ...) with the functional possibilities of object-oriented data storage (scalability, availability, performance, security, ...). The mini-tutorial explains the architecture and technical benefits of this approach and the resulting use cases.   
 1:15 — 2:45   
 OpenZFS New Features Including Direct/IO and Compression/Erasure Offloads ( Presentation  )   
 Brian Atkinson, Jason Lee, LANL   
 Kelly Ursenbach, Eideticom   
 ZFS is an open source volume manager and file system that provides many built-in data integrity and data transformations features. We will discuss two projects that LANL has been working on, with industry partners, to improve overall ZFS performance with NVMe devices. The first project adds support for O_DIRECT in ZFS, reducing the number of memory copies that occur in the ZFS code path which, in turn, reduces memory bandwidth pressure. The ZFS Interface for Accelerators (Z.I.A.) project offloads CPU- and memory-bandwidth-intensive operations to local and remote computational storage devices.  
   
  We seek to get a sense of what operations ZFS users would like to see offloaded to computational storage devices other than the ones that have already been offloaded.   
 2:45 — 3:00 Break   
 3:00 — 4:30   
 Standards-Based Parallel Global File Systems and Automated Data Orchestration with NFS ( Presentation  )   
 David Flynn, Trond Mykelbust, Douglas Fallstrom, Hammerspace   
 High-performance computing applications, web-scale storage systems, and modern enterprises increasingly have the need for a data architecture that will unify at the edge, and in data centers, and clouds. These organizations with massive-scale data requirements need the performance of a parallel file system coupled with a standards-based solution that will be easy to deploy on machines with diverse security and build environments.  
   
  Join this tutorial to discuss: How to unify data created in different clusters and locations into a single namespace, and place locally to applications and compute for processing/AI. 
  Latest technologies available to deliver parallel file system performance from data sets stored in a hybrid cloud environment. 
  The latest in standards-based technologies available for data orchestration and storage at mass scale.

 Hammerspace Solution: No Compromises  

 Hammerspace software is designed from the ground up to scale up and out to accommodate even extreme workload requirements, enabling customers to parallelize performance across any vendor storage, network, or cloud resource they prefer.   
 At the core is its high-performance Parallel Global File System that can span on-premises and cloud instances to provide a cross-platform global namespace to all users everywhere. It is built with a scale-out architecture that can saturate any network, storage type or interconnect.   
 With Hammerspace, all users in all locations see the same file system metadata, even for environments spanning multiple on-prem and cloud-based storage and compute environments. And with metadata-driven objective-based policies, data management is automated behind the scenes across silos and locations without interrupting users or applications. Most importantly, it can now keep up with your high-performance workloads.   
 Hammerspace is designed to help research organizations and other HPC environments create, process, and manage even extreme volumes of HPC data, and to enable collaboration across a decentralized environment.   

 Hammerspace is a software-defined solution that can run on bare-metal, VMs and in the cloud. Hammerspace clusters can scale out to accommodate extreme performance within the datacenter as well as to span as many as 16 locations concurrently, including on-prem and multiple cloud instances.

 IEEE VGTC Virtual Reality Best Dissertation Award  

 About the Award  
 The IEEE VGTC Virtual Reality Best Dissertation Award is presented each year to the author of the most outstanding Ph.D. dissertation, defended during the preceding two calendar years, in the broad areas of virtual and augmented reality. The award is presented at the IEEE VR Conference  , where the winner is also invited to give a short talk about the dissertation work. The award is sponsored by the IEEE Visualization and Graphics Technical Committee (VGTC)  and the IEEE VR Steering Committee.  

 Eligibility  
 Individuals whose dissertations were defended within the two-year window before the submission deadline are eligible. For example, eligible nominees for the 2025 award include the authors of all relevant dissertations defended between January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2023.  
   
  Resubmissions of unsuccessful nominations from prior years are welcome, as long as the dissertation defense date remains within the period of eligibility. If the dissertation defense date and the dissertation filing date are sufficiently different as to create ambiguity in determining the appropriate start of the period of eligibility for the dissertation to be considered for this award, the candidate may elect for their work to be classified as belonging to the period they prefer; however once defined this determination cannot be changed, so that no work may be considered more than twice. There is no limit on the number of nominations that can be made for candidates affiliated with any single institution or advisor.  

 Nominations  
 Individuals may nominate themselves, or may be nominated by their academic advisor(s). Nomination materials should be sent by email to the evaluation committee chair, Maud Marchal, and must include all information described here.  

 1. Basic information  
 The title and abstract of the dissertation 
  The name of the candidate 
  The name of the candidate's primary advisor 
  The institution where the dissertation was defended 
  The date of the dissertation defense. 

 2. Additional documents  
 Summary of significance | : A 1-2 page summary of the significance and impact of the dissertation research. 
  Dissertation | : An electronic copy of the full dissertation, or a pointer to where it can be obtained. 
  Letter of recommendation | : One letter of recommendation, up to 2 pages in length, ideally from the candidate's primary advisor. 
  List of publications | : A list of publications produced from the dissertation work. 

 Nomination Deadline for 2025 Award:  
  July 1st  August 31st, 2024  
 Submit a nomination    

 Evaluation  
 All nominations will be carefully reviewed by a committee of experts. Factors that will be considered when choosing the winning entry include: the significance and impact of the scholarly contributions  of the work, and the clarity with which these contributions are communicated  .

 Abstract:   
 The 37th MSST storage conference will be held the week of May 22, 2023 at Santa Clara University. As an initial resumption of the traditional in-person conference, MSST 2023 will hold three days of events, including five tutorials on Monday May 22 about file systems, storage, and metadata. The Invited Track runs on Tuesday May 23 and Wednesday May 24. Several panels are planned and breaks are provided to encourage the hallway conversations which have also been a proud part of the MSST tradition. There is a mix of talks, ranging from production systems to highly speculative research, and a few broader perspective type analyses.

 Competition Abstracts:  
 Dynamic Constrained Multiobjective Optimization  
 In the past decade, dynamic constrained multiobjective optimization has attracted increasing research interest. The problem is widely-spread in real-world applications, such as scheduling optimization, and resource allocation, which involve time-varying multiobjective and constraints. More especially, the corresponding dynamic constrained multiobjective optimization problems (DCMOPs) contain more complex characteristics and special difficulties than those of dynamic multiobjective optimization problems or constrained multiobjective optimization problems. To promote the research on dynamic constrained multiobjective optimization (DCMO), 10 benchmark functions are developed, covering diverse characteristics which exactly represent different real-world scenarios, for example, continuity-disconnection, time-dependent PF/PS geometries, dynamic infeasible region, small feasible region, and so on. Based on the test suite with various characteristics, researchers can better understand the strengths and weaknesses of DCMOEAs, stimulating the research on dynamic constrained multiobjective optimization.  
 Evolutionary Multi-task Optimization  
 Evolutionary multitasking opens up new horizons for researchers in the field of evolutionary computation. It provides a promising means to deal with the ever-increasing number, variety, and complexity of optimization tasks. More importantly, rapid advances in cloud computing could eventually turn optimization into an on-demand service hosted on the cloud. In such a case, a variety of optimization tasks would be simultaneously executed by the service engine where evolutionary multitasking may harness the underlying synergy between multiple tasks to provide consumers with faster and better solutions. The test suites for multi-task single-objective optimization (MTSOO) and multi-task multi-objective optimization (MTMOO) each contain nine MTO complex problems and ten 50-task MTO benchmark problems. Potential participants in this competition may target either or both of MTSOO and MTMOO while using all benchmark problems in the corresponding test suites.  
 Single Objective Bound Constrained Numerical Optimization  
 Single-objective numerical optimization is an important class of problems to be solved. All new evolutionary and swarm algorithms are tested on single-objective benchmark problems. The aim of this competition is to test the algorithms fairly, and automatically online. The competitors submit their algorithms through the online competition system.  
 Constrained Multimodal Multiobjective Optimization  
 The aim of this competition is to promote research on constrained multimodal multiobjective optimization (CMMO) and hence motivate researchers to formulate real-world practical problems. In this competition, multiple sets of CMMO test problems of different properties are presented, such as problems with different shapes of CPSs and CPFs, different relationships between UPSs and CPSs, scalable number of CPSs, decision variables, and objectives. In addition, a fair and appropriate evaluation criterion and reference data are given to assess the performance of different CMMO algorithms. We encourage all researchers to test their algorithms on the CEC’23 test suite and to submit their papers to a special session on Constrained Multimodal Multiobjective Optimization.  
 Large-scale Continuous Optimization for Non-contact Measurement  
 In this competition, there are two tracks: large-scale continuous single- and multi-objective optimization in two non-contact measurement cases. We carefully select six LSOPs for each track from two tasks, i.e., non-contact voltage measurement for multiconductor systems (NVM) and non-contact current measurement for multiconductor systems (NCM). Participants are encouraged to develop the algorithm to solve this type of optimization problem, not just a specific one of them. Participants may propose a new optimization algorithm or utilize a hybrid form of previously proposed algorithms. However, it must be restricted to the field of evolutionary computing.  
 Evolutionary Computation in the Energy Domain: Operation and Planning Applications  
 This CEC 2023 competition proposes two tracks in the energy domain: (1) Risk-based optimization of aggregators’ day-ahead energy resource management (ERM) considering the uncertainty of high penetration of distributed energy resources (DER). This testbed represents a centralized day-ahead ERM in a smart grid with a 13-bus distribution network using a 150-scenario case study with 10 scenarios considering extreme events (high impact, and low probability). (2) Transmission Network Expansion Planning. Long-term transmission network expansion planning (TNEP) is a classic problem of power systems. The objective is to find the optimal expansion plan that identifies the transmission lines that must be installed in the system to allow a proper operation within a predefined planning horizon with the lowest investment cost. The optimal expansion plan should define where and how many lines should be installed.  
 Competition on Multiobjective Neural Architecture Search  
 The advancement of neural architecture search (NAS) has facilitated the automation of deep learning network design, leading to improved performance on various challenging computer vision tasks. Due to the black-box nature of NAS, the complex properties from the optimization point of view (e.g., discrete decision variables, multimodal and noisy fitness landscapes, expensive and many objectives, etc.) pose a great challenge to EMO algorithms. In the Multiobjective Neural Architecture Search Competition, participants should use an EMO algorithm designed by themselves to solve the given NAS tasks. The algorithms used can be brand-new or adapted from previously proposed algorithms but must be relevant to the field of evolutionary computation. We provide an end-to-end pipeline, dubbed EvoXBench, to generate benchmark test suites for EMO algorithms to run efficiently without requiring GPUs or Pytorch/Tensorflow.  
 Competition on Seeking Multiple Optima in Dynamic Environments  
 Dynamic multimodal optimization problems (DMMOPs) are a class of dynamic problems with multiple optima (sometimes including the accepted local optima) in each environment. Many real-world optimization problems have both dynamic and multimodal properties, such as dynamic economic dispatch problems, dynamic load balancing problems, and so on. The objectives and/or constraints of these problems vary over time, requiring the optimization algorithms to fast-track as many optimal solutions as possible in each environment. This allows decision-makers to pick out the most satisfactory optimal solution in each environment according to their experiences and preferences, or to turn to a different solution if the current one cannot work well. In this competition, benchmarks are constructed by 8 multimodal functions and 8 change modes.  
 A Sandbox for Teaching and Learning in CI for Pre-University and Undergraduate Students  
 The idea is to create a young student workshop with an associated competition during CEC 2023 inspired by the F.I.R.S.T. robotics competition. Before or during the first hours of the event, students will receive learning materials and guidance from tutors to learn about a CI-related topic. Later students will be enabled to test learned materials in a simple real-world application. Namely, programming robots to solve various tasks.
