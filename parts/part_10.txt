Similar to previous years, ACML 2023 has two publication tracks  . Authors may submit either to: 
Conference Track: | (16-page limit with references) for which the proceedings will be published as a volume of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research Workshop and Conference Proceedings (PMLR).
 Journal Track: | (20-page limit with references) for which accepted papers will appear in a special issue of the Springer Machine Learning Journal (MLJ).
 Please note that submission procedures for the two tracks are different. Please read the instructions carefully before submitting.   
Conference Track 
Submission Deadline: June 30, 2023  June 23, 2023   For the conference track, please submit your manuscript via CMT at: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACML2023  . 
IMPORTANT:   When creating a new submission on CMT, please ensure you choose the "Conference"  track. 
The Latex submission template and style file can be found here: ACML2023_submission_template.zip  . 
 The Latex camera-ready template and style file can be found here: ACML2023_camera-ready_template.zip  . 
Manuscripts must be written in English, be a maximum of 16 pages (including references, appendices, etc.) and follow the PMLR style. If required, supplementary material may be submitted as a separate file, but reviewers are not obliged to consider this. 
All conference track submissions must be anonymized  . Submissions that are not anonymized, over-length, or not in the correct format will be rejected without review. To anonymize, simply leave the author information empty in the Tex template. There is no separate format for anonymizing. 
It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g., in arXiv) as long as it is not cited in the submission. 
Journal Track 
Submission Deadline: June 02, 2023  May 26, 2023   In addition to the conference track, this year’s ACML will run a journal track, similar to previous years. Papers that are accepted to the journal track must be presented at the conference in order to be published. 
IMPORTANT:   Similar to previous years, for the journal track, the abstract and the paper must be submitted to two different systems simultaneously   for the purpose of review management: 
First, please submit ONLY the title and abstract via CMT at: | https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACML2023. | (paper manuscript need not be submitted here). When creating the submission on CMT, please choose the | "Journal" | track.
 Then, please submit the paper via Springer’s Editorial Manager system at: | https://www.editorialmanager.com/mach. | When creating a new submission on Springer’s Editorial Manager, please make sure to choose | "S.I.: ACML 2023" | as the article type.
 For the journal track, manuscripts must be written in English with a maximum of 20 pages (including references, appendices, etc.). For the template and style files, please follow the instructions for authors on the journal website: https://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10994  . 
The journal track will follow the reviewing process of the Machine Learning journal. This includes allowing papers that require minor changes to be resubmitted after a first-round review. The journal track committee will aim to complete the reviewing process in time for this year’s conference. In the unlikely event that the reviewing process for a paper is not completed in time (for this year’s conference), the paper will not be considered for the conference and the review will be completed as a regular submission to the Machine Learning journal. 
The journal track review is single-blind, i.e., the authors’ identity will be visible to reviewers. It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. Submissions that are not in the correct format will be rejected without review. In addition, extended versions of published conference papers are not eligible for journal track submission. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g., in arXiv).
14. ACML_3 conference:

Some of our participants are unfortunately facing visa challenges  that might prevent them from joining us in person at the conference. We understand the immense effort and dedication it takes to contribute to ACM Multimedia 2023, and we want to reassure everyone that even if you cannot attend in person due to unforeseen circumstances, your paper will still be featured in the conference proceedings. Our team is dedicated to ensuring a fulfilling and enriching experience for all participants, whether they attend in person or online. We will do our utmost to accommodate any challenges and ensure a satisfactory conference experience for all. 
In addition, we’d like to inform you that your paper will be presented in a 2-minute teaser session for those attending in person. For those who may not be able to make it in person, we will also have 2-minute teaser sessions in separate offline sessions to ensure your research receives the attention it deserves.  
We hope to see as many of you as possible, and we thank you for your understanding.

Make sure to book your hotel stay at the Westin Hotel,  Ottawa conference hotel. The hotel  is at the center of the conference activity, and will allow you to network easily with other conference attendees. Also, it’s a quick trip to get to the program and functions, and just as quick to nip back to your room for a break. Staying at the conference hotel will provide a better conference experience! 
Everyone enjoys meeting in a comfortable conference venue, offering quality service and support for workshops, tutorials, plenary sessions, and other activities. As the transaction for those services and support, the conference guarantees that a percentage of attendees will stay in the hotel. The contract with the hotel then guarantees a specific number of sleeping rooms will be used each night during the conference. If the conference does not meet the contracted sleeping room commitment, the hotel gets paid anyway. Those unfilled rooms will cost the conference thousands of dollars. 
Please support ACMMM 2023 and SIGMM by staying at the Westin Hotel!

AAAI-23 Main Technical Track 
Call for Papers 
 All authors must complete a reproducibility checklist, which facilitates replication of the reported research.
 All authors are expected to be available to review (light load), unless extenuating circumstances apply.
 NeurIPS-22 Fast Track: rejected papers with *final, average* scores of at least 4.9 may be submitted directly into AAAI-23’s Phase 2 along with, for example, previous reviews and paper ID.
 The purpose of the AAAI conference series is to promote research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and foster scientific exchange between researchers, practitioners, scientists, students, and engineers across the entirety of AI and its affiliated disciplines. AAAI-23 is the Thirty-Seventh AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. The theme of this conference is to create collaborative bridges  within and beyond AI. Like previous AAAI conferences, AAAI-23 will feature technical paper presentations, special tracks, invited speakers, workshops, tutorials, poster sessions, senior member presentations, competitions, and exhibit programs, and two new activities: a Bridge Program and a Lab Program. Many of these activities are tailored to the theme of bridges and all are selected according to the highest standards, with additional programs for students and young researchers. 
Driven by its disciplinary diversity, AAAI has incubated numerous AI sub-disciplines and conferences and has nurtured for decades the cohesion of AI. New communities often emerge when two or more disciplines come together in order to explore new opportunities and perspectives; today both are plentiful. The purpose of this year’s Bridge Program is to tap into new sources of innovation by cultivating sustained collaboration between two or more communities, directed towards a common goal. Our interpretation of bridge  is broad and encompasses disciplines both within and outside of AI. Hence, the communities that our Bridge Program is intended to bring together could be distinct subfields of AI, such as planning and learning, or different disciplines that contribute to and benefit from AI, such as AI and the humanities. 
We plan for AAAI-23 to be an in-person conference and are exploring opportunities to complement this with remote participation. Given the volatile situation, however, the exact format of the conference can only be decided at a later stage.

ADCOM 2023: Adaptive, Generative and Bio-inspired AI in Computing and Communication  
The Advanced Computing and Communications Society  (ACCS) in association with the Digital University Kerala  announces the 28th annual International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications  (ADCOM 2023) at Maker Village, Kochi during 8th – 10th December 2023. 
ADCOM, the flagship Systems Conference of the ACCS, is a major annual international meeting that draws leading scientists and researchers in computational and communications engineering from across industry and academia. ADCOM highlights the growing importance of Large-Scale Systems Engineering and provides the platform to share, discuss and witness leading edge research and trends. 
ADCOM 2023 explores the current state-of-art AI covering a broad spectrum of adaptive, generative and bio-inspired algorithms and/or hardware useful in computing and communications. Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can create new content, such as text, images, or other media, from scratch. Generative AI models are trained on large datasets of existing content, and then use this data to learn the patterns and rules that govern how that content is created. Generative AI has a wide range of potential applications in Content creation, Data augmentation, Artificial intelligence assistant, Entertainment, Product design etc.

Call for papers  
The ACM MobiCom conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions in the field of wireless networking and mobile computing. MobiCom solicits papers that address important research challenges and build practical working systems. Successful papers should propose novel ideas to attack such problems through rigorous analysis, system design and real-world measurement or deployment of mobile networks, systems and applications. 
 
 MobiCom’23 will emphasize novelty and creativity while, at the same time, taking a broader and more inclusive view of wireless and mobile systems research. On one hand, the more novel the concept, the harder it can be to fully develop or evaluate all its aspects. On the other hand the more practical and developed the system, the more simple and sometimes known techniques must be leveraged. The review process will take both cases into account as intellectual merit and novelty can be found in techniques, system designs, implementations, and applications. The review process will also favor papers that describe how the authors will provide access to well-documented datasets, modeling and/or simulation tools, and codebases to support the reproducibility of their methods as well as papers that highlight and discuss not only the significance but also the limitations of the work. 
 
 Unlike in previous years, MobiCom’23 will not have separate categories of challenge, experience, and verification papers. However, we do encourage the submission of experience papers as full papers that provide detailed technical insight into real-world deployments of novel technologies and systems. MobiCom'23 will also incorporate early notifications for papers rejected in round 1 and rebuttals as described below in more detail.

 Two Deadlines, Early Notification, Rebuttals, and One-shot Revision 

 MobiCom 2023 offers authors the option of two deadlines and keeps the one-shot revision process to enhance the timeliness and quality of the scientific results from the research community. Each paper will go through the same rigorous reviewing process as in previous MobiCom conferences. The review process for each deadline will involve two rounds. Papers that are not selected to proceed after the first round will receive an early notification, including reviews. After the second round of reviews, the reviews will be released to the authors and who will have one week to submit a rebuttal. 
 
 Rebuttals 
MobiCom will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to the final consideration of the papers at the program committee meeting. Authors must limit their responses to (a) correcting factual errors in the reviews or (b) directly addressing questions posed by reviewers. Responses should be limited to clarifying the submitted work. In particular, responses must not include new experiments, new data, or new figures, describe additional work completed since submission or promise additional work to follow. 
 
 The submission of a rebuttal is optional. Rebuttals will be limited to a maximum of 1000 words submitted in the online submission form. It is worth noting that available reviews will be released at the above-mentioned times. However, additional reviews might be solicited or submitted after the rebuttal period. 
 
 Final decisions will be one of the following 

 Accept | : Accepted papers will be presented at the MobiCom conference and appear as part of the proceedings and the MobiCom website. Note all the papers in this category will initially be | conditionally accepted | . The papers that go through a successful | anonymous | shepherding process will eventually be accepted.
 Reject | : Rejected after reviewed papers cannot be resubmitted until 11 months have passed since the last MobiCom deadline they were submitted to. We strongly encourage the authors to address reviewers' feedback before re-submitting the paper to MobiCom.
 One-Shot-Revision | : Papers, where a revision is required, will be given specific action points and can be resubmitted for the | next | deadline. For such papers, the reviewers will articulate a maximum of three major changes/clarifications that they would like to see. After the resubmission, the paper will be evaluated based on whether the authors have properly addressed the reviewers’ requests. Unlike in the shepherding process, the requested action points may include running additional experiments that obtain specific results and could take more than 4-6 weeks. During this revision period, the paper is still considered under review to MobiCom and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration.
 
 Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers 
The authors of accepted MobiCom 2023 papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee that will assess how well the submitted artifacts support the work described in the accepted papers. Participation in Artifact Evaluation is voluntary and has no influence on the paper’s acceptance, but is strongly encouraged. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive badges printed on the papers themselves. Additional details on the Artifact Evaluation process can be found here. 
 
 Submission Instructions 

 All paper submissions will be handled electronically at the MobiCom ’23 paper submission website  . Authors should prepare a PDF version of their full paper. All submitted papers will be evaluated through a double-blind  reviewing process, with the identities of the authors withheld from the reviewers. 
 
 Before final submission, you are expected to make sure that your paper complies with the following requirements. Please do not violate these requirements with the aim of including additional material: ​submissions that violate the formatting requirements may not be reviewed​.  You can visually inspect a page-by-page report of your paper format using the same tool as the submission system via a separate ​ online form  . After the submission deadline, we will use the same tool to check the conformance of papers. The format checking tool uses heuristics and can make mistakes. The PC chairs will manually inspect and possibly reject those papers with evident format violations. However, no paper will be rejected due to format violations without being manually checked. 
 
 Any papers that do not adhere to the following guidelines may be immediately rejected:

 PANEL  

 Accelerator Interconnects   

 Nearly all the emerging, high-value applications, especially those residing on the edge, use accelerators rather than CPUs for their essential functions. Moreover, in a cluster of any size, including at the edge, multiple accelerators are employed to meet the dynamic demands of such applications. These accelerators can be of the same type, as a pool, or of different types. But as with the case of CPUs, the performance of the system is almost always limited by the I/O or interconnect. Therefore, we want to explore how the interconnections of accelerators not only avoid being the bottleneck but more importantly make it possible for the accelerators to work in concert to enable new applications and revolutionize the architecture of computing. This panel will explore the most innovative approaches to accelerator interconnects to take fullest advantage of the capability of these amazing accelerators.

 Overview and Call for Papers  

 The 64th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS 2023), sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Mathematical Foundations of Computing, will be held in  Santa Cruz, CA, USA November 6—November 9, 2023  at the Hotel Paradox  .  Information about previous conferences can be found at the FOCS Conference Archive  .  
 Papers presenting new and original research on theory of computation are sought. Typical but not exclusive topics of interest include: algorithmic coding theory, algebraic computation, algorithmic graph theory, algorithms and data structures, analysis of Boolean functions, approximation algorithms, computational applications of logic, combinatorics, computational complexity including communication complexity and circuit complexity, computational game theory, computational geometry, computational learning theory, cryptography, foundations of machine learning, online algorithms, optimization, parallel and distributed algorithms, parameterized algorithms, sublinear algorithms, streaming algorithms, quantum computing, randomness in computing, and theoretical aspects of areas such as networks, privacy, information retrieval, computational biology, and databases. Papers that broaden the reach of the theory of computing, or raise important problems that can benefit from theoretical investigation and analysis, are encouraged.   
 Please submit using this link: https://focs23.hotcrp.com/   

 Important dates  

 Abstract submission deadline | March 28, 2023 at 16:59 PDT 
 Full paper submission deadline | April 3, 2023 at 16:59 PDT 
 Notification | July 1, 2023 
 Conference | November 6 — November 9, 2023 

 Submission format  

 Abstracts, to be submitted by the abstract submission deadline, should consist of the title of the paper, and a brief abstract summarizing the paper’s contributions. Full submissions, submitted by the full paper submission deadline, should contain the complete paper. There is no page limit and authors are encouraged to use the “full version” of their paper as the submission. The submission should contain within the initial ten pages following the title page a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper’s importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. The submission should be addressed to a broad spectrum of theoretical computer science researchers. Proofs must be provided which can enable the main mathematical claims of the paper to be fully verified. Although there is no bound on the length of a submission, material other than the abstract, references, and the first ten pages will be read at the committee’s discretion. Authors are encouraged to put the references at the very end of the submission. The submission should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts, in a single-column, single-space (between lines) format with ample spacing throughout and 1-inch margins all around, on letter-size (8 1/2 x 11 inch) paper. Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.   
 FOCS 2023 will use double-blind reviewing  , and as such, submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should not include obvious references that reveal their own identity, and should ensure that any references to their own related work are in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”).   
 The purpose of this double-blind process is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, and not to make it impossible for them to discover who the authors are if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas.   
 Submissions by PC members are allowed. If any of the authors of a submission is a PC member, this should be indicated in the submission form by checking the corresponding box.   

 Conjecture track  

 Submissions to FOCS 2023 can be marked for the “Main Track” or the “Conjectures Track”. Submissions to the new Conjectures Track will be evaluated completely separately from submissions to the Main Track. There is no a priori acceptance quota for either track, or desired number of accepted papers: it will all depend on the quality of submissions only.   
 Papers submitted to the Conjectures Track should be focused on one or more conjectures, describe evidence for and against them, and motivate them through potential implications. The conjecture(s) can be novel to the paper, or they can be conjectures that have been formed in the past within a certain community. In the latter case, the origin of the conjecture(s) should be described in the submission: it is not required that authors of the paper are also at the origin of the conjecture(s), but if they are not, they should attribute them appropriately to the extent possible.   
 Papers submitted to the Conjectures Track will be evaluated based on the importance of the conjecture(s) to the relevant field within theoretical computer science and beyond, as argued in the submission. Evidence for the conjecture(s) and implications of the conjecture(s) should be provided to support this importance. Of course, conjectures that may open up a new field within theoretical computer science would also be very welcome.   
 FAQ on the conjecture track    

 Submission instructions  

 Authors are required to submit their papers electronically, in PDF (without security restrictions on copying or printing).   
 Please submit using this link: https://focs23.hotcrp.com/   
 The submission process will include a declaration of conflicts of interest, to help manage the double-blind review process. This information can only be seen by the program committee chair and thus cannot be used by the rest of the program committee to deanonymize authors. Please only include conflicts of interest as defined by SafeToC  :  
   
 Family member or close friend. 
  Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years. 
  Person with the same affiliation. 
  Person involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.) 
  Reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter). 
  Frequent or recent collaborator (within the last 2 years) whom you believe cannot objectively review your work. 
    
 If an author believes that they have a valid reason for a conflict of interest not listed above, then he or she can contact the PC chair or any ToC advocate affiliated with this conference directly. Note that if the program chair has reason to doubt the validity of the claim of conflict of interest, then they may request that a ToC advocate confidentially verify the reason for the conflict. If authors are uncertain, they are encouraged to email the PC chair or a ToC advocate. The submission software asks for conflicts with PC members, and in addition contains a text form in which one can declare additional conflicts.   
 Authors are encouraged to also make full versions of their submissions freely accessible in an online repository such as the  arXiv   ,  ECCC   , or the  Cryptology ePrint archive   . (Papers that are not written well enough for public dissemination are probably also not ready for submission to FOCS.) It is expected that authors of accepted papers will make their full papers, with proofs, publicly available by the camera-ready deadline.

 The conference will follow SIGACT’s policy on prior publication and simultaneous submissions. Work that has been previously published in another conference proceedings or journal, or which is scheduled for publication prior to December 2023, will not be considered for acceptance at FOCS 2023. Simultaneous submission of the same (or essentially the same) abstract to FOCS 2023 and to another conference with published proceedings or journal is not allowed. The program committee may interact with program chairs of other (past or future) conferences to find out about closely related submissions. Notwithstanding the above, works that were previously published or announced in another journal or conference with a significantly different format, content, and audience than FOCS might still be considered at the PC’s discretion; in such cases authors should contact the program chair prior to submission.   

 Machtey Awards  

 The Machtey award will be given to the best paper or papers written solely by one or more students. An abstract is eligible if all authors are full-time students at the time of submission. This should be indicated at the time of submission. All submissions are eligible for the Best Paper award. The committee may decide to split the awards between multiple papers, or to decline to make an award.   

 Presentation of accepted papers  

 One author of each accepted paper will be expected to present the work at the conference. Authors are expected to contact the program chair before submission in case insufficient travel funds, family circumstances or external travel restrictions could prevent them from attending the conference.

The LICS  Symposium is an annual international forum on theoretical and practical topics in computer science that relate to logic, broadly construed. We invite submissions on topics that fit under that rubric. Suggested, but not exclusive, topics of interest include:  
 automata theory, automated deduction, categorical models and logics, concurrency and distributed computation, constraint programming, constructive mathematics, database theory, decision procedures, description logics, domain theory finite model theory, formal aspects of program analysis, formal methods, foundations of computability, foundations of probabilistic, real-time and hybrid systems, games and logic, higher-order logic, knowledge representation and reasoning, lambda and combinatory calculi, linear logic, logic programming logical aspects of AI logical aspects of bioinformatics, logical aspects of computational complexity, logical aspects of quantum computation logical frameworks, logics of programs, modal and temporal logics, model checking, process calculi, programming language semantics, proof theory, reasoning about security and privacy, rewriting, type systems, type theory, and verification.  

 Instructions to Authors  
 Authors are required to submit a paper title and a short abstract of about 100 words in advance of submitting the full paper. The exact deadline time on these dates is given by anywhere on earth   (AoE).  

 Titles and Short Abstracts Due | 18 January 2023 
 Full Papers Due | 23 January 2023 
 Author Response Period | 15–19 March 2023 
 Author Notification | 5 April 2023 
 Conference | 26 – 29 June 2023 

 Submission deadlines are firm; late submissions will not be considered. All submissions will be electronic via https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lics23   .  
 Formatting instructions:  Every full paper must be submitted in the IEEE Proceedings 2-column 10pt format and may be at most 12 pages, excluding references. LaTeX style files are available here  ; please use IEEEtran.cls version V1.8b, released on 26/08/2015.  
 The paper must be in English and provide sufficient detail to allow the program committee to assess the merits of the paper. It should begin with a succinct statement of the issues a summary of the main results, and a brief explanation of their significance and relevance to the conference and to computer science, all phrased for the non-specialist. Technical development directed to the specialist should follow. References and comparisons with related work must be included. (If necessary detailed proofs of technical results may be included in a clearly-labeled appendix, to be consulted at the discretion of program committee members.) Submissions not conforming to the above requirements will be rejected without further consideration. Paper selection will be merit-based, with no a priori limit on the number of accepted papers. Papers authored or co-authored by members of the program committee are not allowed.  
 Results must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere, including the proceedings of other symposia or workshops. The program chair must be informed, in advance of submission, of any closely related work submitted or about to be submitted to a conference or journal. Authors of accepted papers are expected to sign copyright release forms. One author of each accepted paper is expected to register and present the paper at the conference. Remote presentations can be organized for authors who are not to be able to attend the meeting.  
 LICS 2023 will use a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Following this process means that reviewers will not see the authors' names or affiliations as they initially review a paper. The authors' names will then be revealed to the reviewers only once their reviews have been submitted.  
 To facilitate this process, submitted papers must adhere to the following:  
 Author names and institutions must be omitted and 
  References to the authors' own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not "We build on our previous work ..." but rather "We build on the work of ..."). 
  The purpose of this process is to help the reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission, makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult, or interferes with the process of disseminating new ideas. For example, important background references should not be omitted or anonymized, even if they are written by the same authors and share common ideas, techniques, or infrastructure. Authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas.  
 Kleene Award, Distinguished Papers and Special Issues  
 An award in honor of the late Stephen C. Kleene will be given for the best student paper(s), as judged by the program committee.  
 Around 10% of accepted papers will be selected as distinguished papers. These are papers that, in the view of the LICS program committee, make exceptionally strong contribution to the field and should be read by a broad audience due their relevance, originality, significance and clarity.  
 Full versions of up to three accepted papers, to be selected by the program committee, will be invited for submission to the Journal of the ACM. Additional selected papers will be invited to a special issue of Logical Methods in Computer Science.  
 Publication  
 The official publication date may differ from the first day of the conference. The official publication date may affect the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. We will clarify the official publication date in due course.

 Welcome to VL/HCC 2023!  
   
 From the beginning of the computer age, people have sought easier ways to learn, express, and understand computational ideas. Whether this meant moving from punch cards to textual languages, or command lines to graphical UIs, the quest to make computation easier to express, manipulate, and understand by a broader group of people is an ongoing challenge.  
 The IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing  is the premier international forum for research on this topic. Established in 1984, the mission of the conference is to support the design, theory, application, and evaluation of computing technologies and languages for programming, modeling, and communicating, which are easier to learn, use, and understand by people.  
 The 2023 symposium is scheduled to take place October 3-6 in Washington, DC, USA. VL/HCC 2023 is 100% Sponsored by IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Multimedia Computing (TCMC).  
 VL/HCC is indexed in Scopus, DBLP, IEEE Explore, WoS.

 IEEE VIS: Visualization & Visual Analytics   
 Melbourne, Australia, 22-27 October    

 Welcome to IEEE VIS 2023!  
   
 G’day!  
 IEEE VIS is headed to Australia in 2023—the first time VIS is being held in the Southern Hemisphere.  
 The face-to-face conference will be held at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre, on the banks of the Birrarung (Yarra River), in the heart of the City of Melbourne. We acknowledge Traditional Owners of Narrm, the Boon Wurrung and Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung people of the Kulin nation, on whose land VIS 2023 will be held. We pay our respects to their Elders past, present and emerging.  
 VIS 2023 will be the year’s premier forum for advances in theory, methods, and applications of visualization and visual analytics. The conference will convene an international community of researchers and practitioners from universities, government, and industry to exchange recent findings on the design and use of visualization tools.  
 We invite you to share your research, insights, and enthusiasm at IEEE VIS. As usual, the 2023 program will also feature a diverse range of symposia and co-located events.

 MAY 22-25, 2023 AT THE HYATT REGENCY SAN FRANCISCO, CA & ONLINE  
 44th IEEE Symposium on  
  Security and Privacy  
 Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy  in cooperation with the International Association for Cryptologic Research   

 Call For Papers  
  Since 1980 in Oakland, the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy has been the premier forum for computer security research, presenting the latest developments and bringing together researchers and practitioners. We solicit previously unpublished papers offering novel research contributions in any aspect of security or privacy. Papers may present advances in the theory, design, implementation, analysis, verification, or empirical evaluation and measurement of secure systems. Theoretical papers must make a convincing case for the relevance of their results to practice.  
 Topics of interest include:  
 Applied cryptography 
  Attacks with novel insights, techniques, or results 
  Authentication, access control, and authorization 
  Blockchains and distributed ledger security 
  Cloud computing security 
  Cyber physical systems security 
  Distributed systems security 
  Economics of security and privacy 
  Embedded systems security 
  Formal methods and verification 
  Hardware security 
  Hate, Harassment, and Online Abuse 
  Intrusion detection and prevention 
  Machine learning and computer security 
  Malware and unwanted software 
  Network security 
  Operating systems security 
  Privacy-enhancing technologies, anonymity, and censorship 
  Program and binary analysis 
  Protocol security 
  Security and privacy metrics 
  Security and privacy policies 
  Security architectures 
  Security foundations 
  Systems security 
  Usable security and privacy 
  Web security 
  Wireless and mobile security/privacy 
  This topic list is not meant to be exhaustive; S&P is interested in all aspects of computer security and privacy. Papers without a clear application to security or privacy, however, will be considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review.  
 Systematization of Knowledge Papers  
 As in past years, we solicit systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge, as such papers can provide a high value to our community. Suitable papers are those that provide an important new viewpoint on an established, major research area, support or challenge long-held beliefs in such an area with compelling evidence, or present a convincing, comprehensive new taxonomy of such an area. Survey papers without such insights are not appropriate and may be rejected without full review. Submissions will be distinguished by the prefix “SoK:” in the title and a checkbox on the submission form. They will be reviewed by the full PC and held to the same standards as traditional research papers, but they will be accepted based on their treatment of existing work and value to the community, and not based on any new research results they may contain. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings. You can find an overview of recent SoK papers at https://oaklandsok.github.io/  .  
 Submission Deadlines & Decisions  
 Based on the experience in the past three years, the reviewing process for IEEE S&P is changed to three submission deadlines. For each submission, one of the following decisions will be made:  
 Accept  : Papers in this category will be accepted for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference. Within one month of acceptance, all accepted papers must submit a camera-ready copy incorporating reviewer feedback. The papers will immediately be published, open access, in the Computer Society’s Digital Library, and they may be cited as “To appear in the IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy, May 2023”. 
  Conditional accept  : These papers should be accepted, but with shepherding to check that some minor revisions requested by reviewers are made. Minor revisions typically are editorial changes that are relatively straightforward for authors to execute in the time between decisions and the camera-ready deadline. Minor revisions generally should not require new experiments or analyses that have a reasonable likelihood of failure. 
  Major Revision  : A limited number of papers will be invited to submit a major revision; such papers will receive a specific set of expectations to be met by that revision. Authors can submit a revised paper to the next two submission deadlines after the notification. The authors should clearly explain in a well-marked appendix how the revisions address the comments of the reviewers. The revised paper will then be re-evaluated, and either accepted or rejected. We will try to assign the same set of reviewers. 
  Reject  : Papers in this category are declined for inclusion in the conference. Rejected papers must wait for one year, from the date of original submission, to resubmit to IEEE S&P. A paper will be judged to be a resubmit (as opposed to a new submission) if the paper is from the same or similar authors, and a reviewer could write a substantially similar summary of the paper compared with the original submission. As a rule of thumb, if there is more than 40% overlap between the original submission and the new paper, it will be considered a resubmission. 
  All papers accepted by March 10, 2023 will appear in the proceedings of the symposium in May 2023 and invited to present their work. These include for example papers that were submitted in December 2022 and were accepted without revision, or papers that were submitted in April 2022, got the Major Revision decision, and resubmitted the revised paper in August or December.  
 Important Dates  
 All deadlines are 23:59:59 AoE (UTC-12).

  Rebuttal Period  
 We will introduce a rebuttal period during which authors have the opportunity to exchange messages with the reviewers and respond to questions asked. To this end, we will use HotCRP’s anonymous communication feature to enable a communication channel between authors and reviewers. The authors should mainly focus on factual errors in the reviews and concrete questions posed by the reviewers. New research results can also be discussed if they help to clarify open questions. More instructions will be sent out to the authors at the beginning of the rebuttal period.  
 Major Revision Submissions & Rejected Papers  
 As described above, some number of papers will receive a Major Revision decision, rather than Accept, Conditional Accept, or Reject. This decision will be accompanied by a detailed summary of the expectations for the revision, in addition to the standard reviewer comments. The authors may prepare a major revision, which may include running additional experiments, improving the paper’s presentation, or other such improvements. Papers meeting the expectations will typically be accepted. Those that do not will be rejected. Only in exceptional circumstances will additional revisions be requested. Authors can submit a revised paper to the next two submission deadlines after the notification. Upon receiving a Major Revision decision, authors can choose to withdraw their paper or not submit a revision, but they will be asked to not submit the same or similar work again (following the same rules as for Rejected papers) for 1 year from the date of the original submission. The table below summarizes the eligible 2022 deadlines for papers that received a revise decision or reject decision for a paper submitted to IEEE S&P’22 for each of the three 2022 cycles.

  Instructions for Paper Submission  
 These instructions apply to both the research papers and systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers. All submissions must be original work; the submitter must clearly document any overlap with previously published or simultaneously submitted papers from any of the authors. Failure to point out and explain overlap will be grounds for rejection. Simultaneous submission of the same paper to another venue with proceedings or a journal is not allowed and will be grounds for automatic rejection. Contact the program committee chairs if there are questions about this policy.  
 Anonymous Submission  
 Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review: no author names or affiliations may appear on the title page, and papers should avoid revealing authors’ identity in the text. When referring to their previous work, authors are required to cite their papers in the third person, without identifying themselves. In the unusual case in which a third-person reference is infeasible, authors can blind the reference itself. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review. PC members who have a genuine conflict of interest with a paper, including the PC Co-Chairs and the Associate Chairs, will be excluded from evaluation and discussion of that paper.  
 While a paper is under submission to the IEEE Security & Privacy Symposium, authors may choose to give talks about their work, post a preprint of the paper to an archival repository such as arXiv, and disclose security vulnerabilities to vendors. Authors should refrain from widely advertising their results, but in special circumstances they should contact the PC chairs to discuss exceptions. Authors are not allowed to directly contact PC members to discuss their submission.  
 The submissions will be treated confidentially by the PC chairs and the program committee members. Program committee members are not allowed to share the submitted papers with anyone, with the exception of qualified external reviewers approved by the program committee chairs. Please contact the PC chairs if you have any questions or concerns.  
 Conflicts of Interest  
 During submission of a research paper, the submission site will request information about conflicts of interest of the paper's authors with program committee (PC) members. It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all and only their potential conflict-of-interest PC members, according to the following definition. A paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member when and only when one or more of the following conditions holds:  
 The PC member is a co-author of the paper. 
  The PC member has been a co-worker in the same company or university within the past two years. | For student interns, the student is conflicted with their supervisors and with members of the same research group. If the student no longer works for the organization, then they are not conflicted with a PC member from the larger organization. 
  The PC member has been a collaborator within the past two years. 
  The PC member is or was the author's primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago. 
  The author is or was the PC member's primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago. 
  The PC member is a relative or close personal friend of the author. 
  For any other situation where the authors feel they have a conflict with a PC member, they must explain the nature of the conflict to the PC chairs, who will mark the conflict if appropriate. The program chairs will review declared conflicts. Papers with incorrect or incomplete conflict of interest information as of the submission closing time are subject to immediate rejection.  
 Research Ethics Committee  
 New to Oakland 2023 is a research ethics committee (REC) that will check papers flagged by reviewers as potentially including ethically fraught research. The REC will review flagged papers and may suggest to the PC Chairs rejection of a paper on ethical grounds. The REC consists of members of the PC. Authors are encouraged to review the Menlo Report  for general ethical guidelines for computer and information security research.  
 Ethical Considerations for Vulnerability Disclosure  
 Where research identifies a vulnerability (e.g., software vulnerabilities in a given program, design weaknesses in a hardware system, or any other kind of vulnerability in deployed systems), we expect that researchers act in a way that avoids gratuitous harm to affected users and, where possible, affirmatively protects those users. In nearly every case, disclosing the vulnerability to vendors of affected systems, and other stakeholders, will help protect users. It is the committee’s sense that a disclosure window of 45 days https://vuls.cert.org/confluence/display/Wiki/Vulnerability+Disclosure+Policy  to 90 days https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/p/vulnerability-disclosure-faq.html  ahead of publication is consistent with authors’ ethical obligations.  
 Longer disclosure windows (which may keep vulnerabilities from the public for extended periods of time) should only be considered in exceptional situations, e.g., if the affected parties have provided convincing evidence the vulnerabilities were previously unknown and the full rollout of mitigations requires additional time. The authors are encouraged to consult with the PC chairs in case of questions or concerns.  
 The version of the paper submitted for review must discuss in detail the steps the authors have taken or plan to take to address these vulnerabilities; but, consistent with the timelines above, the authors do not have to disclose vulnerabilities ahead of submission. If a paper raises significant ethical and/or legal concerns, it will be checked by the REC and it might be rejected based on these concerns. The PC chairs will be happy to consult with authors about how this policy applies to their submissions.  
 Ethical Considerations for Human Subjects Research  
 Submissions that describe experiments that could be viewed as involving human subjects, that analyze data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), or that otherwise may put humans at risk should:  
 Disclose whether the research received an approval or waiver from each of the authors' institutional ethics review boards (IRB) if applicable. 
  Discuss steps taken to ensure that participants and others who might have been affected by an experiment were treated ethically and with respect. 
  If a submission deals with any kind of personal identifiable information (PII) or other kinds of sensitive data, the version of the paper submitted for review must discuss in detail the steps the authors have taken to mitigate harms to the persons identified. If a paper raises significant ethical and/or legal concerns, it will be checked by the REC and it might be rejected based on these concerns. The PC chairs will be happy to consult with authors about how this policy applies to their submissions.  
 Financial and Non-financial competing interests  
 In the interests of transparency and to help readers form their own judgements of potential bias, the IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy requires authors and PC members to declare any competing financial and/or non-financial interests in relation to the work described. Authors need to include a disclosure of relevant financial interests in the camera-ready versions of their papers. This includes not just the standard funding lines, but should also include disclosures of any financial interest related to the research described. For example, "Author X is on the Technical Advisory Board of the ByteCoin Foundation,"  or "Professor Y is the CTO of DoubleDefense, which specializes in malware analysis."  More information regarding this policy is available here  .  
 Reviews from Prior Submissions  
 For papers that were previously submitted to, and rejected from, another conference, authors are required to submit a separate document containing the prior reviews along with a description of how those reviews were addressed in the current version of the paper. Authors are only required to include reviews from the last time the paper was submitted. Reviewers will only see the provided supplementary material after finishing their own review to avoid being biased in formulating their own opinions; once their reviews are complete, however, reviewers will be given the opportunity to provide additional comments based on the submission history of the paper. Authors who try to circumvent this rule (e.g., by changing the title of the paper without significantly changing the contents) may have their papers rejected without further consideration, at the discretion of the PC chairs.  
 Page Limit and Formatting  
 Submitted papers may include up to 13 pages of text and up to 5 pages for references and appendices, totaling no more than 18 pages. The same applies to camera-ready papers, although, at the PC chairs’ discretion, additional pages may be allowed for references and appendices. Reviewers are not required to read appendices.  
 Papers must be formatted for US letter (not A4) size paper. The text must be formatted in a two-column layout, with columns no more than 9.5 in. tall and 3.5 in. wide. The text must be in Times font, 10-point or larger, with 11-point or larger line spacing.  
 Authors may use the IEEE conference proceedings templates. LaTeX submissions using the IEEE templates should use IEEEtran.cls version 1.8b with options “conference,compsoc.” (That is, begin your LaTeX document with the line \documentclass[conference,compsoc]{IEEEtran}.)  
 Whether or not a submission uses the IEEE templates, the authors alone are responsible for ensuring that their paper complies with the formatting guidelines above (column size, margins, font size, line spacing etc.). All submissions will be automatically checked for conformance to these requirements. Failure to adhere to the page limit and formatting requirements are grounds for rejection without review.  
 Conference Submission Server  
 Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf). Authors should pay special attention to unusual fonts, images, and figures that might create problems for reviewers.  
 Papers for the first cycle must be submitted at: | https://hotcrp.sp2023.ieee-security.org | . 
  Papers for the second cycle must be submitted at: | https://hotcrp2.sp2023.ieee-security.org | . 
  Papers for the third cycle must be submitted at: | https://hotcrp3.sp2023.ieee-security.org | . 
  Publication and Presentation  
 Authors are responsible for obtaining appropriate publication clearances. One of the authors of the accepted paper is expected to present the paper at the conference.

  CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS   

 We invite workshop proposals for the 2023 IEEE Winter Conference of Applications on Computer Vision (WACV 2023). WACV 2023 is planned as an in-person conference with associated in-person workshops in Waikoloa, Hawaii, January 3-7, 2023. However, proposals for purely virtual workshops will also be considered.  
 The workshop proposals should focus on topics related to computer vision and its applications, interdisciplinary themes with other scientific and application areas, as well as emerging challenges or competitions. The format, style, and content of accepted workshops are under the control of the workshop organizers and largely autonomous from the main conference. Workshop organizers are expected to manage their technical programs, invite experts in the domain, and maintain a website for the workshop. Workshop registration and logistics will be handled by the main conference.  
 We encourage workshop proposals aimed at creating or strengthening communities.  
 Accepted workshops will be held on either 3 January 2023 or 7 January 2023. The workshop paper submission, review, acceptance notification, and final manuscript submission should all be handled between 10 October 2022 (tentative deadline for submission of workshop papers) and 19 November 2022 (firm camera-ready workshop paper due date).  
 Conference website: https://wacv2023.thecvf.com/   
  
 Submission Instructions   
 Proposals should clearly specify/discuss the following:  
 Workshop title, topic and tentative call for papers 
  Motivation, impact, and expected outcomes 
  Brief bios of organizers (including email and web pages) 
  Tentative program committee 
  Format (select either half or full day) and preliminary schedule 
  Type of workshop, i.e., in-person or virtual (the latter requires a short justification) 
  Tentative invited speakers 
  Estimated number of submissions and attendees 
  Plans (if any) for a special journal issue or book 
  Social impact of the workshop 
   
 Workshop proposals should be submitted in the form of a single PDF through CMT: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/WACVworkshops2023  .  
 Proposals will be evaluated by the workshop chairs and conference organizers, with an eye towards selecting high-quality workshops on a diverse set of topics that will inform and inspire the community.  
  
 Diversity, equity and inclusion   
 We especially encourage proposals involving diverse organizing teams and communities currently under-represented at WACV. We also welcome workshop topics that address issues in Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Computer Vision applications.

 Research Engineer in Synthetic Data Generation and Augmentation (f/m/div.)   
 Bosch Center for AI  |  Germany, Stuttgart Area    
 We conduct research on state-of-the-art deep generative models that are used to enable real-world Bosch systems to be data-efficient. We are looking for a research engineer to support us both in academic research activities and in transferring those results to real-world systems.  
 The goal of this position is to develop new learning algorithms for generating better training datasets, making algorithms robust, reliable, and safe when learning even from limited/biased datasets. In particular, the focus is on the use of generative models for data augmentation: generation of synthetic data using both computer graphics and image-synthesis with generative models (i.e., GANs, diffusion models, neural rendering), as well as techniques for domain transfer.

 Welcome to ASONAM 2023  

  The photos from ASONAM 2023 are avaiable here     

  Good news: ASONAM has been included in CORE     

  For more than a century, social networks have been studied in a variety of disciplines including sociology, anthropology, psychology, and economics. The Internet, the social Web, and other large-scale, socio-technological infrastructures have triggered a growing interest and significant methodological advancements in social network analysis and mining. Method development in graph theory, statistics, data mining and machine learning, and statistical mechanics is inspired by new research problems and, in turn, opens up further possibilities for application. These spiraling trends have led to a rising prominence of social network analysis and mining methods and tools in academia, politics, security, and business.  
  The international conference series on Advances in Social Network Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2023) provides an interdisciplinary venue that brings together researchers and practitioners from a broad variety of fields to promote collaborations and exchange of ideas and practices. ASONAM 2023 is intended to address important aspects with a specific focus on emerging trends and industry needs. The conference solicits empirical, experimental, methodological, and theoretical research reporting original and unpublished results on social network analysis and mining along with applications.

  | Special Focus on Social Networks in Africa  ASONAM 2023 will be held in Morocco, and will have a special focus on social media and social networks in Africa: for example, analysis on African commerce, transportation, health, languages and other social networks. This is the first time this conference will be held in Africa, and we are especially interested in submissions that produce and/or engage with datasets from the continent that can support research and learning in service of Africans.  
 To fully embrace the fast-growing and vigorously dynamic trend of social network approaches and applications, ASONAM 2023 is eager to consider any breakthroughs in social network analysis and mining in the broadest possible sense.  
 General areas of interest to ASONAM 2023 include information science and mathematics, communication studies, business and organizational studies, sociology, psychology, anthropology, applied linguistics, biology and medicine.  
  
  | Review Criteria  The papers will be reviewed and assessed by the program committee. Full paper manuscripts must be in English with a maximum length of 8 pages using the IEEE two-column template. We also solicit short papers with a maximum length of 4 pages. Submissions should include the title, author(s), affiliation(s), e-mail address(es), and abstract on the first page.  
 Papers will be accepted to the conference based on the reviewers' comments on their impact, originality, timeliness, relevance, and clarity of presentation. A Best Paper Award ceremony will be organized at the banquet. If the paper is accepted, the paper will appear in the proceedings of the conference if one author presents the paper at the conference and at least one author registers as a full conference participant.  
  
  | Authors Commit To Reviewing  By submitting to the conference, each author volunteers to be entered into the pool of potential PC members/reviewers for ASONAM 2023 and may be asked to review papers for the conference. This does not apply to authors who have already agreed to contribute to ASONAM 2023 in some capacity (e.g., as PC/SPC members of the main conference or special tracks, area chairs, or members of the organizing committee) and authors who are not qualified to be ASONAM PC members (e.g., undergraduate students, junior graduate students, researchers with a limited track record). This requirement may be waived in a limited range of exceptional circumstances (researchers leaving academia, parental leave, etc.)  
  
  | No Concurrent Submissions  Submitted papers must describe work that is substantively different from work that has already been published, or accepted for publication in an archival venue. ASONAM submissions must not be in concurrent submission to any archival conference or journal during the ASONAM review period. Note that papers previously uploaded to a pre-print server like arXiv but not published are acceptable as submissions to ASONAM. Submitted papers may also be uploaded to pre-print servers if desired by the authors.  
  
  | | Authorship  Every person named as the author of a paper must have contributed substantially to the work described in the paper and/or to the writing of the paper. Every listed author must take responsibility for the entire content of a paper. Persons who do not meet these requirements may be acknowledged, but should not be listed as authors. Post-submission changes to the set of authors list are not allowed. Authorship may not be modified after the paper submission deadline.  
  
  | Publications  Accepted and presented papers will be included in the Conference Proceedings and forwarded for inclusion in IEEE Computer Society Digital Library (CSDL), IEEE eXplore, and the ACM Digital Library. The conference proceedings will be submitted for El indexing through INSPEC by the IEEE. Proceedings will be included in several indexes, e.g., Web of Science, SCOPUS, etc.

 CALL FOR INDUSTRIAL PAPERS - FULL - SHORT  

 Submit Article     
  
  Social network analysis and mining techniques are central to numerous modern industrial settings. Such techniques often push forward existing frontiers in sectors such as user modeling, personalization, and behavioral understanding. Industrial research in such areas is rapidly growing and further spurring the development of exciting ideas.  
 The ASONAM 2023 Industrial Track seeks submissions in all categories (8-page full papers, 4-page short papers, and 2-page extended abstracts) which showcase recent research advances in social network analysis and mining with direct industrial relevance. The track offers a venue for industrial practitioners and academic researchers to discuss emerging trends and practical challenges, and serves to further facilitate interactions between academia and industry in this vital area of growing interest.  
 All papers submitted to the ASONAM 2023 Industrial Track will undergo a standard peer-review process. The track emphasizes focus on contributions of industrial innovation and relevance, observational findings, interesting lessons learned in practice, and new classes of applications which can inspire further academic work. In-progress work is also considered. Contributions from both industrial research/development groups (both public and private sector) and academics are welcome.  
 In addition to regular presentation-based industrial track sessions, the track will include both an Industrial Poster Session and an Industrial Demo Session to encourage further exchange of ideas between academic and industrial researchers and practitioners. Depending on the availability of presentation slots, a fraction of accepted Industrial Track papers may be scheduled for poster-presentation only. Industrial Track contributors that plan to give a poster presentation or show a demo, but do not have a full or short paper submission, are requested to submit a 2-page extended abstract, which will be reviewed and (if accepted) be included in the conference proceedings. For authors planning to show a demo, a document describing the demo and associated requirements will be solicited after acceptance. Likewise, authors of contributions selected for poster presentation will be required to produce a poster for display at the venue.  
 We welcome submissions on the following, but not exclusive, topics:  
 - Mining data from industrial products or behavioral traces 
  - New data-driven industrial applications and services 
  - Methodologies and frameworks for analyzing data from industrial products 
  - Security and privacy issues in mining and analyzing user data 
  - Consumer-driven data analytics 
  - Modeling human behavior from social platforms 
  - Personalization and recommendation 
  - Network science 
  - Usage studies of social media 
   
  Papers will be accepted for the industrial track based on the reviewers' comments on their originality, timeliness, significance, relevance, and clarity of presentation. Accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of the conference if one author presents the paper at the conference and at least one author registers as a full conference participant.  
 | Publications  Accepted and presented papers will be included in the Conference Proceedings and forwarded for inclusion in IEEE Computer Society Digital Library (CSDL), IEEE eXplore, and the ACM Digital Library. The conference proceedings will be submitted for El indexing through INSPEC by the IEEE. Proceedings will be included in several indexes, e.g., Web of Science, SCOPUS, etc.

 What is ISMAR?     
 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR) is a flagship conference (CORE 2021 A* rating) that explores the advances in research and commercial activities related to AR, MR, and Virtual Reality (VR). ISMAR is setting new standards and trends with wide-ranging, creative, innovative, and highly technical content (see example 2021 program at  https://ismar21.org/program/  )    

 Where is ISMAR?    
 ISMAR 2023 (  https://ismar23.org  ) will be hosted in Sydney, Australia from 16 to 20 October, 2023, and is planned as a hybrid (physical + online) event. A renowned business destination in the Asia-Pacific region, Sydney is a beacon for leaders, thinkers and innovators from around the world. Boasting a stunning harbour skyline, rich and diverse cultural heritage, and prominent landmarks, the city is bursting with distinctive character.

 On behalf of the Organizing Committee, we extend you a warm welcome to the 53rd Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2023), organized by the University of Coimbra, Portugal. Over the years DSN has become a forum to present the best world research in the fusion between dependability and security research, understanding the need to simultaneously fight against accidental faults, intentional cyber-attacks, design errors, and unexpected operating conditions. We are looking forward to a conference filled with ideas from industry and academia.  
   
  DSN 2023 will be held in Porto, Portugal, June 27-30. Porto is a vibrant city in the north of Portugal, the home of many high-tech companies that ship software products worldwide. Porto is a fascinating destination that you should not miss! From Porto you can easily reach many other fantastic places in Portugal. By train, bus, or car one can get to Coimbra, Lisbon, and many small villages in the interior of the country, where the food, the people and the landscape will surprise you and create memories for life.

 Embedded and ubiquitous computing is a paradigm that aims to provide computing and communication services to the end users all the time and everywhere. Embedded and ubiquitous computing systems are now invading every aspect of our daily life and aim to revolutionize our life much more profoundly than the electric motors or even personal computer revolution did. The emergence of this technology is the outcome of research and technological advances in a variety of areas including embedded systems, pervasive computing and communications, wireless networks, mobile computing, distributed computing and agent technologies. Embedded and pervasive computing has become a key technology in determining future research and development activities in many academic and industrial branches.  
 Among a series of highly successful International Conferences on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing (EUC), the EUC 2023 conference is the 21st edition of a forum for engineers and scientists in academia, industry, and government to address the resulting profound challenges and to present and discuss their new ideas, research results, applications and experience on all aspects of embedded and ubiquitous computing. IEEE EUC-2023 is sponsored by IEEE, IEEE Computer Society, and IEEE Technical Committee on Scalable Computing (TCSC).  
 The 2023 Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing (EUC-2023) will provide a high-profile, leading-edge forum for researchers, engineers, and practitioners to present state-of-art advances and innovations in theoretical foundations, systems, infrastructure, tools, testbeds, and applications for the EUC, as well as to identify emerging research topics and define the future.  
 Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers to EUC-2023. All accepted papers are expected to be included in IEEE Xplore and will be indexed by Engineering Index (EI). IEEE Conference Publication Services (CPS) have confirmed all the papers accepted by TrustCom-2023 and the collocated conferences BigDataSE-2023, CSE-2023, EUC-2023, iSCI-2023 will be included in one conference proceeding and it will be indexed under TrustCom only. The authors of selected best papers will be invited post conference to extend their contributions for special issues of prestigious journals to be planned in conjunction with the conference.

 The 53rd Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks  
  
 On behalf of the Organizing Committee, we extend you a warm welcome to the 53rd Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2023), organized by the University of Coimbra, Portugal. Over the years DSN has become a forum to present the best world research in the fusion between dependability and security research, understanding the need to simultaneously fight against accidental faults, intentional cyber-attacks, design errors, and unexpected operating conditions. We are looking forward to a conference filled with ideas from industry and academia.  
   
  DSN 2023 will be held in Porto, Portugal, June 27-30. Porto is a vibrant city in the north of Portugal, the home of many high-tech companies that ship software products worldwide. Porto is a fascinating destination that you should not miss! From Porto you can easily reach many other fantastic places in Portugal. By train, bus, or car one can get to Coimbra, Lisbon, and many small villages in the interior of the country, where the food, the people and the landscape will surprise you and create memories for life.  

 Join us in Porto, Portugal, in June 2023.

 Welcome to IROS 2023  
 The Next Generation of Robotics  The 2023 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2023) will be held October 1 – 5, 2023 at Huntington Place   in Detroit, Michigan, USA.  
 IROS is a large and impactful forum for the international robotics research community to explore the frontier of science and technology in intelligent robots and smart machines, emphasizing future directions and the latest approaches, designs, and outcomes.  
 The theme of IROS 2023 is “The Next Generation of Robotics,” so the conference aims to particularly highlight the contributions of younger researchers and to help accelerate the future contributions of all those just entering the field. This will be reflected in plenary and keynote talks, workshops, tutorials, forums, competitions, exhibitions, tours, and technical sessions.  
   
 Welcome to Detroit  
 "Detroit's diverse culture has had both local and international influence, particularly in music, with the city giving rise to the genres of Motown and techno, and playing an important role in the development of jazz, hip-hop, rock, and punk. The rapid growth of Detroit in its boom years resulted in a globally unique stock of architectural monuments and historic places.  
 Since the 2000s, conservation efforts have managed to save many architectural pieces and achieved several large-scale revitalizations, including the restoration of several historic theatres and entertainment venues, high-rise renovations, new sports stadiums, and a riverfront revitalization project. An increasingly popular tourist destination, Detroit receives 16 million visitors per year." — Wikipedia

   About the Conference  
 The 2023 IEEE/WIC International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT'23) provides a premier international forum to bring together researchers and practitioners from diverse fields for presentation of original research results, as well as exchange and dissemination of innovative and practical development experiences on Web intelligence and intelligent agent technology research and applications.   
  
 The first international conference of Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT'01) was held in Maebashi Japan, 2001. Then, it followed by WI-IAT'03 in Halifax, Canada, WI-IAT'04 in Beijing, China, WI-IAT'05 in Compiegne, France, WI- IAT '06 in Hong Kong, WI-IAT'07 in Silicon Valley, USA, WI-IAT'08 in Sydney, Australia, WI-IAT'09 in Milano Italy, WI-IAT'10 in Toronto, Canada, WI-IAT'11 in Lyon, France, WI-IAT'12 in Macau, China, WI-IAT'13 in Atlanta, USA, WI-IAT'14 in Warsaw, Poland, and WI-IAT'15 in Singapore. The goal of WI-IAT conferences is to provide a global forum for scientists, engineers and educators to present the latest WI-IAT technologies discuss how to develop future intelligent systems for complex applications. After these years, in 2016, WI-IAT conferences have been merged as one brand (WI'16 in Omaha, USA, WI'17 in Leipzig, Germany, WI'18 in Santiago de Chile, and WI'19 in Thessaloniki, Greece) by redefining and vitalizing the WI aims and topics. In recognition of the strong connection of Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology, the classic brand of WI-IAT was resumed in 2020. After the great successful online WI-IAT'20, hybrid WI-IAT'21 and WI-IAT'22 during the global pandemic, WI-IAT'23 will be held in Venice, Italy, and once again, in the hybrid mode.   
  
 Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT) aims to achieve a multi-disciplinary balance between research advances in theories and methods usually associated with collective intelligence, data science, human-centric computing, knowledge management, network science, autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. It is committed to addressing research that both deepen the understanding of computational, logical, cognitive, physical, and social foundations of the future Web, and enable the development and application of intelligent technologies. WI-IAT'23 provides a premier forum and features high-quality, original research papers and real-world applications in all theoretical and technology areas that make up the field of Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology. WI-IAT'23 welcomes research, application as well as Industry/Demo paper submissions. Tutorial, Workshop and Special-Session proposals and papers are also welcome. WI-IAT'23 in Venice (Italy) is officially sponsored by IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Intelligent Informatics (TCII) and Web Intelligence Consortium (WIC).   
  
 WI-IAT'23 will provide a broad forum that academia professionals and industry people can exchange their ideas, findings and strategies in deepening the understanding of all Web's entities, phenomena, and developments in utilizing the power of human brains and man-made networks to create a better world. More specifically, the fields of how artificial intelligence is impacting the Web of People, the Web of Data, the Web of Things, the Web of Trust, the Web of Agents, the Web of Everything, and emerging FAccT in WI-IAT. Therefore, “Web Intelligence = AI in the Connected World”.

 Sunday, October 1st, Full-Day Workshops and Tutorials (8:30 am to 5:30 pm)  

 2nd Advanced Marine Robotics TC Workshop: Towards Long-term Marine Robotics     
   
 Organizers:  Francesco Maurelli, Huihuan (Alex) Qian, Nina Mahmoudian, Hyun-Taek Choi  
 Abstract:  For the development of the human society, there are extensive opportunities for robots to work long-term in the vast marine environment, e.g. for observation, transportation, environment protection, etc. Significant challenges exist as well, e.g. in autonomy, energy, communication, robustness, and so forth. To advocate the research for long-term marine robotics, this workshop will gather scholars in areas of robot design, perception, control, energy, planning, human-robot interaction, etc., to share their insights on how to enable marine robots to arrive at remote locations, explore for longer time, become more autonomous, overcome faults, perceive and so forth. Young researchers will also present their latest discoveries in workshop papers. Final discussions will enable speakers and audiences to interact and brainstorm how to enable marine robots for long-term functionalities. This workshop will provide a platform for marine robotic researchers at various career stages to exchange ideas so as to enable robots for long-term marine applications. It will also elaborate opportuities and challenges in marine robotics so as to inspire and attract researchers in other robotic fields to join the collaboration.

 3rd RL-CONFORM: Reinforcement Learning meets Human-Robot Interaction, Control, and Formal Methods     
   
 Organizers:  Christian Pek, Sanne van Waveren, Hang Yin  
 Abstract:  Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown remarkable achievements in applications ranging from autonomous driving, object manipulation, or beating best players in complex board games. However, elementary problems of RL remain open: exploratory and learned policies may cause unsafe situations, lack task-robustness, be unstable, or require many samples in the learning process. By satisfactorily addressing these problems, RL research will have long-lasting impact and see breakthroughs on real physical systems and in human-centered environments. Different communities have proposed multiple techniques to increase safety, transparency, and robustness of RL. The aim of this workshop is to provide a multidisciplinary platform to (1) jointly identify and clearly define major challenges in RL, (2) propose and debate existing approaches to ensure desired properties of learned policies from various perspectives, and (3) discuss opportunities to accelerate RL research. The themes of the workshop would comprise (but not be limited to) RL and control theory, RL and Human-Robot Interaction, RL and Formal Methods, benchmarking of RL, etc. In the tradition of our previous RL-CONFORM workshops, we encourage a fruitful and lively discussion between researchers that is open to anyone.

 Abstract:  The world around us is inherently “multi-agent”. When you drive your car, or walk through a crowd, you are engaging in a collaborative and/or competitive environment with other agents. This phenomenon makes the world an exciting place because it requires individuals to learn game-oriented strategies for all aspects of life which maximize our returns, whether it be longevity, wealth, or happiness. The environment is typically partially observable, necessitating decision making strategies which are capable of accounting for uncertainties in highly complex domains. In this workshop, we aim to explore these ideas by presenting the latest advancements in multi-agent reinforcement learning and game theory from top researchers and practitioners in the field. The workshop will cover a broad range of topics, including multi-robot coordination and communication, task allocation, resource management, planning, control, and game theory. Additionally, we encourage topics on algorithmic approaches for multi-task expertise and distillation. The workshop will include practical demonstrations and hands-on sessions to provide participants with the requisite tools to enable robots to interact in a highly complex, multi-agent world.

 Agricultural Robotics for a Sustainable Future     
   
 Organizers:  Naveen Kumar Uppalapati, Marija Popovic, Anand Kumar Mishra, Arun Narenthiran Sivakumar, Girish Chowdhary, Girish Krishnan, Robert Shepherd  
 Abstract:  Agriculture continues to face major challenges in feeding the growing population due to shrinking land availability and changing climate. Sustainable intensification is necessary to increase agricultural productivity without negative impacts on the environment. Robotics can help with this goal both as a platform for crop monitoring and as an enabler of automation in farms. However, this requires addressing challenging problems in robot design, perception, planning, and control. In addition, increased interdisciplinary collaborations between crop science, robotics, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are necessary to develop novel and affordable solutions for farmers. Our workshop aims to bring in leading researchers and entrepreneurs from multiple disciplines, like robotics, crop science, and agronomy, to discuss the state – of – the – art and key challenges to enable smart farming using robotics and AI-based agricultural technologies. We focus on three key themes: 1) Farm of the Future: Advancing Agriculture through Robotics, 2) Sustainable Agriculture through Collaboration: Role of Crop Scientists in Guiding Robotic Innovation, and 3 ) Commercializing Agricultural Robotics: Bridging the Gap Between Research and Industry for Sustainable Farming Solutions. The workshop will include talks and panel discussions on the above themes and a poster session for researchers in this area to present their work.

 Assembling Large Infrastructures in Space using Intelligent Robots     
   
 Organizers:  Craig Carignan, Mini C. Rai, Carol Martinez Luna, Giacomo Marani  
 Abstract:  Robotic in-space assembly utilizing in-situ resources will enable the construction of large-scale assets at a significantly reduced cost. High-value infrastructures requiring large-scale assembly include but are not limited to solar power satellite systems (SSPS), large-aperture space telescopes for continent-scale Earth and astronomical observations, orbiting laboratories, commercial platforms, and transportation hubs. Invariably, robotic technology for these complex missions will require a variety of locomotion and assembly capabilities beyond those currently employed in orbit onboard the International Space Station (ISS). Moreover, future assembly missions will likely involve multiple mobile space robots with manipulation and grasping capabilities that can collaborate and operate in semi to fully autonomous modes. This interdisciplinary workshop will bring together researchers from academia and practitioners from government, industry, and regulatory bodies to identify the frontiers of assembly missions, address barriers, formulate solutions, and share promising technologies for expediting challenging space missions. Notably, the workshop participants will explore the feasibility of employing intelligent sensing and planning technology for using robots for autonomous construction of large-scale high-value infrastructure will be examined. This workshop will feature invited talks by prominent speakers, panel townhall and poster/video presentations solicited from the community, emphasizing the importance of space sustainability and the vital roles to be played by autonomous robots made using next-generation technology.

 Closing the Loop on Localization: What Are We Localizing For, and How Does That Shape Everything We Should Do?     
   
 Organizers:  Luca Carlone, Margarita Chli, Tobias Fischer, Grace Gao, Sourav Garg, Stephen Hausler, Stephanie Lowry, Michael Milford, Amir Patel, Sebastian Scherer, Olga Vysotska, Peng Yin  
 Abstract:  Localization, Visual Place Recognition (VPR) and Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) techniques are never the end, but rather a means to enable higher-level tasks for robots. Major advances in localization capability have been made in the robotics, computer vision and machine learning fields, especially over the past two decades, with the advent of mature SLAM systems and modern machine-learning-driven approaches. Yet localization technology is still sparsely deployed in enduring large-scale commercial applications, and despite the adage that “SLAM is solved”, for many applied roboticists it is abundantly clear that there are substantial challenges to still overcome. Involving both researchers and end-users from industry, this workshop will focus on the key reasons we are developing localization and mapping systems, and use those insights to drive a reflection on the key methods by which we are approaching research. We will evaluate how we can improve the metrics and benchmarks by which we assess performance in the research field to make them better proxies of performance in actual deployed situations. To maximize inclusivity, we are providing substantial funding to support researchers from under-represented and lower socio-economic regions to attend and participate in the workshop, both in person and remotely.

 Developing Standard Testing and Reporting Guidelines for Soft Robotics     
   
 Organizers:  Robert Baines, Laura Blumenschein, Jennifer Case, Gina Olson, Andrew Spielberg  
 Abstract:  Soft roboticists are facing challenges with reproducibility, which prevents researchers from making holistic comparisons to prior work, impedes full understanding of results, and forces the need to “reinvent the wheel,” delaying fundamental advances. Reproducibility of results is key to advancing science as well as achieving technology transfer from research laboratories to industrial applications. The purpose of this workshop is to put forth a set of voluntary draft guidelines for soft roboticists concerning fabrication/manufacturing, test procedures, and reporting. Keynotes from members of academia, government, and industry will share difficulties they have encountered when trying to reproduce results from the soft robotics literature. The workshop will include breakout sessions moderated by the organizers and speakers to discuss relevant guidelines related to the topic of each keynote. We will synthesize the perspectives of all the breakout groups into a set of draft guidelines that we intend to publish. Collectively, we hope to improve the reporting standards of soft robotics and drive the field as a whole toward more rigorous research practices.

 Differentiable Probabilistic Robotics: Emerging Perspectives on Robot Learning     
   
 Organizers:  Jana Pavlasek, Anthony Opipari, Tom Power, Tucker Hermans, Fabio Ramos, Chad Jenkins  
 Abstract:  Advances in robot learning in recent years have yielded outstanding performance across robotic tasks, compelling roboticists to reexamine the role of long-standing, reliable probabilistic inference algorithms. Probabilistic methods have a long history of enabling effective operation under uncertain and unstructured environments and provide a unifying perspective on perception, control and learning. Robot learning, on the other hand, promises generalizability, eliminating the need for carefully hand-crafted models required in many classical probabilistic algorithms. However, it remains unclear whether we can achieve reliable, adaptable behavior by relying on data alone. This workshop sets out to address the question: How can roboticists achieve the best of both deep learning and probabilistic inference? Recently, the robotics community has seen an emergence of interest in hybrid methods which aim to exploit the benefits of both underlying model classes. Key developments in Differentiable Probabilistic Robotics have included the introduction of learned components within inference frameworks and end-to-end differentiable algorithms for Bayesian inference. These methods offer the opportunity to develop robust and reliable learning and adaptive systems. This workshop aims to connect researchers working at the intersection of robotics, deep learning, and probabilistic inference to facilitate breakthrough research in these areas.

 Formal methods techniques in robotics systems: Design and control     
   
 Organizers:  Abdalla Swikir, Fares Abu-Dakka, Sami Haddadin, Gitta Kutyniok, Wolfram Burgard, Majid Zamani, Necmiye Ozay  
 Abstract:  Formal methods are concerned with producing precise, unambiguous task specifications or constraints that systems are expected to satisfy. They allow us to design provably-correct controllers, which ensures that the behavior of an AI agent satisfies its formal specification, in a dynamic or stochastic environment. Examples of AI agents are robots. Since robotic systems are hybrid, complex, and sometimes safety-critical, satisfying their formal specification and verifying their closed-loop systems are uniquely challenging. Hence, using formal methods in designing and controlling life and mission-critical robotic systems is highly desirable and essential. Specifically, it allows for the early detection of errors in the robotic system design, which can save time and resources. It also ensures that the robotic system satisfies its specifications, thereby reducing the risk of unexpected behavior that could result in accidents or damage to the robot or its environment. Finally, it enables the systematic verification of the robot’s behavior in different scenarios, which is particularly important in safety-critical applications. In this workshop, we will cover some essential concepts in formal methods and control theory and illustrate the potential of such techniques in developing high-quality and safe robotic systems. The talks in this workshop will cover topics including but not limited to Abstraction-based methods for planning and control design for robotics systems. Learning methods for robot control with formal specifications. Game-theoretic planning and control frameworks for robot manipulation. Formal synthesis for compositional and decentralized control for multi-robot systems Reachability analysis and safety verification for safety-critical robotic applications.

 Geriatronics: AI and Robotics for Health & Well-Being in Older Age     
   
 Organizers:  Luis Figueredo, Abdeldjallil Naceri, Waldez Gomes, Sylvain Calinon, Ayse Kucukyilmaz, Praminda Caleb-Solly, Hinrich Schütze, Emmanuel Senft, Sami Haddadin  
 Abstract:  As life expectancy continuously rises, the world’s population grows older: According to recent projections by the United Nations, people over age 65 — so-called third-agers — are the fastest-growing age group. In 2025, third-agers are expected to constitute 25% of the world’s Population. This demographic change majorly increases the prevalence of age-related conditions and raises novel social-economical challenges related to the increasing demand for health care, assisted living facilities, or retirement homes, while addressing the reduced workforce. This workshop aims to bring to light the current and envisioned AI and robotic solutions in the context of Geriatronics and to address pressing challenges regarding (i) How the new generation of robotics and AI technology can address the challenges stemming from the increasing shortage and geographic disparities of care providers and the overburdened health-care? (ii) How to build a new generation of accessible, intelligent assistive robotics technologies that enhance independence and self-determination for people with lived experience of disability? (iii) How to systematically identify the potential facilitators and barriers to the acceptance of a robotic-technology-based assistive system that enhances improved independence and overall health benefits? How to improve adaptation, interaction, and acceptance? (iv) How to address the natural morals and ethics and/or individual needs/dilemmas in a world of care-supporting robots?

 Human Multi-Robot Interaction     
   
 Organizers:  Nils Wilde, Javier Alonso-Mora, Daniel Brown, Connor Mattson, Katia Sycara  
 Abstract:  With autonomous robots becoming increasingly capable we expect to see their deployment in a broader range of applications and at larger scale. Thus, there is a need for human-robot interaction (HRI) studies on how multi-robot systems can work with and around humans, how end-users can refine their behavior, and how to enable efficient coordination of robot fleets to accomplish complex tasks. In this workshop, we focus on fundamental challenges around the interaction of humans with multi-robot systems. From an HRI perspective, this prompts new challenges arising from the complexity and scalability issues specific to multi-robot problems. Conversely, the design of multi-robot systems needs to consider the usability by, and interaction with, different end-users such as system operators, human co-workers or people sharing the robots’ environment. Thus, we aim to bring together experts from both HRI and multi-robot systems to discuss pressing research questions such as “How can we develop intuitive HRI frameworks that scale to complex multi-robot systems?”, “What are open algorithmic challenges for human multi-robot interaction?”, “How can multi-agent systems benefit from human feedback and human-in-the-loop learning?”, “How can multi-robot systems convey their strategies to users?”, “What are effective representations for multi-robot plans and strategies?” We envision that this workshop will initiate active discussions between academic and industrial researchers, encourage new connections and collaborations, and ultimately help advance the efficient deployment of robot fleets by respective end-users.

 Integrated Perception, Planning, and Control for Physically and Contextually-Aware Robot Autonomy     
   
 Organizers:  Omur Arslan, Nikolay Atanasov, Mehmet Dogar, H. Jin Kim, Rafael Papallas  
 Abstract:  Robots capable of autonomous navigation and manipulation with advanced perception and decision-making skills offer tremendous potential to assist people with challenging and repetitive tasks in the service industry, including transportation, logistics, and healthcare. Recent advances in artificial perception enable robots to have semantic understanding and contextual awareness of their surroundings. Similarly, recent years have seen significant progress in decision-making for autonomous navigation and manipulation in complex situations. However, the gap between robot perception and decision-making remains large, as many techniques continue to rely on separation principles between perception, planning, and control. The objective of this workshop is to inspire the robotics community to pursue techniques that tightly integrate perception, planning, and control to achieve physically and contextually safe robot navigation and manipulation in real human environments. Robots sharing the same environment with people need novel semantic planning objectives that integrate perception and planning at a high level to generate contextually relevant robot behavior. At a low level, integrated perception and control require new metric and contextual safety constraints to enable physically safe and socially aware robot behavior. Uncertainty and error quantification in learning-based perception and control is essential for safe and robust robot operation. This workshop will bring together experts from academia and industry to identify and discuss the current challenges and emerging opportunities in perception-aware robot navigation and manipulation, leading to robot perception techniques that actively plan observations and interactions to acquire informative data, and robot planning and control techniques that actively utilize geometric and semantic perceptual information in generating, executing, and adapting robot actions.

 MADGames: Workshop on Multi-Agent Dynamic Games     
   
 Organizers:  Rahul Mangharam, Johannes Betz, Venkat Krovi, Hongrui Zheng  
 Abstract:  Decision-making in real-world multi-agent systems, especially where agent teams collaborate to compete while operating with full dynamics in changing environments and imperfect opponent information, is an important and challenging problem with many applications in next-generation robotics. The MAD-Games Multi-Agent Dynamic Games workshop at IROS aims to explore the latest advances in using game-theoretic and multi-agent learning approaches to help performant autonomous agents understand safe interaction with diverse competitive strategies. One of the key challenges in designing effective algorithms is handling the complex and highly interactive behavior between agents. Existing game theory models often rely on an oversimplified discretization of agent action spaces and strong assumptions such as perfect information and rational decision-making. These lead to inaccurate descriptions of the dynamics of real-world interactions. Additionally, the highly dynamic and unpredictable nature of real-world robotic systems can make it difficult to predict the behavior of the system, leading to safety risks. These dynamic games are inherently challenging as (a) crashing is dangerous and expensive, (b) Current sensors cannot infer the intention or strategy of the opponent, and (c) We are in a small-data regime as we cannot use past games to learn from as strategies, environments, and vehicles change. The MAD Games workshop focuses on addressing these challenges by bringing together researchers and practitioners to (1) explore the latest developments in game theory for interactive decision-making with learning-enabled multi-agent systems and (2) investigate how game-theoretic models can be adapted to handle the complexities of real-world robotic systems.

 Methods for Objective Comparison of Results in Intelligent Robotics Research     
   
 Organizers:  Fabio Bonsignorio, Angela Faragasso, Tomoyuki Yamamoto, Signe A. Redfield, Angel Pasqual del Pobil  
 Abstract:  The reproducibility of research results and the objective and operational comparison of different methods is still not mainstream in Robotics, AI and Automation Research. However, thanks to the Reproducible-article process in IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine, it is now possible both to publish reproducible research results and objectively compare the performances of different methods. This interactive and participatory workshop aims at providing the necessary knowledge to develop and report reproducible research and to enable objective comparison of performance. In this workshop we will focus on benchmarking methods with a special focus on statistical significance of results, approaches to randomized experimental studies and (ontologies for) the classification of intelligent and autonomous robotic systems. Basics about methods for reproducible robotics techniques will also be delivered to allow profitable attendance of researchers still not aware of reproducible research methods. The workshop will encourage interaction by challenging the participants to solve simple but not simpler case studies about benchmarking experiments in different competing groups. Attendees will be encouraged to submit to the peer scrutiny of other participants about their own case studies and the final discussion and analysis of the case studies will be an integral part of the learning process.

 No More Slow Flexible Robots: Discussions on advancements in design and control of compliant robotic systems     
   
 Organizers:  Sehoon Oh, Jinoh Lee, Manuel Keppler, Nicholas Paine and Elliott J Rouse  
 Abstract:  Emerging robotic systems hold the potential to transform nearly every aspect of daily life. However, while substantial contributions have been made in artificial intelligence, the physical abilities of most robotic systems remain limited; these systems often move slowly when performing precise motions and present challenges in scalability and adaptability across different uses. Flexible robots containing various elastic components that provide a host of potential benefits, including compliance, energy storage, and shock tolerance, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, such as rehabilitation, exploration and rescue, and collaborative robots. Despite this promise, the motion of elastic robots has been limited in terms of speed and highly dynamic motion; to solve the challenges of rapid, dynamic motion with flexible robotic systems requires a comprehensive approach. This workshop aims to bring together experts in the field of elastic robots to discuss the latest techniques and applications in the highly dynamic motion of flexible robots. 1) To provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to present and discuss the advances to realize dynamic motions on flexible/elastic robots. 2) To identify the challenges and opportunities in high-speed motions of flexible/elastic robots as an emerging research topic to be addressed. 3) To promote collaboration and knowledge sharing among researchers and practitioners in the field.

 Policy Learning in Geometric Spaces     
   
 Organizers:  Fabian Otto, Nicolas Schreiber, Ning Gao, Vien Ngo, Danny Driess, Gerhard Neumann, Clemens Eppner, Georgia Chalvatzaki  
 Abstract:  The field of robotics is constantly evolving and demands robots to operate effectively in complex, 3D environments. A critical requirement for this is the ability of robots to learn policies for tasks such as grasping, manipulation, motion planning, and more. In recent years, reinforcement learning has emerged as a promising approach for policy learning in 3D geometric spaces. Specifically, researchers have focused on the use of point clouds, neural representations of geometry (NeRFs, neural SDFs, or occupancy networks), occlusion maps, and other techniques to achieve this. The persistent challenge in integrating geometric representation in policy learning lies in effectively bridging the gap between high-dimensional and low-dimensional representations of complex spatial environments. To encourage knowledge sharing and foster collaborations, this workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working in this area to discuss the latest developments and identify challenges. Through this collaborative effort, we hope to further advance the field of robotics and reinforce the importance of policy learning in geometric spaces.

 Reactive and Predictive Humanoid Whole-body Control     
   
 Organizers:  Tianwei Zhang, Emel Demircan, Yan Gu, Yuquan Wang  
 Abstract:  Humanoid robots are increasingly expected to move with the same agility and speed as humans. However, traditional reactive control designs often lack a predictive horizon or rely on linear time-invariant models, which makes it difficult to guarantee the existence or uniqueness of a feasible solution. As a result, the current state-of-the-art in predictive control is often limited to suboptimal motions, such as fixed angular momentum trajectories, fixed center of mass height, or coplanar foot contacts. This workshop aims to address these challenges by bringing experts with diverse backgrounds in academia and industry, to share the latest control design and software tools spanning optimization-based control, hybrid control, and planning. Topics will include, but are not limited to, high-order differential dynamics, centroidal dynamics approximation, angular momentum tracking, floating-base state estimation, balance control on uneven terrain, whole-body model predictive control, human motion understanding and imitation, control design on open-source platforms, and emerging data-driven approaches. Attendees will have the opportunity to engage in face-to-face discussions with both junior and senior scientists, gain hands-on experience with the latest control software, and network with researchers from the United States, Europe, and Asia. We will also live-cast the workshop on YouTube and disseminate recorded presentations through our website. Beyond scientific contributions in humanoid robotics, this workshop has a significant societal impact. Real-time locomotion control is essential for developing future assistive devices, such as exoskeletons or prostheses. Our U.S.-based organizers will host an outreach event for local college students during the proposed workshop. In summary, this workshop will highlight the latest key theories, techniques, and insights for the development of next-generation humanoid robot systems with agile and robust locomotion capabilities, while promoting idea exchange and community engagement.

 RoboTac 2023: Visuo-Tactile Perception, Learning, Control for Manipulation and HRI Emerging Data Driven Approach     
   
 Organizers:  Mohsen Kaboli, Vincent Hayward, Anirvan Dutta, Henrik Jörntell, Etienne Burdet  
 Abstract:  Haptics intelligence, or the sense of touch, enables humans to interact with their environment and is crucial to manipulation challenges in everyday life. It enables grasping, manipulation, learning, and decision-making based on the information from mechanoreceptors distributed in muscles and over the skin as well as the interaction dynamics. Humans use haptic exploration to interact with their environment, e.g. to recognise an object’s shape and mechanical properties. Haptic sensing is a capability that robotic systems need to acquire for safely and efficiently interacting with their environment and with humans. Haptic sensing is essential to perform a variety of tasks in industrial applications, consumer services, and other highly dynamic environments such as assistance and care for elderly, housekeeping, etc. However, it is still challenging for robots to carry out haptic exploration smoothly and recognise objects efficiently, especially in an unstructured environment with soft materials and different textures, inherent sensor and motor noise, and delay in sensory signal processing. Traditionally, robotics has started to treat haptics like vision, and the dominating aspect of haptics, mechanical interaction, has often been neglected. Mechanical interaction greatly complicates the design of sensing techniques that are fundamentally robust to sensing conditions and resilient to wear and abrasion, and conditions haptic perception. Therefore, this year we will focus on neuroscience, material and signal processing aspects of haptics considering the mechanical interaction dynamics. We have assembled a team of experts in all these fields contributing to cutting edge research in haptics both in humans and for robots. The workshop will enable exchange of ideas between these experts and the underlying field, to foster fresh ideas through interdisciplinary discussions while paving the way for future collaborations.

 Robotics for the Gut     
   
 Organizers:  Ebubekir Avci, Eric Diller, Pietro Valdastri  
 Abstract:  Robotic systems for treatment and diagnosis of the gastrointestinal tract have attracted increasing attention in the last two decades. Miniaturization of mechanical and electronic components has enabled researchers to develop functional capsules with robotic capabilities including locomotion, delivery, and collection of samples. Numerous applications, such as drug delivery, tissue biopsy, and detection of gut related diseases, have been realised in vivo. In addition to further development of novel platforms, this research area is now at the point where it faces the challenges of transforming exceptional research prototypes into robust and marketable products. Researchers must call on a number of technical domains to address the challenges in this field including locomotion, localisation, actuation, sensing, manufacturing, and instrumentation. This workshop aims to bring researchers together from across the international community to present an overview of the application domains of gut related robotics, and the challenges that should be addressed for realization of these systems. Presentations of both recognized research teams (academia and industry) and highly promising early-career researchers will help to advance the state-of-the-art scientific results in the direction of marketable products.

 Teaching & Training Students for Cognitive Robotics     
   
 Organizers:  Jörn Syrbe, Michael Beetz, Petra Wenzl, Karinne Ramirez-Amaro, David Vernon, Leonie Dziomba  
 Abstract:  The implementation and design of cognitive Robot-Systems is a challenging process which requiers an overview of the physics of robots & their environments, sensors & sensor data, perception, probabilistic state estimation, knowledge representation and reasoning, robot learning, task and motion control, and cognitive architectures. It takes just as much effort to consider these issues when designing robots as it does to teach the entirety of robotics. How can we establish and foster the capabilities to understand the interrelation of constituent system parts and how systems work over time and within the context of larger systems (System thinking), the decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithm design (Computational thinking), strategies, processes and abstraction (Mathematical thinking), the ability to make reasoned decisions (Decision making), the awareness on how technology impacts society (Sustainability), and the intrinsic motivation and willingness to solve challenges of robotics (Motivation)? In this workshop, we address this very challenge by systematizing a best practice from experienced teachers and researchers. How is it possible to integrate the needs of all stakeholders? What are the perspectives of Students, Educators & Researchers, as well as state of the art in cognitive robotics? All of these considerations should also include the demands of society on the subject of cognitive robotics.

 Workshop on Leveraging Models for Contact-Rich Manipulation     
   
 Organizers:  H.J. Terry Suh, Tao Pang, Xianyi Cheng, Alp Aydinoglu, Simon Le Cleac’h, Brian Pancher, Russ Tedrake  
 Abstract:  Contact-rich manipulation remains a grand challenge for robotics. By enabling robots to automatically reason through a rich set of contacts with objects and the surrounding environment, dexterous manipulation capabilities can widely broaden the spectrum of physical tasks that can be automated. Traditionally, model-based methods have tackled contact-rich manipulation by utilizing and studying the structure of contact models to come up with planning and control algorithms. In contrast, recent learning-based methods have achieved new capabilities by utilizing massive amounts of data, yet the methods do not take advantage of model structure within contact-rich manipulation. The current shift of paradigm towards learning-based methods presents many opportunities for the model-based manipulation community that can combine the effectiveness of learning-based methods with the efficiency of models. The objective of this workshop is to bring together researchers in the model-based manipulation community to present their work and review state-of-the art methods in the field. In conjunction, the workshop aims to facilitate discussions on the future of the field and ask several important questions, such as: how can we synthesize model-based approaches and recent learning approaches into a coherent whole? Do we believe that there is structure we can leverage from the models that we use to better inform planning and control algorithms?

 World-Wide Network of AI Labs in Hospital     
   
 Organizers:  Shingo Shimoda, Juan C. Moreno, Diego Torricelli, Jesus Tornero, Fady Alnajjar, Qi An, Sayako Ueda, Zen Koh, Yasuhisa Hirata, Jose L. Pons  
 Abstract:  Recent advances in robotics and AI have opened up numerous possibilities for improving the usability of various devices and discovering new phenomena across various fields. One of the most important fields that can benefit from these advancements is medicine. In the medical domain, these applications go beyond just surgical robots and rehabilitation devices that enhance or replace human capabilities. They include addressing issues beyond traditional medical approaches, such as identifying disease sources, visualizing the recovery process, developing new therapeutic treatments, and providing appropriate movement support, based on detailed measurement and modeling of bio-signals from humans. To meet these unmet medical needs, it is crucial to have closer collaboration of the engineering and the medical fields. One approach is through the establishment of “AI Labs” attached to hospitals, which utilize robotics technology and AI to measure and support patients in actual medical settings. Some of these labs are located as described in Figure 1. These AI Labs are generating new knowledge for treating and rehabilitating various diseases. However, each AI Lab operates independently, and the knowledge and methods obtained are not standardized across organizations. To accelerate research in this field, it is essential to share the approaches for establishing novel standards. This workshop aims to establish a network of AI Labs in hospitals across five countries, as depicted in Figure 1. Through this network, we believe that engineers and medical doctors not only from these Labs, but also various researchers who are interested in this field can easily collaborate and discuss the possibilities for enhancing medical research and practice.

 Novel Sensors for Autonomous Vehicle Perception     
   
 Organizers:  Katie Skinner, Ram Vasudevan, Manikandasriram Srinivasan Ramanagopal, Radhika Ravi, Austin Buchan, Spencer Carmichael, Gaurav Pandey, Alexandra (Alexa) Carlson  
 Abstract:  Current systems for autonomous vehicle (AV) perception rely on widely used sensors such as cameras and LiDAR systems. However, AV perception systems based on conventional sensors suffer in various lighting and adverse weather conditions. For example, conventional visual frame-based cameras are widely used due to their low-cost and high spatial resolution. Yet, AV perception systems based on conventional cameras are challenged by low-light conditions, fog, rain, and snow, and suffer from issues including motion blur, limited frame rates, and low dynamic range. Novel sensors, such as event and thermal cameras, offer alternatives that address these limitations. Event cameras feature high temporal resolution, effectively no motion blur, high dynamic range, low power requirements, and low latency. These qualities make event cameras promising under adverse lighting, fast motion, and resource constraints. Thermal cameras sensitive to the Long Wave Infrared spectrum can operate in the absence of visible light and are robust to changes in illumination and visual obscurants such as fog, dust, and smoke. Alongside these advantages are challenges: thermal cameras are lower contrast and experience greater motion blur, while event cameras represent a new paradigm that is not directly compatible with existing algorithms. Advancing AV capabilities to leverage novel sensors will require further research development across academia and industry. This workshop seeks to engage the research community in discussion of exciting new research topics in novel sensors for AV perception, and will feature the release of a unique dataset for AV perception with novel sensors, and a student poster session.

 2nd Workshop on Social Robot Navigation: Advances and Evaluation     
   
 Organizers:  Allan Wang, Nathan Tsoi, Benjamin Stoler, Phani Teja Singamaneni, Alhanof Alolyan, Rohan Chandra, Marynel Vázquez, Jean Oh, He Wang, Rachid Alami, Aaron Steinfeld  
 Abstract:  With robots beginning to share spaces with humans in uncontrolled environments, social robot navigation is an increasingly relevant area of robotics research. However, robots navigating around humans still presents many challenges. Recent works have shown that it is insufficient for robots to simply consider humans as “dynamic obstacles”. How can a robot navigate safely and efficiently among crowds? How can a robot capture environmental context and obey social rules? How should we measure and benchmark a robot’s navigation performance? We propose to bring together experts and community members from diverse backgrounds to discuss advances in social navigation and to unify efforts around evaluation methods. This workshop is a sequel to our successful workshop at ICRA’22. The day-long event will feature invited expert speakers, poster presentations, a moderated panel discussion, and benchmark challenges. We will announce the winner of the SEANavbench challenge. SEANavbench is our open-source benchmarking suite which enables training and evaluating social navigation systems in a high visual fidelity environment. We will also announce two new social-navigation benchmark tracks for 1) multi-agent planning and 2) trajectory forecasting.

 2nd XR-ROB Workshop on "Horizons of an Extended Robotics Reality" - a Converging Future of XR and Robotics     
   
 Organizers:  Nikhil Deshpande, Helen Oleynikova, Mitsuhiro Kamezaki, S. Farokh Atashzar, Daniel Szafir, Fumihiro Kato, Jeffrey Delmerico  
 Abstract:  Extended reality (XR) is a “catch-all” term, extending the representation of the real world to humans, to enhance their interaction with it through (a) Augmented Reality, enhancing a user’s perception of the real world through spatially superimposed virtual information, (b) Virtual Reality, immersing the user in a 3D virtual world allowing presence and interaction with virtual information, and (c) Mixed Reality, combining the virtual and real worlds and the spatial superimposition for perception and interaction. These topics intersect with robotics in important ways: (i) XR essentially requires the same spatial perception of the environment as a robotic agent interacting in a real-world environment; (ii) XR interfaces and robots utilize prior knowledge of how humans perceive, represent, and move through space for tasks, e.g., semantic scene understanding; and (iii) XR is a simulation environment for realistic physics-based interaction between elements, which can be exploited for robot learning. XR and Robotics draw on contributions from diverse fields, e.g., robot mechanisms, control, haptics, simulations and digital twins, HCI/HRI, AI/ML/DL, SLAM, neural interfaces, natural language and gesture understanding, user interface design, as well as cognitive psychology. This workshop brings together researchers from the XR and Robotics worlds, with the goal of discussing how XR helps address challenges in robotics through the theoretical and experimental bases of perception, cognition, and interaction behavior in XR technologies, including environments design, data representation (virtual models, interaction physics, rendering, video, point-clouds, 3D reconstruction, ambient sensors), sensory substitution (tactile, auditory), natural gesture and intention understanding, real-time data transmission, etc.

 6th Ergonomic Physical Human-Robot Collaboration: Harnessing Advancements in Robot Learning     
   
 Organizers:  Luka Peternel, Wansoo Kim, Heni Ben Amor, Arash Ajoudani, Eiichi Yoshida  
 Abstract:  Collaborative and wearable robots in workspaces present potentially powerful tools for the field of ergonomics, paving the way to promote work efficiency and safety. These robots can anticipate and mitigate the physical risk factors related to work-related musculoskeletal disorders, for example, by incorporating human models into robot control to make it aware of the human co-worker’s ergonomic status and actively reconfiguring the work process with the robot. To tackle these major challenges and opportunities, we previously organized a series of successful workshops at IROS and ICRA. So far, our focus was primarily on using classical human physical and cognitive models and the associated pros and cons. Our previous workshop talks and discussions spotlighted the reliability of such models, however, raised several open questions about their personalization. On the other hand, the robotics community has made substantial progress on the topics of machine learning in the past decade, which offers great potential for model personalisation and enhanced adaptiveness of models and robot behaviours to facilitate ergonomics. Hence, the objectives of the proposed workshop are i) to review the progress which was achieved since our last workshop, ii) to discuss how robot learning methods can help with ergonomic human-robot collaboration iii) to form guidelines for future research in this direction. This agenda requires experts from various research fields and interdisciplinary discussions. Thus, we assembled a diverse yet synergistic set of organizers and speakers, who are leading experts in their respective areas that are highly relevant to the workshop topic.

 Assistive Robotics for Citizens     
   
 Organizers:  Julia Starke, Noémie Jaquier, Leimin Tian, Yasuhisa Hirata, Dana Kulic, Serena Ivaldi, Tamim Asfour  
 Abstract:  The development of assistive robotic technologies is crucial to tackle upcoming critical societal challenges, including the aging society and the increasing intermixing of work and leisure, among others. Assistive robots may be of particular help in caregiving, in completing household chores, and in supporting and augmenting humans. In particular, the support of assistive robots may enable elderly and impaired people to lead an autonomous and self-determined life. To provide personalized assistance, future assistive robots must be able to operate and evolve around humans in a daily basis and in dynamic real-world environments, to efficiently and continually learn new tasks from human and interaction with the world, to coherently extrapolate their knowledge to solve previously unseen problems, and to quickly adapt to changes. This workshop is aimed as a discussion on the development of assistive robots — including humanoid robots, exoskeletons, and other assistive devices — to support people in their daily life. We aim at bringing together researchers from various robotic areas to explore the core challenges, ranging from building assistive robots tailored to human environments to incrementally learning safe robot skills based on experience and interaction. Finally, this workshop aims at building bridges between the robotics community and researchers in other disciplines such as social and sport sciences, which are crucial to complement the core robotics research and strive towards versatile and holistic assistive robotic systems.

 Causality for Robotics: Answering the Question of Why     
   
 Organizers:  Tabitha Edith Lee, Zizhao Wang, Sarvesh Patil, Caleb Chuck, Jiaheng Hu, Prof. Yuke Zhu, Prof. Oliver Kroemer  
 Abstract:  The grand vision of robotics for general-purpose machines that can act, perceive, and learn in real-world environments must be met with intelligent capabilities of equal measure. To date, tremendous advances in robotic artificial intelligence have been achieved primarily through correlation-based methods. Yet, correlation is not causation: correlation-based methods can lack robust generalization, are brittle to distribution shifts, and can learn incorrect, spurious relationships in observed data. However, a hallmark of human intelligence — reasoning about cause-and-effect — can provide clues towards the next generation of embodied intelligence for robots. Indeed, the advantages of adopting the principles of causality have been witnessed to date in fields such as biomedical science, economics, and genomics. Recently, it has been argued that the machine learning community should adopt the principles of causal inference, towards causal learning of representations. Analogously, this workshop argues that the field of robotics stands to gain by integrating causality, moving robotics towards human-like embodied intelligence. Can robots learn and leverage the causal structure of problems? Can interventions and counterfactuals provide greater robot intelligence? And, ultimately, what next-generational capabilities can be unlocked through robots that can answer the question of “Why”? To this end, this workshop brings together experts in both causality and robotics to present recent advancements in the intersection of these areas and discuss implications of causal-based methods for robotics. Academic and industry researchers will discuss the fundamental challenges and opportunities that arise in the development and deployment of robots and autonomous agents that leverage these principles, advancing robotics beyond correlations.

 Debate: Data vs Model in Medical Robotics     
   
 Organizers:  Giovanni Pittiglio, Yash Chitalia, Animesh Garg, Xiaoguang Dong  
 Abstract:  The application of robotic solutions to healthcare has soared in the past two decades, spanning from rigid to flexible and fully soft robots which can aid in diagnosis and therapy inside the human body. Control, design, sensing and fabrication of these robots is based on understanding their behavior and interaction with the anatomy; this is a major challenge and general approaches are hard to define. In addressing this fundamental challenge, researchers have considered several techniques which range from model-based to data-driven approaches. The former is based on mechanically accurate modelling, while the latter focus on information provided from data and are devoted to learning. This workshop aims to bring together researchers from the areas of machine learning and medical robotics to explore the opportunities and interplay between these two sub-domains. The goal is to understand areas to explore and how researchers can combine these main approaches, towards improving the current practice in the modeling and control of new robot architectures with inherent uncertainties (e.g. soft and continuum robots and wire-actuated robots).

 Enabling Robot Swarms Across Scales     
   
 Organizers:  Steven Ceron, Kirstin Petersen, Yufeng Chen, Daniela Rus  
 Abstract:  Natural swarms consistently demonstrate that a collective composed of simple constituents can exhibit functions that far exceed the capabilities of any single agent. Social amoeba, for example, is composed of thousands of cells that use local oscillatory chemical signaling to collectively reconfigure their morphology and functions as a response to nutrients in the surrounding environment. This species embodies many features that swarm roboticists envision in scalable, self-reconfigurable robot collectives at all length scales: local-to-global behaviors, low-level communication, plasticity, and simple constituents. This vision drives our workshop’s goal: to bring together roboticists working on micron scale and macro-scale systems with a shared interest in swarming systems. We will bring together eminent experts on swarm robotics that demonstrate that regardless of the length scale, they can exploit robot morphology, physical interactions among agents, and low-level coordination mechanisms to enable collective behaviors for diverse applications. Our workshop will feature keynote presentations by experts and rising stars on recent research on swarm robotics ranging from simulation to physical realization studies; directed group discussions between researchers originating from diverse fields related to robot swarm fabrication, actuation, sensing, and coordination; and poster presentation sessions with video demonstrations of robot swarms. We aim to (1) inspire new robot collective systems that borrow methods of interaction between agents from the opposite end of the length scale, (2) introduce researchers to diverse sets of local interaction mechanisms that can enable complex and functional collective behaviors at various length scales, and (3) facilitate discussion between established researchers and rising stars.

 Tutorial: Everyday Activity Robot Manipulation in an Interactive Learning Environment     
   
 Organizers:  Michael Beetz, Jörn Syrbe, Arthur Niedzwiecki, Giang Nguyen, Sascha Jongebloed  
 Abstract:  Cognitive robotics is a driving force for the development of AI systems that can master complex tasks autonomously. These knowledge-based robotic systems are able to interpret their environment, thus allowing them to interpret the context and to understand vaguely formulated instructions. The skills to understand and develop such systems can best be taught using the robot control system as a structure that is then deconstructed into its components, enabling students to understand all relevant components as well as how they interact with each other. One of the milestones of the European Robotics and AI Network (euROBIN) is for a robot to receive a parcel from a human, open, and empty it. Based on this scenario, we present a best practice tutorial on how to implement a solution for this task that integrates all necessary software components in the framework of the robot control process. In the context of this tutorial, we focus on knowledge representation and reasoning, planning, and the simulation framework (Mujoco), bringing these components together into a learning environment that – in the extended version – introduces the whole control process of Cognitive Robotics. The learning environment follows an immersive approach, using a physics-based simulation environment for visualization purposes that helps to illustrate the concepts taught in the tutorial. Using Jupyter Notebooks in a Docker environment, our learning environment is easily accessible without having to install different software packages and is independent of the learners’ technical setup. The tutorial is a shortened version of the full one-week tutorial presented at the EASE Fall School 2023 (which is a consistent further development of the hands-on courses of the Fall Schools, which have been held annually since 2018) and aims to introduce the teaching approach as a best practice example.

 "It works really well!": Verification in Theory and Practice     
   
 Organizers:  Signe Redfield, Dejanira Araiza Illan, Emily C. Collins, Michael Fisher, Kevin Leahy, Joanna Olszewska, Nico Hochgeschwender, John S. Baras, Angelo Ferraro, Cristian Vasile, Javier Ibañez-Guzmán  
 Abstract:  “It works really well!” is the expected conclusion of academic publications, technical reports, and project outcomes that seek to demonstrate a designed system (i.e. robot, autonomous vehicle, controller) is functionally sound, safe and/or trustworthy. In this workshop, we aim to dissect and examine under a critical eye each component of the phrase: the “It”, namely how the system under- test has been defined for verification and validation purposes, and how this meets the needs for robotics in sectors such as autonomous vehicles and medical robots; the “works”, namely the definition of the system’s tasks or behaviours, including systems that might learn and at industrial scale; the “really well”, namely the formulation of metrics, evaluation tools, reproducibility and replicability frameworks, and extensibility to an “industrial grade”; and, furthermore, the ability to openly report “failures”. The workshop will bring together experts in robotics, verification and validation, end-user experience, regulations and standards, formal methods, assurance and certification, and industries including healthcare, transportation, aviation, military, and automotive. We will have three sessions with invited talks followed by Q&A, and a fourth session with an interactive panel. We aim to open new avenues for future interdisciplinary collaboration among participants and expect that this will significantly advance the field of verification of autonomous systems.

 Learning Meets Model-based Methods for Manipulation and Grasping     
   
 Organizers:  Raffaello Camoriano, Cristina Piazza, Giuseppe Averta, Lorenzo Natale, Carlo Masone  
 Abstract:  Building robots capable of dexterous interaction with objects to carry out fine manipulation tasks has always been a grand challenge in robotics. The non-smooth, brittle nature of manipulator-object mechanics, together with perceptual uncertainty, easily violate the assumptions of early planning and control methods. Furthermore, accurate physical modeling of complex or non-rigid mechanical systems requires large amounts of computations, which is incompatible with real-time control. Such challenges led researchers to develop a wide range of approaches, from adaptive control tailored to the (potentially changing) properties of the object at hand, to advanced perception to tackle measurement uncertainty. Machine learning also contributed by providing actionable representations of complex geometries and visual appearance, and by encoding hard-to-model expert demonstrations to reduce the cost of trial-and-error. In turn, these informed the development of novel robot control methods enabling more robust and dexterous skills. At the same time, the employment of mechanical models proved effective for enforcing structural constraints in robot control systems (including learning-based ones), thus improving safety and guiding exploration. However, there are still many open challenges that need to be addressed to achieve long-horizon robotic manipulation and sidestep the computational burden of accurate simulation of contact-rich scenarios. The ambition of this workshop is to provide a comprehensive overview of the broad and scattered state of the art in robot manipulation and grasping, spanning model-based and learning-based approaches. Talks and interactive sessions will enable a deeper understanding of current approaches in different use cases, while stimulating the development of new methods.

 Learning Robot Super Autonomy     
   
 Organizers:  Giuseppe Loianno, Davide Scaramuzza  
 Abstract:  Autonomous aerial and ground robots have the potential to assist humans in complex, timesensitive, and dangerous tasks such as search and rescue or monitoring in indoor and outdoor environments. This requires single and multiple robots to autonomously navigate in a coordinated, agile, and collaborative manner in uncertain, dynamic, cluttered, and extreme environments. The focus of this workshop is to study and analyze the role and benefits of data-driven techniques in the sense and act problem for achieving robot super autonomy. Robot super autonomy refers to unmanned, agile, resilient, and collaborative machines that can make decisions without human intervention, and can outperform current autonomous vehicles in uncertain, complex, dynamic, extreme, and cluttered environments. In this context, Learning-based solutions are becoming essential approaches in complementing or replacing physics-based techniques at the control, perception, and planning levels to boost online navigation performances, robots’ resilience, and algorithms’ scalability in terms of the number and types of robots. This workshop will bring together researchers, industry experts, and practitioners from the aerial, ground, space, and legged robotics communities. The audience will be heterogeneous in terms of expertise and interests, involving people from academia, industry, and government agencies, as well as practitioners focusing on the broad areas of robotics, AI, and machine learning for autonomous robots working across air, space, ground, and off-terrain domains. The workshop will be extremely relevant for researchers to foster ideas in the areas of robotics, AI, and related disciplines, learn about the challenges and limitations of current approaches for robot super autonomy, and explore potential solutions. Finally, this event includes several activities tailored for early-career researchers, giving them an opportunity to learn about the latest advances in autonomous robot technology.

 Multilimb Coordination in Human Neuroscience and Robotics: Classical and Learning Perspectives     
   
 Organizers:  Soheil Gholami, Kunpeng Yao, James Hermus, Etienne Burdet, Aude Billard  
 Abstract:  The ability of humans to effectively coordinate their limbs in diverse situations, such as manipulating objects, dancing, or playing the guitar, has captivated the attention of researchers from a variety of fields from neuroscience to robotics. Neuroscience researchers often use robotics techniques to model human motor control. Conversely, roboticists strive to use new control and learning algorithms to endow robots with human-like abilities such as regulating many degrees of freedom, behaving in a way that is robust to disturbances, and managing complex contact situations. The interplay of human motor control and robotics has been fruitful, with achievements in inverse optimal control, learning-based methods, and variable impedance control. These existing interdisciplinary studies present new challenges that require further discussion and exploration. This full-day workshop will bring together young and senior researchers at the forefront of human motor control and robotics to discuss the trends and challenges in these fields. Moderated live Q&A panel discussions will provide an opportunity for attendees to discuss open questions and challenges facing the field of behavioral neuroscience and robotics in future research, and to examine how state-of-the-art studies apply these approaches in both fields.

 Present and Future of Agricultural Robotics and Technologies: Academic and Industry Perspectives     
   
 Organizers:  Konstantinos Karydis, Stefano Carpin, Stavros Vougioukas, Cyrill Stachniss  
 Abstract:  Increasing population, decreasing arable land, climate change, and a declining skilled workforce pose unprecedented challenges to the ability to satisfy the growing demand for food on a global scale, in a sustainable manner. It is thus becoming more and more important to increase or at the very least maintain current productivity while using fewer inputs, such as water and agrichemicals. Precision agriculture (PA) aims to address this issue. In recent years there has been a boom in agricultural robotics and allied technology (e.g., vegetation-specific sensors) employed within PA routines. Such efforts have so far been undertaken in a rather decoupled manner. However, several research labs (both in academic and private sector settings) around the world are increasingly co-designing actuation and perception systems, to help introduce the agricultural robots of the future. This workshop aims to highlight and in turn help push forward co-design of actuation and perception efforts for future agricultural robotics. Its main objective is to bring together researchers that focus on robotics and sensor technologies, and who are situated both within academia and industry. Doing so will create stronger links between both ends. Academic researchers will have the opportunity to learn more about specific technologies that are already field-ready while industry partners will gather more detailed information about some key current challenges holding back agricultural robotics research that may not be possible to resolve in a scalable manner within the limits of academic research.

 Robotic Perception and Mapping: Frontier Vision & Learning Techniques     
   
 Organizers:  Nikolay Atanasov, Luca Carlone, Kevin Doherty, Kaveh Fathian, Golnaz Habibi, Jonathan How, John Leonard, Carlos Nieto, Hasan Poonawala, David Rosen, Sebastian Scherer, Chen Wang, Shibo Zhao  
 Abstract:  This workshop aims to present the latest advancements and frontier techniques in computer vision and machine learning that are expected to have a significant impact on robotic perception and mapping and set the direction of research in the next 5-10 years. Through a series of invited and contributed talks by renowned academic leaders and researchers, the event will discuss frontier technologies for robotic perception and mapping with particular focus on addressing existing computer vision challenges such as dealing with dynamic environments and non-rigid objects, trade-offs between scalability (capturing large environments over long periods of operation without running out of memory) versus expressivity (capturing precise details about the environment characteristics, including geometry, semantics, dynamics, topology), as well as addressing machine learning challenges such as reducing training and inference time of machine learning models, fitting large models on small robotic platforms, trade-offs between pre-training and fine-tuning environment models, and ensuring generalization and robustness. To encourage interaction among participants, the workshop will feature panel discussions, posters, and spotlight talks. The event will adopt a hybrid format with both in-person and remote participants. All talks and accepted contributions will be published on the workshop’s webpage to expand its reach and impact. This workshop is a follow-up to the well-received ICRA 2022 workshop on “Robotic Perception and Mapping: Emerging Techniques,” which had the largest attendance across all workshops with over 1,000 participants. This follow-up workshop will provide a new perspective by inviting a new set of speakers and discussing frontier research on computer vision and machine learning (instead of mapping, which was the focus of the previous workshop). To differentiate the workshop from traditional computer vision and machine learning conferences, the talks are particularly focused on techniques with direct application in robotic perception and autonomy.

 Robotics for the Blue Economy and Climate Resiliency     
   
 Organizers:  M. Ani Hsieh, Herbert Tanner, Kleio Baxevani, Victoria Edwards, Thales Costa Silva  
 Abstract:  The goal of this workshop is to bring together ocean science experts and roboticists across academia, government, and industry. The ocean is one of the Earth’s most valuable natural resources and a predominant driver of climate-weather patterns across the globe. Academic robotics research efforts have mostly focused on environmental monitoring, exploration, and information acquisition in support of ocean sciences. However, the growing need for climate adaptation, mitigation, and carbon emission reduction has increased the demand for commercial marine activities such as offshore wind exploitation and fisheries. Blue Economy—a term used to refer to all economic activity along the coasts and off to deep water—encompasses a wide range of industries and disciplines whose focus and interests are diverse and lack a well-defined regulatory framework. This creates a unique set of challenges when setting technological and scientific goals and specifications for prospective science and technology innovators and developers. This workshop will bring roboticists and practitioners in ocean related fields, to a common forum where they can both recognize each other’s perspectives on challenges and opportunities for sustainable and climate-change friendly growth in the Blue Economy. The workshop will enable the development of new synergies, opportunities for collaboration, and share challenges in current approaches. The goal is to unlock the potential for exponential growth of the Blue Economy. The workshop will feature presentations by invited speakers, a framed panel discussion, and two interactive sessions. During the interactive sessions, students and companies will present cutting-edge research and development and have networking opportunities.

 State of the Art in Robotic Leg Prostheses: Where We Are and Where We Want to Be     
   
 Organizers:  Tommaso Lenzi, Bobby Gregg, Elliott Rouse  
 Abstract:  Ambulation with conventional prostheses is slower, less stable, and less efficient than able-bodied ambulation, causing reduced mobility and quality of life. Robotic powered prostheses have the potential to close the gap between the performance of existing lower limb prostheses and human legs. In contrast to conventional passive prostheses, powered prostheses can provide biomechanically-accurate kinetics and kinematics, including during activities that require energy injection. Powered prostheses have evolved from devices tethered to a power supply or computer to devices that have onboard electronics and batteries. Powered prosthetic devices are now able to assist during walking, ambulation on stairs and ramps, and sit-stand transitions. However, there are significant challenges that the field needs to address for powered prostheses to fully realize their potential. Powered prostheses are often heavy, bulky, noisy, and fragile compared to conventional prostheses. Even the most advanced controllers cannot match the agility of the human body. Powered prostheses have made many advances but there are still challenges that must be addressed. This workshop will focus on the state-of-the-art and open challenges in powered prosthetics. Top researchers in the field will present their current and future approaches to designing and controlling powered prostheses. Live demonstration of powered prostheses will provide hands-on experience with leading technology. Poster sessions and panel discussions will provide further opportunities for participants to interact. This workshop will allow both established researchers and those new to the field of robotic prostheses, to experience where the field is today and what challenges lie ahead.

 Task and Motion Planning: from Theory to Practice     
   
 Organizers:  Neil T. Dantam, Khen Elimelech, Federico Pecora, Lydia E. Kavraki  
 Abstract:  Academic research into Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) has proceeded for well over a decade, producing key results in the analysis of, and algorithms for, TAMP scenarios. However, while certain aspects of TAMP research are currently reduced to practice, the overall inroads thus-far remain limited. This workshop aims to bring together academic and industry experts to discuss and reflect on the current state and direction of TAMP research and practice. Academic participants will offer the latest theoretical results and challenges in TAMP, while industry participants will present both successful applications and pragmatic challenges to TAMP adoption. Particularly, we aim to identify and discuss unsolved scientific challenges, and necessary systems developments, to broaden the impact of TAMP research. We hope that this workshop will stimulate insightful discussions and prioritization of efforts in TAMP research to address key practical needs.

 Tensegrity Robotics     
   
 Organizers:  Xiaonan Huang, William Johnson, Kun Wang, Shiyang Lu, Luyang Zhao, Joran Booth, Rebecca Kramer-Bottiglio, Devin Balkcom, Kostas E. Bekris  
 Abstract:  Composed of rigid struts and compliant tendons, tensegrity robots boast a remarkable strength-to-weight ratio and demonstrate extraordinary shape morphability, stiffness tuning, and impact resistance. These favorable properties make tensegrity robots an attractive technology for the next generation of adaptive, multi-terrain robots. The unique advantages of tensegrity robots show promise for impact-resistant planetary rovers, pipe-climbing robots that can change their shape, lightweight aerial robots, adaptive underwater robots, and more. However, tensegrity robots’ compliance, coupled dynamics, and many degrees of freedom pose challenges in actuation, sensing, and control. No work to date has achieved the ultimate goal of demonstrating a fully autonomous, untethered tensegrity robot that is capable of navigating unstructured terrain and surviving mechanical impacts. To address these grand challenges, the field of tensegrity robotics needs more research into tools and technologies for automated system design, state estimation, environmental sensing, and autonomous navigation. This workshop aims to bring together not only researchers who study tensegrity robots but also experts in complementary domains, specifically modular robotics, control systems, and sensing and perception, who can provide insights into and solutions to open challenges in our field. In this workshop, we will showcase the state of the art of tensegrity robotics, discuss the grand challenges tensegrity robots face, attract and engage new participants in the field, and facilitate future collaborations.

 The Next Step for Humanoids     
   
 Organizers:  Jim Pippine, Robert Griffin, Paul Oh, Taskin Padir  
 Abstract:  In October 2012, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency initiated a three year Robotics Challenge (DRC) designed to move humanoid robots out of the lab and into the field to assist in roles like disaster relief. The Challenge would culminate in 2015 with over 20 teams from around the world competing in a live event. It has been over 10 years since the start of the DRC and other competitions including the Avatar XPRIZE (2022) and the DARPA Subterranean Challenge (2021) have advanced the technologies, but a robust humanoid still does not exist. The workshop will review what was learned at those events by both the organizers and the participants and ask the question of how do we move forward as a community? The presentation and panels will discuss important lessons from prior work and highlight the key barriers to advancing humanoids. The intent is to identify areas that both researchers and sponsor agencies see as technical roadblocks and build a framework for pursuing further research.

 Tutorial on Computational Co-Design for Robotics     
   
 Organizers:  Andrew Spielberg, Andrea Censi, Emilio Frazzoli, Gioele Zardini  
 Abstract:  Building robots is the closest humans have come to creating artificial life. Embodied with sensing, action, and reasoning capabilities, robots hold the immense promise of surpassing the abilities of the animal kingdom. However, it is unclear that human designers alone can emulate or exceed life forms that have evolved over billions of years, filling various ecological niches and diverse physical forms. This tutorial explores the emerging field of computational robot design—computer-aided or computer-driven workflows that co-design robots by integrating geometry, topology, actuation, sensing, materiality, sensorimotor control, proprioception, and task-planning with higher-level reasoning. The tutorial provides participants with an introduction to robot co-design and aims to connect multiple communities to enable the development of composable models, algorithms, fabrication processes, and hardware for embodied intelligence.

 Workshop on Traffic Agent Modeling for Autonomous Driving Simulation     
   
 Organizers:  Maximilian Naumann, Maximilian Igl, Simon Suo, Thomas Gilles, Yiren Lu, Fabien Moutarde, Anca Dragan, Shimon Whiteson  
 Abstract:  Simulation is a crucial tool to accelerate the development of Autonomous Driving (AD) algorithms. Realistic traffic agent models reduce the sim-to-real gap and have the potential to massively scale evaluation of AD algorithms, paying into both development and safe deployment of AD systems. Research in traffic agent modeling has recently made great advances, for example due to the switch to graph neural networks and training through sequential decisions. Yet, the research is scattered over different robotics and machine learning venues. This workshop shall provide a platform to highlight recent advances and future directions towards realistic traffic agent models. Furthermore, this workshop shall provide insights from related fields such as prediction, motion planning and AV safety. Through a mix of invited talks from both academia and industry, paper presentations, and a panel discussion, attendees will be able to catch up with the latest advances, promising directions and most pressing challenges. Attendees will also be able to network in this growing field of research and related areas.

 Workshop on World Models and Predictive Coding in Cognitive Robotics     
   
 Organizers:  Tadahiro Taniguchi, Emre Ugur, Masahiro Suzuki, Dimitri Ognibene, Lorenzo Jamone, Yukie Nagai, Tatsuya Matsushima, Tetsunari Inamura  
 Abstract:  This workshop will explore new frontiers in robotics, highlighting world models, predictive coding, probabilistic generative models, and the free energy principle. The ultimate goal of cognitive and developmental robotics is to create autonomous robots capable of actively exploring their environment, acquiring knowledge, and continuously learning skills. Crucially, to develop robots that learn through interactions with their environment, their learning processes should emulate human cognitive development and learning, which are based on engagement with the physical and social world. This workshop focuses on world models and predictive coding in cognitive robotics. Recently, world models have attracted significant interest in artificial intelligence, as cognitive systems learn these models to improve future sensory predictions and optimize their policies or controllers. In neuroscience, predictive coding posits that the brain constantly anticipates its inputs and adjusts its models to manage dynamics and control behavior in its environment. Both concepts may underlie the cognitive development of robots and humans capable of continuous or lifelong learning. The workshop aims to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners in cognitive robotics to exchange ideas and explore new avenues for the development of autonomous cognitive and developmental robots. This enriching experience will contribute to the growth and advancement of the field of cognitive robotics.

 Thursday-Friday, October 5-6, Two-Day Workshop (By-Invitation-Only)  

 Workshop on Software Engineering for Robotics     
   
 Note:  The workshop is by invitation only and does not require IROS conference registration. If you are interested in attending, please contact the organizers.  
 Organizers:  Claire Le Goues, Sebastian Elbaum  
 Abstract:  The progress in robot development and its impact in the last decade have been astounding. Yet, software engineering techniques and tools have not kept up with this revolution, and in many cases are hindering it. The workshop will bring together thought leaders from academia and industry, in robotics and software engineering, to identify key problems in software engineering for robotics that we should tackle in the next 5 years, and to coalesce a community around those problems. The workshop will produce a roadmap for the community, as well as generate new connections, collaborations, and synergy amongst diverse researchers interested in this problem domain.

  Abstract:    
  Study of chemical/metabolic reaction systems is an interdisciplinary area of research involving understanding of chemical interactions using tools from systems biology, chemical engineering, biotechnology, and chemistry. Models of reaction systems are important for process development and control, optimization and monitoring during production in industries. Hence, it is important to build reliable mathematical models of reaction systems by integrating experimental data. Advances in measurement techniques and process identification methods allow us to build high fidelity dynamical models of reaction systems. Identification of dynamical models of chemical and biological systems is an iterative process involving (i) generating informative data and (ii) fitting a proposed model (or a set of proposed models) to generated data until a reliable model is identified. Kinetic modeling and cybernetic modeling approaches are examples of dynamical models of reaction and metabolic systems. While genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) are commonly available for different organisms including those currently used for industrial applications, building large-scale dynamical models of metabolism describing the intracellular reactions in biological systems is still challenging. Extension of GEMs for dynamic simulations accounting for microbial regulation requires special techniques that enable integrating phenotype and molecular data, e.g., through the cybernetic approach.  
  The objective of this workshop is to introduce systematic approaches for identifying dynamical and steady state models of reaction systems from data and their applications in model-based monitoring, control and optimization of systems through interactive lectures and hands-on practices. The following topics will be introduced in the manner of a tutorial. (1) Modeling of chemical and biological systems using first-principles models and system identification approaches, (2) Dynamic models of biological systems such as dynamic flux balance analysis and cybernetic modeling, (3) Practical structural and parameter identifiability of reaction models from data, and (4) applications of these approaches in process control, estimation and metabolic engineering for biotechnology. The participant will be able to learn theoretical concepts and methods for developing dynamical and steady-state models from experimental data during the lectures and implementation of methods (algorithms) through hands-on sessions. Graduate students, postdocs, senior researchers who are interested in areas of process control, systems biology, chemical reaction networks, nonlinear model identification and their applications can attend this workshop. Basic knowledge of dynamical systems and optimization is adequate to follow the material.

 Abstract:    
  In recent decades, port-Hamiltonian systems have emerged as a useful tool for analysis of interconnected physical systems and control design. The framework emphasises the role of energy and power in system dynamics by highlighting the role of interconnection between components, dissipation and stored energy. As energy and power are common across all domains of physics, the port-Hamiltonian framework provides a unified approach to modelling and control design for multi-domain systems.  
  This one-day workshop will provide an introductory overview of the port-Hamiltonian approach to modelling and control design, as well as expose attendees to some contemporary applications. The workshop is aimed at PhD students and researchers unfamiliar with the topic and is broken into two sessions:  
 Morning session:  Dr. Joel Ferguson and Dr. Alejandro Donaire will introduce the basic principles of modelling and control using the port-Hamiltonian formalism. This session will provide the theoretical foundations of the approach, including many worked examples, and is targeted at PhD students and researchers unfamiliar with the topic.  
 Afternoon session:  Several prominent researchers will give an introduction into emerging methods and applications of port-Hamiltonian systems theory. The covered topics include the unification of energy-shaping and sliding mode control structures, stabilisation controllers for nonholonomic systems, adaptive observers for electro-mechanical systems and applications to networked system. This session is targeted at researchers who are familiar with the basics of port-Hamiltonian or those who attended the morning session.

 Abstract:    
  The objective of this workshop is to introduce participants to concepts, methods, applications, as well as recent advances of data analytics, causality inference, and deep learning techniques for intelligent alarm monitoring in complex industrial facilities. In practice, most real alarm systems suffer from common problems, such as the alarm overloading, missed/false alarms, and alarm flood issues, which severely impair the performance of alarm systems and compromise the safety of system operations. Therefore, intelligent alarm monitoring is of critical importance to the safety and efficiency of process operations in modern large-scale industries. The advanced techniques that will be presented at this workshop are able to detect and reduce nuisance alarms, discover hidden alarm patterns, and identify the root causes based on seamless integration of information from process and alarm databases complemented with process connectivity information.  
  The expected goals are to present recent advances on intelligent industrial alarm monitoring, to demonstrate the applicability and practicality of developed techniques, and to show how alarm management problems can be effectively solved using new tools. More specifically, the emphasis in this workshop will be on how to conduct advanced data analytics to extract useful information from data to help in designing optimal alarm systems, finding out problems, and discovering hidden patterns. This workshop will cover a variety of interesting topics, including the design of univariate/multivariate alarm systems, identification and reduction of nuisance alarms, root cause analysis by causality inference, pattern recognition and deep learning for alarm flood analysis, alarm data visualization, and alarm system performance evaluation. The talks will be accompanied by industrial case studies to convey the practical utility of advanced industrial alarm monitoring tools. Specifically, the topics and speakers of this workshop are as follows:  
  1)  Intelligent Alarm Management Toolbox Developed at the University of Alberta (Dr. Tongwen Chen)  
  2)  Process Analytics Tools for Sensor Data, Alarm Data, and Operator Actions (Dr. Sirish L. Shah)  
  3)  Identification of Nuisance Alarms and Logical Alarm Processing for Safe Plant Operations (Dr. Masaru Noda)  
  4)  Causality and Root Cause Analysis Based on Data Analytics (Dr. Fan Yang)  
  5)  Optimal Design of Industrial Alarm Systems Based on Process Knowledge and Historical Data (Dr. Jiandong Wang)  
  6)  Pattern Recognition and Deep Learning Techniques for Alarm Flood Analysis (Dr. Wenkai Hu)

  Emerging Trends in Resilient Control of Networked Systems     
 Date:  Sunday, 8:30-12:00; 13:30-17:00, 9th July 2023 ( Full-day  Workshop)

 Abstract:    
  Networked control systems are one of the major control paradigms, by virtue of design flexibility, modularity, and scalability. Yet, their modular and interconnected structure that is the source of these benefits can also lead to vulnerability, by allowing local faults to spread to neighboring locations and even to the whole system. This problem is outside the scope of robust and adaptive control, where the controller typically assumes prior knowledge about disturbances affecting the model. This is especially true for adversarial disturbances, which cannot be modeled with confidence and may fatally disrupt a control task at global level.  
  Nonetheless, propagating failures are a crucial issue in several application domains, from multi-robot systems prone to unexpected changes in perceived environment, to vehicular networks dealing with unpredictable behavior of human drivers, to power grids subject to power outages or cyber-attacks. These cases require proactive, resilient strategies that can restore the system functionalities on-the-fly in the face of unexpected or adversarial conditions that fall outside of the design assumptions.  
  Attack-proneness of networked systems has been recently gaining attention in literature, with a huge body of work dealing with cascading failures in vehicular networks, cyber-attacks in smart grids, collaborative multi-robot systems, resilient distributed algorithms. Yet, a unifying framework for resilience in network systems is still lacking, and the complexity of large-scale systems may prevent applicability of several proposed approaches. Ultimately, the path towards resilient networked control systems is still long, and further research and technological effort is needed to cope with adversities of any kind and increasing sophistication.

 Abstract:    
  Controller design faces the challenge of ensuring desired performance and safe operation while managing uncertainties, which can arise from unknown system dynamics, external disturbances, or interactions with unknown entities. Machine learning techniques, like Gaussian processes, can estimate these uncertainties and provide valuable insights.  
  Gaussian processes have gained popularity in the past two decades due to their bias-variance trade-off and connection to Bayesian mathematics. Unlike many methods, Gaussian processes offer a regression function and an uncertainty measure for predictions. This unique feature makes them ideal for various control applications, such as model predictive control, robust control, reinforcement learning, and optimization tasks. The uncertainty measure enables convergence, performance, and safety guarantees. However, incorporating Gaussian processes into closed-loop control systems presents challenges like closed-loop uncertainty propagation and real-time feasible online learning.  
 This tutorial-style workshop aims to introduce the fundamentals of Gaussian processes for modeling and control, highlighting open challenges and opportunities. Experienced experts from academia and industry will cover the basics of Gaussian processes, showcasing their potential for the control community and recent advancements in learning-based control under uncertainties. The workshop targets graduate-level students and experienced theoretical and practical control engineers interested in enhancing their controller design knowledge using Gaussian processes and machine learning.

  Abstract:    
  The last 5 years have seen the emergence of several research groups focused on the use of optimization and Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) methods for the analysis, control, and estimation of systems governed by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). The development of efficient numerical methods for the analysis and control of PDE systems has applications in fields such as drag reduction; controlled nuclear fusion; wind generation; industrial printing; and process control, to name a few. Unlike older, 'lumping'-based work, these newly emerging research groups have focused on using optimization-based tools to design controllers without the use of discretization. As a result, the tools being developed have provable stability and optimality properties. The goal of this workshop is to bring together representatives from each of the newly emerging research groups in order to compare results and propose a vision for the future of this rapidly evolving field.

 Abstract:    
  The framework of cyber-physical systems (CPS) that captures the tight interaction of computational systems with the physical world is believed to carry great promises for analysis and design of systems in many safety-critical industrial applications. Examples of such applications include aerospace, automotive, transportation systems, robotics, chemical process, energy, and healthcare. Within CPS, embedded control software plays a significant role by monitoring and adjusting several physical variables through feedback loops where physical processes affect computation and vice versa. Although CPS have become ubiquitous in modern technology due to significant advances in computational devices, closed-form mathematical models for those complex systems are either not available or equally complex to be constructed. Consequently, one cannot employ model-based techniques to analyze and design this type of complex unknown systems. Hence, data-driven techniques are essential to provide formal analysis for CPS with unknown dynamics.  
  Over the past decade, two types of direct and indirect data-driven techniques have been proposed in the relevant literature for the formal analysis and design of unknown CPS. More specifically, indirect data-driven techniques are those which leverage system identification to learn approximate models of unknown systems, followed by model-based controller analysis approaches. Their advantage is that once the identification phase is achieved, one may rely on the powerful armada of techniques available in model-based control. On the downside, most identification techniques are mainly limited to linear or some specific class of nonlinear systems, and accordingly, acquiring an accurate model for complex systems via those indirect techniques could be expensive. In comparison, direct data-driven techniques are those that bypass the system identification phase and directly employ system measurements for the verification and controller design of unknown CPS.  
  In this workshop, we bring together a number of researchers active in the area of data-driven verification and control of CPS. The contributions will describe recently developed efforts towards new frontiers on the subject. Along with cherishing the exchange of ideas between researchers in the field, we aim to achieve the following goals for the audience attending the workshop:

 Abstract:    
  Control and optimization are two topics that can be traced back the earliest stages of human civilization, have been systematically developed based on rigorous mathematical tools and are widely recognized as the central components of many enabling engineering technologies. There have always been strong interactions between the two areas. The perspectives of dynamics and feedback from control theory have been used for the analysis of optimization algorithms, and optimization methods are promising for performance improvement of control systems. Recent cross-fertilizations between the control systems and artificial intelligence communities have seen a renewed interest in control, optimization and learning for network systems, and indeed have created numerous new research opportunities. This full-day workshop brings together several renowned researchers who will share some of the most recent developments in their respective field, and is aimed to foster further interactions between these closely related exciting research areas.

 Abstract:    
  Data-driven methods have been in use for model order reduction and control for decades. Likewise, data-driven techniques for feedback design are common in adaptive and model predictive control. The unifying idea is to use data to fit or improve a model. With the ever increasing availability of both data and computing resources as well as with the recent trend towards the inclusion of machine learning, data-driven methods have gained new interest and application fields in systems and control. In contrast to the aforementioned, more classic approaches, the recently proposed techniques are often entirely data-driven and, thus, easily applicable based on measurements without any prior knowledge.  
  In this workshop, we bring together experts from the fields of control, data science, and machine learning combining seemingly classical methods with recently developed, data-driven methodologies. Thereby, we aim at understanding underlying patterns and theoretical foundations based on the current state of research and in view of future applications. To this end, we propose a full-day workshop on data-driven predictive control consisting of four parts.  
  The first part is centered around Willems et al.’ fundamental lemma and key extensions addressing, e.g., robustness and stochasticity within the framework of data informativity. In the second part, we are concerned with learning-based control of complex, nonlinear systems. Here, we also recall approximation techniques like extended dynamic mode decomposition within the Koopman framework as well as key concepts from systems and control like incremental dissipativity using also kernel-based approaches. In the third part of the workshop, methods like reinforcement learning and Gaussian-process-based control is considered before the workshop is concluded by a panel discussion, in which we ask, among other questions, whether state-space model are complicating safe data-driven controller design.

 Abstract:    
  The goal of this workshop is to discuss recent advances and research trends in the design of provably robust and resilient autonomy for safety-critical systems. The last decade has witnessed a dramatic increase in the presence of autonomous systems in many domains, including advanced air mobility, autonomous driving, and defense systems. Many of these systems are built using costly hardware and might operate in uncertain and off-nominal environments while interacting with humans and other agents. As potential failures can have catastrophic economic and societal consequences, the reliable deployment of these autonomous systems critically depends on the systems’ robustness and resilience in the presence of uncertain and off-nominal conditions.  
  Ensuring safe, robust and resilient autonomy faces a number of challenges. The broad topics that will be discussed in this workshop include, but are not limited to, (i) robust, adaptive, and learning-based control; (ii) integrated perception, planning, and control under uncertainties; (iii) runtime monitoring, fault detection, and mission (re-)planning; (iv) fast reachability analysis; (v) scalable verification and validation methods; and (vi) platforms and experiments design for robustness and resilience evaluation.  
  The workshop will cover current progress and challenges in developing robust and resilient autonomous systems across different domains spanning from autonomous driving to aerial robots. The exchange among speakers and attendees will help bring attention to this crucial issue of assured and reliable autonomy from different communities that may include control, artificial intelligence, perception, and formal verification. It will also help identify specific key problems and breakthroughs that need to be made in different areas, providing guidelines for related researchers. Finally, we believe this workshop will also be beneficial to administrative people such as policymakers and funding program managers in autonomy by providing background information.

 Abstract:    
  The Encrypted Control Workshop is a one-day IFAC WC workshop focused on Encrypted Control, the recently emerging cryptography-integrated control reconstruction methodology for secure cyber-physical systems. The security threats to cyber-physical systems are increasing by the day; therefore, the importance of control engineering in enabling the safe operation of automation and control systems is growing. Within the field of control engineering, security measures for cyber-physical systems have begun to be more actively discussed in terms of implementing information security (confidentiality, integrity, and availability). This has resulted in several theoretical and practical approaches that have successfully demonstrated the ability to develop secure control systems and improve the detection of cyber-attacks to enhance security. The encrypted control methodology includes the ability to maintain confidentiality and integrity by integrating homomorphic encryption into controller processing. Equally important is supporting the availability of control systems and their security to discuss a next-generation secure control theory. The organizers have invited nine pioneering researchers who are actively working at the forefront of control system security. The workshop will start from the foundations of secure control methodology with the introduction of partially and fully homomorphic encryption and will present recent advances in secure control, such as power system operation using encrypted data, networked robot control, and industrial control. In addition, as a new application study of cryptography, the workshop will introduce verifiable computation, which allows verification of outsourced computation related to the control system. Presenters and session participants will be able to share theoretical and technical security challenges through constructive, multidisciplinary discussions.

 Abstract:    
  The next generation grid will depend heavily on the expansion of the legacy grid, the addition of bulk renewable generation at the transmission level, the interfacing of a distributed energy resource (DER) at the consumer premises with the distribution grid, and the integration of DER energy resources into the wholesale market through aggregators. This trend, called the “Grid at the Edge - GATE”, encompasses an unprecedented need for multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research and new engineering skills and tools. A holistic view is considered by many in the industry and research community largely undefined. The Workshop discussion will focus on defining new practical solutions and fundamental research areas that may lead to new concepts for transmission and distribution management systems and the expansion of the market management systems.  
  The FERC Order 2222 in the USA has paved the way for the DER owners and aggregators to work with the utility and market operators in achieving the reliable and safe operation of the integrated grid. Renewables regulatory framework has also been the focus of the grid development in Japan, Europe, Australia, and other parts of the world for quite some time, and a variety of demonstration projects have been undertaken over the last decade. The Workshop goal is to explore how the use of technology may contribute to integrated grid visibility and controllability, ultimately leading to improved future grid safety, reliability, resilience, and net zero-carbon operation.  
  The Workshop discussions will also address open research questions and the vision of how the advancement in monitoring, control, and protection decision-making tools needs to evolve to meet the future needs of a net zero-carbon integrated grid. By identifying the research gaps, associated barriers, and diverse workforce development, the Workshop participants will also reflect on industry needs for innovative solutions in response to the new societal expectations.

 Abstract:    
  Knowledge of a system model is crucial for many state estimation, signal processing, fault detection, and optimal control problems. The model is often designed to be consistent with the random behavior of the system quantities and properties of the measurements. While the deterministic part of the model often arises from mathematical modeling based on physical, chemical, or biological laws governing the system's behavior, the stochastic part's statistics are often challenging to find by the modeling and must be identified using the measured data. Incorrect description of the noise statistics may significantly worsen estimation, signal processing, detection, control quality, or even failure of the underlying algorithms. The tutorial introduces a more than six decades-long history, recent advances, and state-of-the-art methods for estimating the properties of the noises, including implementation issues. In particular, the estimation of state-space model noise means, covariance matrices, and other parameters are treated.

 Abstract:    
  Micky RAKOTONDRABE presents the use of smart materials, specifically piezoelectric materials, for manipulation. After presentation of classical developments of piezoelectric devices for manipulation, their modeling and control are given in a lecture way, along with measurement/estimation through the self-sensing approach.  
  In her talk, Huichan ZHAO presents existing soft manipulators which are either precisely controlled with multiple degrees of freedom or underactuated but more passive. The former puts a lot of effort into control, while the latter exhibits an inadequate gripping configuration. Huichan Zhao combines the advantages of these two strategies to develop a soft-rigid hybrid gripper with active skin and semi-active endoskeleton. This gripper achieves multiple poses by simply changing the sequential states of endoskeletal joints and successfully grasps various objects in a robust and diverse manner. It combines a simple control scheme and diverse grasping degrees of freedom that facilitates more robust and precise grasping in the areas.  
  The third lecture is by Thibaut RAHARIJAONA. In a world where automation is becoming increasingly prevalent in industry, medicine, and even households, the ability for robots to manipulate deformable objects with precision and repeatability has become a crucial skill. The talk is about a breakthrough implementation of shape control using vision tracking and finite element inverse simulation to bring this capability to reality.  
  Mourad BENOUSSAAD will give the fifth lecture. Physical Human-robot Interaction is a promising and challenging robotics field but requires to be improved to achieve more complex tasks. One of these complex tasks can be a co-manipulation between human and robot of heavy, bulky or flexible object. To consider a certain number of issues related to the interaction stability, safety and human ergonomics and comfort, the human should be considered more deeply as system than just an external perturbation force. This lecture will introduce to physical human-robotics manipulation where the human-object-robot interaction is considered as a whole system, which can be entirely modeled, measured and partially or completely controlled.  
  Gerardo FLORES will introduce to aerial manipulation, i.e. manipulation of objects by using aerial vehicles equipped with manipulators. Such approach to manipulation has several advantages like modularity of the manipulators, large positioning of the object, unlimited size of the object.  
  The final lecture will be given by Sofiane KHADRAOUI. His talk will introduce the modeling of manipulators and the controllers design by considering the challenges raised when manipulating objects: nonlinearities, models uncertainties, objects deformation, sides effects of the environment.

 Abstract:    
  Recent advances in robotics and control systems have motivated a push for long-duration autonomy, where agents are left to operate in uncertain environments for days, weeks, or even months at a time. At the same time, the miniaturization of computer hardware has made the deployment of multi-agent systems for engineering applications economically feasible. These factors have motivated the development of a new framework for the design of autonomous systems: ecologically-inspired robotics. In this tutorial, we will cover the theoretical foundations, software implementation, and several recent case studies that apply the ecologically-inspired robotics framework to control problems. Under this framework, agent interactions, tasks, and safety requirements are embedded as constraints in an optimization problem where each agent minimizes its energy consumption. The resulting agent behavior is interpretable and data-driven; agent actions are determined by the active constraints, and the boundary of the feasible action space is constructed through sensing and communication. Problems in this domain are closely related to control barrier functions and viability theory; many are amenable to real-time algorithms, including quadratic programming. This enables many ecologically-inspired robotics problems to be solved efficiently using modest hardware, and as an added benefit, the resulting system behavior is robust to the addition, removal, and failure of agents during operation. The tutorial will consist of two parts: a series of lectures, and two interactive activities. The organizers will present an overview and motivation for ecologically-inspired robotics, which will be followed by a theoretical overview of the topic and several case studies with implementation details. We will close the tutorial with a coding challenge and experimental demonstration to foster discussion and give attendees the opportunity to apply the framework directly.  
  The program consists of 6 topics: An Introduction to Ecologically-Inspired Robotics, Case Studies in Designing Behaviors as Constraints, Decentralized Control Algorithms and System-Level Convergence, Resilience, Robustness and Adaptivity, a coding tutorial, and a hardware demonstration.

   The 8th IFAC Symposium on System Structure and Control (SSSC) , 17th IFAC Workshop on Time Delay Systems (TDS) , 5th IFAC Workshop on Linear Parameter Varying Systems (LPVS)  , will be held jointly in Montreal, Canada, on September 27-30, 2022. For call for papers see here   . Preliminary program posted, see under Program tab.    
 Initial submission deadline is April 15, 2022   May 9, 2022  . Final Submission Deadline August 31, 2022  . Submission link at Paperplaza  can be found here  . Contributions can be submitted as either an discussion paper (2 pages) or a full paper (8 pages initial submission, 6 pages final submission).  
 The joint conference is planned to be an in-person event, to be held at Sheraton Hotels by Marriott in downtown Montreal between September 27-30, 2022. Please note that the event can be switched to a virtual/hybrid event if the global pandemic conditions do not allow for in-person meetings.  
 The aim of this joint event is to gather academics and professionals with a special interest on system structure, control, linear and nonlinear system theory, and to offer them a forum where to discuss current research developments and open problems as well as to establish scientific networks with a focus on the mathematical structure of systems as well as on the limits it imposes on control systems design and performance.  

 Starting with 2013, the Symposium on System Structure and Control (SSSC) and the Workshop on Time Delay Systems (TDS) take place in the framework of “joint IFAC Conferences”. The novelty of this joint event is that it will include also the Workshop on Linear Parameter Varying Systems (LPVS). The present joint conference aims to achieve the same high quality standard of IFAC. As for the previous editions, the National Organizing Committee (NOC) and the Program Editor are the same for the “joint IFAC Conference” and the registration fees are unique for the whole event, allowing the participants to follow sessions of any of the symposium (SSSC) and workshops (TDS, LPVS). The joint conference is structured across multiple tracks, each of them incorporating several special or regular sessions, poster sessions and industry presentations and demonstrations. The paper proposals will undergo a standard peer reviewing process. Accepted and presented papers will be included in the Conference Proceedings, which will be published in IFAC PapersOnLine.

  11th IFAC Symposium on Fault Detection, Supervision and Safety for Technical Processes - SAFEPROCESS 2022 Pafos, Cyprus, 8-10 June 2022 

 Welcome to SAFEPROCESS 2022  
   
 The Organizing Committee has the pleasure of inviting you to participate in the 11th IFAC Symposium on Fault Detection, Supervision and Safety for Technical Processes, to take place in Pafos, Cyprus, 8-10 June 2022  under the auspices of IFAC, the International Federation of Automatic Control.   
 SAFEPROCESS is organized every three years. The previous edition, was held in Warsaw, Poland in 2018. The SAFEPROCESS Symposium is a major international gathering of leading experts in the academia and industry from all over the worlds. It aims at strengthening the contact between the academia and industry to build up new networks and cultivate existing relations.  
 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertain conditions around the world, the organization of SAFEPROCESS has been transferred from 2021 to 2022, after approval from IFAC. We hope that the change in the dates of the Symposium will facilitate wider participation and the organization of a successful and wonderful SAFEPROCESS 2022, comparable with the high standards of previous SAFEPROCESS events.   
 SAFEPROCESS 2022 will be held physically at the Aliathon Resort in Pafos, Cyprus. Physical participation is strongly encouraged, however to accommodate registrants who are unable to attend the Symposium physically due to the COVID pandemic, SAFEPROCESS 2022 will be held in hybrid mode, thereby allowing virtual participation.

 Welcome to NPC 2022     
   
 The 19 th   Annual IFIP International Conference on Network and Parallel Computing (NPC 2022) will be held in Jinan, China on  September  24-25, 2022.    
   
 The goal of NPC 2022 is to establish an international forum for engineers and scientists to present their ideas and experiences in the field of distributed and parallel computing. NPC is one of the CCF (China Computer Federation) recommended Conferences (C series, Computer Architecture/Parallel and Distributed Computing/Storage System). NPC is also a C recommended conference under the 2021 Core ranking classification system. The proceedings will be published as part of Springer LNCS. NPC 2022 is co-organized by 2022 National Annual Conference on High Performance Computing (CCF HPC China 2022). We will publish extended version of the   top papers from NPC 2022 in a special issue of the International Journal of Parallel Programming (IJPP).   
   
 NPC 2022 is the nineteenth in this series; it builds on the success of eighteen previous events of NPC in Wuhan, China (2004); Beijing, China (2005); Tokyo, Japan (2006); Dalian, China (2007); Shanghai, China (2008), Gold Coast, Australia (2009); Zhengzhou, China (2010); Changsha, China (2011); Gwangju, Korea (2012); Guiyang, China (2013); Taiwan, China (2014); New York, USA (2015); Xi'an, China (2016); Hefei, China (2017); Muroran, Hokkaido (2018); Hohhot, China (2019); Zhengzhou, China (2020) and Paris, France (2021).   

 NPC 2022 is supported by IFIP and the conference is in cooperation with IEEE Computer  Society (pending request), in particular with the Technical Committee on Parallel Processing (TCPP), the Technical Committee on Cloud Computing (TCCLD), the Special Technical Community on Multicore, and the Special Technical Community on Parallel Models and Systems: Dataflow and Beyond. These forms of cooperation started  last year with NPC 2021 in Paris (  https://npc2021.dnac.org/  ).
