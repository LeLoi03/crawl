Similar to previous years, ACML 2023 has two publication tracks  . Authors may submit either to: 
Conference Track: | (16-page limit with references) for which the proceedings will be published as a volume of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research Workshop and Conference Proceedings (PMLR).
 Journal Track: | (20-page limit with references) for which accepted papers will appear in a special issue of the Springer Machine Learning Journal (MLJ).
 Please note that submission procedures for the two tracks are different. Please read the instructions carefully before submitting.   
Conference Track 
Submission Deadline: June 30, 2023  June 23, 2023   For the conference track, please submit your manuscript via CMT at: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACML2023  . 
IMPORTANT:   When creating a new submission on CMT, please ensure you choose the "Conference"  track. 
The Latex submission template and style file can be found here: ACML2023_submission_template.zip  . 
 The Latex camera-ready template and style file can be found here: ACML2023_camera-ready_template.zip  . 
Manuscripts must be written in English, be a maximum of 16 pages (including references, appendices, etc.) and follow the PMLR style. If required, supplementary material may be submitted as a separate file, but reviewers are not obliged to consider this. 
All conference track submissions must be anonymized  . Submissions that are not anonymized, over-length, or not in the correct format will be rejected without review. To anonymize, simply leave the author information empty in the Tex template. There is no separate format for anonymizing. 
It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g., in arXiv) as long as it is not cited in the submission. 
Journal Track 
Submission Deadline: June 02, 2023  May 26, 2023   In addition to the conference track, this year’s ACML will run a journal track, similar to previous years. Papers that are accepted to the journal track must be presented at the conference in order to be published. 
IMPORTANT:   Similar to previous years, for the journal track, the abstract and the paper must be submitted to two different systems simultaneously   for the purpose of review management: 
First, please submit ONLY the title and abstract via CMT at: | https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACML2023. | (paper manuscript need not be submitted here). When creating the submission on CMT, please choose the | "Journal" | track.
 Then, please submit the paper via Springer’s Editorial Manager system at: | https://www.editorialmanager.com/mach. | When creating a new submission on Springer’s Editorial Manager, please make sure to choose | "S.I.: ACML 2023" | as the article type.
 For the journal track, manuscripts must be written in English with a maximum of 20 pages (including references, appendices, etc.). For the template and style files, please follow the instructions for authors on the journal website: https://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10994  . 
The journal track will follow the reviewing process of the Machine Learning journal. This includes allowing papers that require minor changes to be resubmitted after a first-round review. The journal track committee will aim to complete the reviewing process in time for this year’s conference. In the unlikely event that the reviewing process for a paper is not completed in time (for this year’s conference), the paper will not be considered for the conference and the review will be completed as a regular submission to the Machine Learning journal. 
The journal track review is single-blind, i.e., the authors’ identity will be visible to reviewers. It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. Submissions that are not in the correct format will be rejected without review. In addition, extended versions of published conference papers are not eligible for journal track submission. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g., in arXiv).
14. ACML_3 conference:

Some of our participants are unfortunately facing visa challenges  that might prevent them from joining us in person at the conference. We understand the immense effort and dedication it takes to contribute to ACM Multimedia 2023, and we want to reassure everyone that even if you cannot attend in person due to unforeseen circumstances, your paper will still be featured in the conference proceedings. Our team is dedicated to ensuring a fulfilling and enriching experience for all participants, whether they attend in person or online. We will do our utmost to accommodate any challenges and ensure a satisfactory conference experience for all. 
In addition, we’d like to inform you that your paper will be presented in a 2-minute teaser session for those attending in person. For those who may not be able to make it in person, we will also have 2-minute teaser sessions in separate offline sessions to ensure your research receives the attention it deserves.  
We hope to see as many of you as possible, and we thank you for your understanding.

Make sure to book your hotel stay at the Westin Hotel,  Ottawa conference hotel. The hotel  is at the center of the conference activity, and will allow you to network easily with other conference attendees. Also, it’s a quick trip to get to the program and functions, and just as quick to nip back to your room for a break. Staying at the conference hotel will provide a better conference experience! 
Everyone enjoys meeting in a comfortable conference venue, offering quality service and support for workshops, tutorials, plenary sessions, and other activities. As the transaction for those services and support, the conference guarantees that a percentage of attendees will stay in the hotel. The contract with the hotel then guarantees a specific number of sleeping rooms will be used each night during the conference. If the conference does not meet the contracted sleeping room commitment, the hotel gets paid anyway. Those unfilled rooms will cost the conference thousands of dollars. 
Please support ACMMM 2023 and SIGMM by staying at the Westin Hotel!

AAAI-23 Main Technical Track 
Call for Papers 
 All authors must complete a reproducibility checklist, which facilitates replication of the reported research.
 All authors are expected to be available to review (light load), unless extenuating circumstances apply.
 NeurIPS-22 Fast Track: rejected papers with *final, average* scores of at least 4.9 may be submitted directly into AAAI-23’s Phase 2 along with, for example, previous reviews and paper ID.
 The purpose of the AAAI conference series is to promote research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and foster scientific exchange between researchers, practitioners, scientists, students, and engineers across the entirety of AI and its affiliated disciplines. AAAI-23 is the Thirty-Seventh AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. The theme of this conference is to create collaborative bridges  within and beyond AI. Like previous AAAI conferences, AAAI-23 will feature technical paper presentations, special tracks, invited speakers, workshops, tutorials, poster sessions, senior member presentations, competitions, and exhibit programs, and two new activities: a Bridge Program and a Lab Program. Many of these activities are tailored to the theme of bridges and all are selected according to the highest standards, with additional programs for students and young researchers. 
Driven by its disciplinary diversity, AAAI has incubated numerous AI sub-disciplines and conferences and has nurtured for decades the cohesion of AI. New communities often emerge when two or more disciplines come together in order to explore new opportunities and perspectives; today both are plentiful. The purpose of this year’s Bridge Program is to tap into new sources of innovation by cultivating sustained collaboration between two or more communities, directed towards a common goal. Our interpretation of bridge  is broad and encompasses disciplines both within and outside of AI. Hence, the communities that our Bridge Program is intended to bring together could be distinct subfields of AI, such as planning and learning, or different disciplines that contribute to and benefit from AI, such as AI and the humanities. 
We plan for AAAI-23 to be an in-person conference and are exploring opportunities to complement this with remote participation. Given the volatile situation, however, the exact format of the conference can only be decided at a later stage.

ADCOM 2023: Adaptive, Generative and Bio-inspired AI in Computing and Communication  
The Advanced Computing and Communications Society  (ACCS) in association with the Digital University Kerala  announces the 28th annual International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications  (ADCOM 2023) at Maker Village, Kochi during 8th – 10th December 2023. 
ADCOM, the flagship Systems Conference of the ACCS, is a major annual international meeting that draws leading scientists and researchers in computational and communications engineering from across industry and academia. ADCOM highlights the growing importance of Large-Scale Systems Engineering and provides the platform to share, discuss and witness leading edge research and trends. 
ADCOM 2023 explores the current state-of-art AI covering a broad spectrum of adaptive, generative and bio-inspired algorithms and/or hardware useful in computing and communications. Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can create new content, such as text, images, or other media, from scratch. Generative AI models are trained on large datasets of existing content, and then use this data to learn the patterns and rules that govern how that content is created. Generative AI has a wide range of potential applications in Content creation, Data augmentation, Artificial intelligence assistant, Entertainment, Product design etc.

Call for papers  
The ACM MobiCom conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions in the field of wireless networking and mobile computing. MobiCom solicits papers that address important research challenges and build practical working systems. Successful papers should propose novel ideas to attack such problems through rigorous analysis, system design and real-world measurement or deployment of mobile networks, systems and applications. 
 
 MobiCom’23 will emphasize novelty and creativity while, at the same time, taking a broader and more inclusive view of wireless and mobile systems research. On one hand, the more novel the concept, the harder it can be to fully develop or evaluate all its aspects. On the other hand the more practical and developed the system, the more simple and sometimes known techniques must be leveraged. The review process will take both cases into account as intellectual merit and novelty can be found in techniques, system designs, implementations, and applications. The review process will also favor papers that describe how the authors will provide access to well-documented datasets, modeling and/or simulation tools, and codebases to support the reproducibility of their methods as well as papers that highlight and discuss not only the significance but also the limitations of the work. 
 
 Unlike in previous years, MobiCom’23 will not have separate categories of challenge, experience, and verification papers. However, we do encourage the submission of experience papers as full papers that provide detailed technical insight into real-world deployments of novel technologies and systems. MobiCom'23 will also incorporate early notifications for papers rejected in round 1 and rebuttals as described below in more detail.

 Two Deadlines, Early Notification, Rebuttals, and One-shot Revision 

 MobiCom 2023 offers authors the option of two deadlines and keeps the one-shot revision process to enhance the timeliness and quality of the scientific results from the research community. Each paper will go through the same rigorous reviewing process as in previous MobiCom conferences. The review process for each deadline will involve two rounds. Papers that are not selected to proceed after the first round will receive an early notification, including reviews. After the second round of reviews, the reviews will be released to the authors and who will have one week to submit a rebuttal. 
 
 Rebuttals 
MobiCom will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to the final consideration of the papers at the program committee meeting. Authors must limit their responses to (a) correcting factual errors in the reviews or (b) directly addressing questions posed by reviewers. Responses should be limited to clarifying the submitted work. In particular, responses must not include new experiments, new data, or new figures, describe additional work completed since submission or promise additional work to follow. 
 
 The submission of a rebuttal is optional. Rebuttals will be limited to a maximum of 1000 words submitted in the online submission form. It is worth noting that available reviews will be released at the above-mentioned times. However, additional reviews might be solicited or submitted after the rebuttal period. 
 
 Final decisions will be one of the following 

 Accept | : Accepted papers will be presented at the MobiCom conference and appear as part of the proceedings and the MobiCom website. Note all the papers in this category will initially be | conditionally accepted | . The papers that go through a successful | anonymous | shepherding process will eventually be accepted.
 Reject | : Rejected after reviewed papers cannot be resubmitted until 11 months have passed since the last MobiCom deadline they were submitted to. We strongly encourage the authors to address reviewers' feedback before re-submitting the paper to MobiCom.
 One-Shot-Revision | : Papers, where a revision is required, will be given specific action points and can be resubmitted for the | next | deadline. For such papers, the reviewers will articulate a maximum of three major changes/clarifications that they would like to see. After the resubmission, the paper will be evaluated based on whether the authors have properly addressed the reviewers’ requests. Unlike in the shepherding process, the requested action points may include running additional experiments that obtain specific results and could take more than 4-6 weeks. During this revision period, the paper is still considered under review to MobiCom and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration.
 
 Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers 
The authors of accepted MobiCom 2023 papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee that will assess how well the submitted artifacts support the work described in the accepted papers. Participation in Artifact Evaluation is voluntary and has no influence on the paper’s acceptance, but is strongly encouraged. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive badges printed on the papers themselves. Additional details on the Artifact Evaluation process can be found here. 
 
 Submission Instructions 

 All paper submissions will be handled electronically at the MobiCom ’23 paper submission website  . Authors should prepare a PDF version of their full paper. All submitted papers will be evaluated through a double-blind  reviewing process, with the identities of the authors withheld from the reviewers. 
 
 Before final submission, you are expected to make sure that your paper complies with the following requirements. Please do not violate these requirements with the aim of including additional material: ​submissions that violate the formatting requirements may not be reviewed​.  You can visually inspect a page-by-page report of your paper format using the same tool as the submission system via a separate ​ online form  . After the submission deadline, we will use the same tool to check the conformance of papers. The format checking tool uses heuristics and can make mistakes. The PC chairs will manually inspect and possibly reject those papers with evident format violations. However, no paper will be rejected due to format violations without being manually checked. 
 
 Any papers that do not adhere to the following guidelines may be immediately rejected:

  A Cost-Aware Logical Framework  
 Joint work with Harrison Grodin (Carnegie Mellon), Yue Niu (Carnegie Mellon), and Jon Sterling (Cambridge)  
 The computational view of intuitionistic dependent type theory is as an intrinsic logic of (functional) programs in which types are viewed as specifications of their behavior. Equational reasoning is particularly relevant in the functional case, where correctness can be formulated as equality between two implementations of the same behavior. Besides behavior, it is also important to specify and verify the cost of programs, measured in terms of their resource usage, with respect to both sequential and parallel evaluation. Although program cost can---and has been---verified in type theory using an extrinsic formulation of programs as data objects, what we seek here is, instead, an intrinsic account within type theory itself.  
 In this talk we discuss Calf, the Cost-Aware Logical Framework, which is an extension of dependent call-by-push-value type theory that provides an intrinsic account of both parallel and sequential resource usage for a variety of problem-specific measures of cost. Thus, for example, it is possible to prove that insertion sort and merge sort are equal as regards behavior, but differ in terms of the number of comparisons required to achieve the same results. But how can equal functions have different cost? To provide an intrinsic account of both intensional and extensional properties of programs, we make use of Sterling's notion of Synthetic Tait Computability, a generalization of Tait's method originally developed for the study of higher type theory.  
 In STC the concept of a ``phase'' plays a central role: originally as the distinction between the syntactic and semantic aspects of a computability structure, but more recently applied to the formulation of type theories for program modules and for information flow properties of programs. In Calf we distinguish two phases, the intensional and extensional, which differ as regards the significance of cost accounting---extensionally it is neglected, intensionally it is of paramount importance. Thus, in the extensional phase insertion sort and merge sort are equal, but in the intensional phase they are distinct, and indeed one is proved to have optimal behavior as regards comparisons, and the other not. Importantly, both phases are needed in a cost verification---the proof of the complexity of an algorithm usually relies on aspects of its correctness.  
 We will provide an overview of Calf itself, and of its application in the verification of the cost and behavior of a variety of programs. So far we have been able to verify cost bounds on Euclid's Algorithm, amortized bounds on batched queues, parallel cost bounds on a joinable form of red-black trees, and the equivalence and cost of the aforementioned sorting methods. In a companion paper at this meeting Grodin and I develop an account of amortization that relates the standard inductive view of instruction seequences with the coinductive view of data structures characterized by the same operations. In ongoing work we are extending the base of verified deterministic algorithms to those taught in the undergraduate parallel algorithms course at Carnegie Mellon, and are extending Calf itself to account for probabilistic methods, which are also used in that course.

  Machine-checked computational mathematics  
 Geared with increasingly fast computer algebra libraries and scientific computing software, computers have become amazing instruments for mathematical guesswork. In fact, computer calculations are even sometimes used to substantiate actual reasoning steps in proofs, later published in major venues of the mathematical literature. Yet surprisingly, little of the now standard techniques available today for verifying critical software (e.g., cryptographic components, airborne commands, etc.) have been applied to the programs used to produce mathematics. In this talk, we propose to discuss this state of affairs.

  Incorrectness Logic for Scalable Bug Detection  
 Incorrectness Logic (IL) has recently been advanced as a logical under-approximate theory for proving the presence of bugs—dual to Hoare Logic, which is an over-approximate theory for proving the absence of bugs. To facilitate scalable bug detection, later we developed incorrectness separation logic (ISL) by marrying the under-approximate reasoning of IL with the local reasoning of separation logic and its frame rule. This locality leads to techniques that are compositional both in code (concentrating on a program component) and in the resources accessed (spatial locality), without tracking the entire global state or the global program within which a component sits. This enables reasoning to scale to large teams and codebases: reasoning can be done even when a global program is not present. We then developed Pulse-X, an automatic program analysis for catching memory safety errors, underpinned by ISL. Using PulseX, deployed at Meta, we found a number of real bugs in codebases such as OpenSSL, which were subsequently confirmed and fixed. We have compared the performance of Pulse-X against the state-of-the-art tool Infer on a number of large programs; our comparison shows that Pulse-X is comparable with Infer in terms of performance, and in certain cases its fix-rate surpasses that of Infer.

  Probabilistic Programming with Coinductive Data  
 Many stochastic processes can be represented as probabilistically generated coinductive data, produced by programs that utilise a principle of probabilistic corecursion. Mathematically this principle is justified because the categories of deterministic and probabilistic maps enjoy an unusual coincidence of final coalgebras. Based on these observations, I shall present a simple programming language combining recursion, corecursion and probability with a lazy operational semantics. I shall argue that the correctness proof for the operational semantics is most easily carried out in a set theory in which all sets are measurable.

  Synthetic Computability in Constructive Type Theory  
 Mathematical practice in most areas of mathematics is based on the assumption that proofs could be made fully formal in a chosen foundation in principle. This assumption is backed by decades of formalising various areas of mathematics in various proof assistants and various foundations. An area that has been largely neglected for computer-assisted and machine-checked proofs is computability theory. This is due to the fact that making computability theory (and its sibling complexity theory) formal is several orders of magnitude more involved than formalising other areas of mathematics, due to the -- citing Emil Post -- ``forbidding, diverse and alien formalisms in which this [...] work of Gödel, Church, Turing, Kleene, Rosser [...] is embodied.''. For instance, there have been various approaches of formalising Turing machines, all to the ultimate dissatisfaction of the respective authors, and none going further than constructing a universal machine and proving the halting problem undecidable. Professional computability theorist and teachers of computability theory thus rely on the informal Church Turing thesis to carry out their work and only argue the computability of described algorithms informally.  
 A way out was proposed in the 1980s by Fred Richman and developed during the last decade by Andrej Bauer: Synthetic computability theory where one assumes axioms in a constructive foundation which essentially identify all (constructively definable) functions with computable functions. A drawback of the approach is that assuming such an axiom on top of the axiom of countable choice - which is routinely assumed in this branch of constructive mathematics and computable analysis - is that the law of excluded middle, i.e. classical logic, becomes invalid. Computability theory is however dedicatedly classical: Almost all basic results are presented by appeal to classical axioms and even the full axiom of choice.  
 We observe that a slight foundational shift rectifies the situation: By basing synthetic computability theory in the Calculus of Inductive Constructions, the type theory underlying amongst others the Coq proof assistant, where countable choice is independent and thus not provable axioms for synthetic computability are compatible with the law of excluded middle.  
 I will give an overview over a line of research investigating a synthetic approach to computability theory in constructive type theory discussing suitable axioms, a Coq library of undecidability proofs results in the theory of reducibility degrees, a synthetic definition of Kolmogorov complexity, constructive reverse analysis of theorems and synthetic oracle computability.  
 Parts of results are in collaboration with Dominik Kirst, Gert Smolka Felix Jahn, Fabian Kunze, Nils Lauermann, Niklas Mück, and the contributors of the Coq Library of Undecidability Proofs.

  On the exquisite pleasure of doing coinduction and corecursion in Isabelle  
 Coinduction is a powerful technique for defining and reasoning about infinite objects and infinite behaviors. I will show how the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant is a natural home for coinduction. I will illustrate Isabelle's compositional infrastructure for codatatypes, coinductive predicates, and corecursive function definitions. As a working example, I will give a formal proof of the equivalence between Knaster-Tarski greatest fixpoints and provability by infinite proof trees -- which is a foundational result for coinduction in proof assistants. I will also show how Isabelle facilitates the sound mixture of recursion and corecursion.

  Formalizing sphere eversion using Lean's mathematical library  
 Lean's mathematical library mathlib is a rapidly growing unified library of formalized mathematics. The library contains most of the material in a typical undergraduate curriculum, and is used as a basis to formalize many advanced results in mathematics.  
 One such result that I recently formalized together with Patrick Massot and Oliver Nash, is that you can turn a sphere inside out without creasing or tearing it. We formalized this as a corollary of a much deeper theorem in differential topology, the h-principle for open and ample first order differential relations, which is a general technique to find solutions for construction problems.

  Semantic Intermediate Representations for Safe Language Interoperability  
 Designers of typed programming languages commonly prove meta-theoretic properties such as type soundness for at least a core of their language. But any practical language implementation must provide some way of interoperating with code written in other languages -- usually via a foreign-function interface (FFI) -- which opens the door to new, potentially unsafe behaviors that aren't accounted for in the original type soundness proofs. Despite the prevalence of interoperability in practical software, principled foundations for the end-to-end design, implementation, and verification of interoperability mechanisms have been largely neglected.  
 In this talk, I'll advocate a proof technique for ensuring soundness of practical languages, which implement interoperability using glue code that mediates interaction between languages after compilation to a common lower-level intermediate representation (IR). The technique involves building a semantic intermediate representation  : a semantic model of source-language types as relations on terms of the lower-level IR. Semantic IRs can be used to guide the design and implementation of sound FFIs and to verify that the IR glue code used to implement conversions ensures type soundness. I'll conclude with some avenues of future work using semantic IRs as a basis for principled design of language interoperability.

  Three dimensions of compositionality in CompCert semantics  
 Compositional models have been designed for a broad range of language features, but using compositional semantics to formulate and establish compiler correctness theorems remains challenging. In this context, horizontal composition of program components interacts with vertical composition of compiler phases, as both must be compatible with the refinement relation used to formulate compositional semantics preservation.  
 In this talk I will outline how this challenge plays out in the context of the certified compiler CompCert. By borrowing concepts and tools from higher category theory, we can give a systematic account of the way composition principles interact with each other, and give string diagram algebras for various models. I will then explain how the CompCertO model can accomodate spatial as well as horizontal and vertical compositionality, extending its capabilities as a verification framework. This is work in progress with Yu Zhang, Zhong Shao and Yuting Wang.

  Compiling with Call-by-push-value  
 Paul Levy demonstrated that call-by-push-value (CBPV) provides a natural way to decompose both the operational and denotational semantics of call-by-value and call-by-name into more fundamental primitive notions of value and computation type. In this talk we discuss how this same call-by-push-value structure naturally arises in stack-based implementation techniques for compilation of functional programming languages. We show how several standard compilation passes (continuation-passing style, closure conversion) amount to the correctness of Church-encoding in impredicative polymorphic CBPV. Further we relate CBPV to existing calculi for compilation: ANF, Monadic form, SSA, CPS and speculate on potential advantages and disadvantages of incorporating CBPV structure explicitly into compiler intermediate languages.

  Introduction to categorical cybernetics  
 The term “categorical cybernetics” refers to two things: a general theory of categories of optics and related constructions, and a lot of specific examples. These tend to arise in topics that historically were called "cybernetics" (before that term drifted beyond recognition) - AI, control theory, game theory, systems theory. Specific examples of "things that compose optically" are derivatives (well known as backprop), exact and approximate Bayesian inverses, payoffs in game theory, values in control theory and reinforcement learning, updates of data (the original setting for lenses), and updates of state machines. I'll do a gentle tour through these, emphasising their shared structure and the field we're developing to study it.

  Lenses and Dialectica Constructions  
 Dialectica categories were first introduced in my doctoral work to provide an internal characterization of Godel's Dialectica Interpretation. Many years later it was realized that Dialectica category morphisms have the same types as lenses, for a specific definition of lenses. In this short talk, we explain how the motivation for lenses, a special case of bidirectional transformations, in terms of connections of computing systems might suggest uses for dialectica versions of lenses.

  Optics: the Algebra of Monoidal Decomposition  
 Optics have gained popularity in recent years. They appear in differential categories, compositional game theory, bidirectional accessors, process dependency and causality. At the same time, they remain a bit mysterious: why are they so effective? We claim that, apart from their usual monoidal tensor (⊗), optics have a second, hidden, monoidal tensor (⊲). This tensor structure is the crucial ingredient for some applications of optics, but it hides in plain sight because it is non-representable: the tensor of two objects is not again an object, but only a presheaf. Once we can clearly see this second tensor, optics become a non-representable duoidal algebra that is the universal such one over a monoidal category in a precise sense.  
 This talk is based on "The Produoidal Algebra of Process Decomposition", a recent joint work with Matt Earnshaw and James Hefford.

 Speech at the KES 2023 conference  
 September 14, 2023  September 25, 2024      
  
  During the international conference KES 2023 (27th International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information & Engineering Systems), research results on the use of scientific information sources in multilingual Wikipedia on various topics were presented. This year’s edition of the KES conference was organized in Athens (Greece) on September 6-8 in a hybrid mode.   
 For over 22 years, Wikipedia has been edited by volunteers from all over the world. It has over 60 million articles in over 300 language versions. Moreover, in each language version, articles are edited independently. Therefore, differences in the quality of information can be observed between different language versions of this online encyclopedia. However, information included in Wikipedia articles should be based on reliable sources. Generally, this encyclopedia assumes that scientific publications (such as articles, books, monographs) are more reliable sources than others (e.g. social networking services).  
   During the speech, Dr. Włodzimierz Lewoniewski  presented the results of the analysis of over 320 million references in articles in various language versions of Wikipedia. As part of the analysis of information sources, over 10 million references to scientific publications were identified. Using data from DBpedia, Wikidata and Wikipedia projects, the articles were divided into different topics. This allowed to analyze the use of scientific information sources on Wikipedia depending on the topic and language version.  
 The research “Understanding the Use of Scientific References in Multilingual Wikipedia across Various Topics” is supported by the project “ OpenFact  – artificial intelligence tools for verification of the veracity of information sources and fake news detection” (INFOSTRATEG-I/0035/2021-00), granted within the INFOSTRATEG I program of the National Center for Research and Development, under the topic: Verifying information sources and detecting fake news.

 MEDI 2023 CFP     
   
 Overview  
 The Twelfth International Conference on Model & Data Engineering (MEDI) will be held from 2 to 4 November 2023 in Sousse, Tunisia. Its main objective is to provide a forum for the dissemination of research accomplishments and to promote the interaction and collaboration between the models and data research communities. MEDI 2023 provides an international platform for the presentation of research on models and data theory, development of advanced technologies related to models and data and their advanced applications. This international scientific event, initiated by researchers from Euro-Mediterranean countries, aims also at promoting the creation of north-south scientific networks, projects and faculty/student exchanges.  
   
 Why Sousse?  
  Sousse or Soussa (Berber origin) is a city located in northeastern Tunisia. It is the capital of the Sousse Governorate. Located 140 km south of the capital Tunis on the Gulf of Hammamet, the city has 280 000 inhabitants. The present city has grown to include the ruins of Hadrumetum, which had many names in several languages during antiquity. Its economy is based on transport equipment, processed food, olive oil, textiles and tourism.  
 The city is host to many international conferences and other important regional and international events. We have chosen Sousse to host the MEDI-2023 for its exoticism and modernity. The facilities for hosting conferences in the city have evolved, especially in terms of hotels and conference centers.  
  
 Medi 2023 will be Organized in Hotel Sousse Pearl Marriott Resort & Spa 5*  , Sousse- Tunisia  
 Sousse Pearl Marriott Resort & Spa is conveniently located within walking distance (01 Km) of the city's oldest area. It is also just a few steps away from all the main tourist attractions.

 Abstract.  
 Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) provides a huge body of knowledge of automation for many different engineering tasks, especially those involving transitioning from design to implementation. With the huge progress made on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, questions arise for the future of MDE such as how existing MDE techniques and technologies can be improved or how other activities which currently lack dedicated support can also be automated. However, at the same time, it has to be revisited where and how models should be used to keep the engineers in the loop for creating, operating, and maintaining complex systems. To trigger dedicated research on these open points, we discuss the history of automation in MDE and present perspectives on how automation in MDE can be further improved and which obstacles have to be overcome in the medium and long term perspective.

 Bézivin coined the term Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) in 2005 as follows: “ MDE is a software engineering methodology which uses formal models, i.e., models which are machine-readable and processable, to semi-automatically produce executable software systems  ” (Bézivin, 2005  )  . The main idea behind formal models  is to provide abstractions of software systems to manage their complexity. Based on these abstractions, as they are machine-readable and even processable, automation techniques  are provided, e.g., to generate executable software (Schmidt, 2006  )  , which was the main focus 20 years ago in the pioneering phase of MDE. However, soon, other automation concerns emerged and have been studied, such as analysing models by transforming them into formal domains such as model checkers. Model-to-model transformations have been used for this purpose. For code generation, model-to-code transformations have been developed to automate the transition from design models to code-based implementations. To complete the picture, code-to-model transformations have been used for reverse engineering of existing software systems such as legacy systems. A comprehensive study on different transformation intents is provided in (Lúcio et al .  , 2016  )  .  
   
 For developing automation support in terms of transformations, major research efforts have been spent on developing model transformation languages as it has been soon realized that transformations are complex software systems themselves (Sendall and Kozaczynski, 2003  )  . In parallel, language engineering approaches based on metamodeling techniques have been emerging, which allow for the efficient and effective development of modeling languages and accompanying modeling tool support such as model editors, validators, and storage facilities (Atkinson and Kühne, 2003  )  . Having these infrastructures enabled the development of domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) (Chen et al .  , 2005  )  in addition to general-purpose modeling languages such as UML.  
   
 By having abstractions as models combined with automation support, the promise of MDE is to allow engineers to focus on the problem domain, i.e., which systems should be realized, rather than on the solution domain, i.e., how the system is realized. However, to realize this promise, several challenges have to be tackled as reported over the years in several papers. In (France and Rumpe, 2007  )  , the authors discuss challenges associated with modeling languages, e.g., how to engineer DSMLs, achieving separation of concerns to deal with complexity, and model manipulation/management mostly supported by transformations. In (Mussbacher et al .  , 2014  )  , the authors discuss how MDE may be used even beyond software, raising the need for interdisciplinary modeling support, e.g., for socio-technical systems. The latter requires model integration and consistency support as well as strong tool support. Finally, in a more recent work (Bucchiarone et al .  , 2020  )  , the authors discuss important aspects of MDE such as foundational, social, community, domain, and tool aspects. However, we are not aware of any report focusing explicitly on the automation aspect of MDE and how this aspect will develop towards 2030. It is important to close this gap as with the recent and expected advances of AI, the current automation techniques and technologies of MDE are highly impacted as well and new ones may be developed to support additional tasks in the software engineering process which are not targeted by existing technologies. Thus, a discussion on the role of models, MDE methodologies, and engineers in this new era is required to frame the potential future of MDE.  
   
 Important questions have to be answered, such as which phases can be additionally automated, e.g., should we directly go from natural language requirements to code, or is there still, especially because of the enhanced AI capabilities, a sweet spot for using models in such highly automated processes? Can we now ease and automate the modeling process itself and reach at the same time a higher automation degree in the synthesis process, such as code generation? These questions are important for the foundations of MDE, but at the same time, also for recent application areas such as low-code/no-code development (Ruscio et al .  , 2022  )  and digital twin engineering (Tao et al .  , 2018  )  .  
   
 In the following, we capture the achievements of automation in MDE by enumerating prominent engineering activities which have been in the focus of automation as well as the automation techniques which have been applied for achieving the automation. Based on this foundation, we lay out several challenges hindering further significant automation increases and conclude the paper with perspectives on tackling these challenges until 2030.  

 2.  Achievements in Automation  
 2.1.  Targeted Automation Activities  
 In this section, we categorize and discuss the activities that have been targeted for automation within the MDE field, organizing them according to the categories outlined in the contents for a Model-Based Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (Burgueño et al .  , 2019  )  .  
   
 2.1.1.  Model Quality Management  
 Significant efforts have been made to automate activities for finding defects, faults and failures in models and modeling processes. Numerous model validation and verification techniques exist that automate quality checks, such as correct syntax, semantics, structure, behaviour, etc., of models to ensure that any inconsistencies or errors are detected and rectified at the model level and as soon as possible. For instance, model checking has been automated through algorithms that check the temporal behaviour of a software or system model against certain properties or specifications, ensuring they meet specified requirements or constraints, and there are numerous languages and mature tools available (Holzmann, 2004  ; Bengtsson et al .  , 1995  ; Kwiatkowska et al .  , 2011  )  .  
   
 Automated testing techniques based on models (a.k.a. model-based testing) have been developed, too, where models are used to generate test cases automatically (e.g., (Pretschner et al .  , 2005  )  ). Traditionally, this method has helped identify potential problems early in the development process, significantly reducing cost and effort in the testing phase. Moreover, in recent years, model-based testing automation has gained relevance due to the rise of digital twins (Bickford et al .  , 2020  )  , which impose the need for streamlining testing, and the adoption of new development methodologies such as agile, continuous development, integration and delivery (Jongeling et al .  , 2019  )  where the process of executing test cases and analyzing the results, often in a continuous integration / continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that needs to be automated.  

 2.1.2.  Model-based execution  
 For testing, debugging or analysis, executable models and simulation facilities are necessary. Regarding executable models (Kleppe et al .  , 2003  )  , executable UML models are popular, which usually use an action language to define the behaviour of the system (e.g., the Alf Action Language (alf, 2017  )  , SOIL (Schäfer and Gogolla, 2020  )  , or FUML 1  1  1  https://www.omg.org/spec/FUML     ).  
   
 Over the years, the automation of model-based execution, simulation, and co-simulation has seen numerous advancements, moving from manual processes that required human intervention—e.g., to set up simulations and adjust parameters based on expert knowledge and observations—to highly automated processes and tools. For instance, there has been the standardization of an Action Language as part of the OMG UML Specification for the execution of UML models (alf, 2017  )  and tools for simulation such as Modelica 2  2  2  https://modelica.org     , which are widely used by system engineers. There is also available a series of interpreters for modeling languages, both graphical and textual, many of them fully integrated into modeling environments, e.g., see (Gogolla et al .  , 2007  )  .  
   
 Furthermore, there have been efforts to come up with model execution support by developing dedicated interpreters for domain-specific modeling languages, e.g., see initiatives such as GeMOC (Globalization of Modeling Languages) 3  3  3  https://gemoc.org     focusing on the development of technologies and methodologies to generate dedicated execution \hyp  oriented tools for models such as model testing and debugging capabilities based on the defined operational semantics of the modeling languages.  

 2.1.3.  Model Transformations  
 Model transformations constitute a fundamental aspect of MDE and serve as the backbone for automating the transition from high-level abstractions to executable code, simulations, or other models. They can be classified into Model-to-model transformations (M2M), Model-to-text (M2T) transformations, and Text-to-model (T2M) transformations (Kleppe et al .  , 2003  )  . M2M transformations are perhaps the most exploited automation and automated activity in MDE, where, among other uses, models are automatically transformed into executable code in various programming languages. M2T transformations provide the ability to autogenerate code from models, contributing significantly to software development automation. The models serve as the primary artifact; from them, code, documentation or other textual artifacts (such as JSON files) are generated automatically (Klein, 2015  )  . T2M transformations are used for reverse-engineering code into models as well as other purposes such as documentation generation (Wang et al .  , 2010  )  .  
   
 At the same time that model transformations have enabled and pushed forward automation in software engineering, they have also been the target of automation. This automation leverages specific languages, execution engines, tools, and frameworks, as described below. One of the primary means of automating model transformations is through dedicated transformation languages. These languages provide constructs tailored to describe how model elements must be mapped to their equivalent elements. Examples of such languages include ATL (Jouault et al .  , 2008  )  , QVT (OMG, 2005  )  , ETL (Kolovos et al .  , 2008  )  , and Henshin (Arendt et al .  , 2010  )  to name just a few—for a survey see (Kahani et al .  , 2019  )  .  
   
 Transformation engines 4  4  4  https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.mmt.qvt-oml     5  5  5  https://wiki.eclipse.org/ATL/EMFTVM     (Burgueño et al .  , 2016  ; Cuadrado et al .  , 2022  ; Tisi et al .  , 2013  )  are specialized software components that execute the transformation rules defined in a transformation language against source models to generate target models. These engines manage the complexities of navigating model structures, applying transformation rules, resolving dependencies, and ensuring the integrity of the generated models. Transformation engines can be standalone tools or integrated into broader MDE platforms, providing a seamless experience from model editing through to transformation.  
   
 For automation to be truly effective, model transformations must be well-integrated with the software development environment. This includes providing user-friendly interfaces for defining and managing transformations. Such integration enables developers to incorporate model transformations seamlessly into their workflows, automating repetitive tasks, and facilitating more agile and iterative development processes. Some efforts include the Epsilon Playground (Kolovos and García-Domínguez, 2022  )  and AToMPM (Syriani et al .  , 2013  )  among others.  

 2.1.4.  Model Management  
 Model management involves different activities, which we discuss in the following. Automated model evolution  involves strategies for evolving models to reflect changes in requirements or design. Automation can be achieved through predefined transformation rules or templates that apply changes across models, ensuring consistency and reducing manual effort. Languages such as those that conform to Epsilon (Kolovos and García-Domínguez, 2022  )  or ATL (Jouault et al .  , 2008  )  support automated transformations that facilitate model evolution.  
   
 When metamodels evolve, models that conform to those metamodels may become invalid and need to be adapted to remain consistent with the new version of the metamodel (Herrmannsdoerfer and Ratiu, 2009  )  . Automated model migration  is needed to update models. So far, this has been achieved in numerous ways, for instance, by means of model transformations (Sprinkle and Karsai, 2004  ; Ruscio et al .  , 2012  )  or with dedicated languages such as Epsilon Flock (Rose et al .  , 2014  )  .  
   
 Maintaining models  to ensure their accuracy and relevance over time can be automated through continuous integration tools that integrate model changes, run automated validations, and report inconsistencies or errors. Automated testing frameworks for models also contribute to maintenance by ensuring that model updates do not break existing functionalities.  
   
 Since models are software artifacts, version control systems are beneficial to keep up with current development needs. Given the different nature of models w.r.t. code, approaches to deal with models are needed. For instance, EMFStore (Koegel and Helming, 2010  )  or Connected Data Objects (CDO) 6  6  6  https://www.eclipse.org/cdo     provide automated support for model versioning  .  
   
 Automated model diffing tools  compare and identify differences between model versions. EMF Compare 7  7  7  https://eclipse.dev/emf/compare     is an example of a tool that provides automated support for model comparison, highlighting differences and conflicts within models developed using EMF (Eclipse Modeling Framework) 8  8  8  https://eclipse.dev/modeling/emf     .  
   
 Merging model  changes, especially in collaborative environments or when reconciling parallel development efforts, require sophisticated automation to handle conflicts and ensure model integrity. Tools like EMF Compare 9  9  9  https://eclipse.dev/emf/compare     also support automated model merging by providing strategies and user interfaces to resolve conflicts and integrate changes from different model versions seamlessly.  
   
 Refactoring models  is the process of restructuring the model while not modifying its original functionality or behaviour. This process can be automated using model transformation languages and refactoring libraries. Tools and frameworks, such as Epsilon (Kolovos and García-Domínguez, 2022  )  or EMF Refactor (Arendt and Taentzer, 2012  )  ,provide automated support for model refactoring.  

 2.1.5.  Modeling  
 Last but not least, the task of modeling itself, i.e., creating models as abstractions of software and systems, has also been the target of automation. In particular, specific efforts have been put into approaches for model generation (Saini et al .  , 2022  )  , model search (López and Cuadrado, 2020  )  , model completion (Chaaben et al .  , 2023  )  and model classification (Nguyen et al .  , 2019  )  . Among other efforts, a long-lasting line of work to automate the execution of models has been heavily addressed by researchers working on models@runtime (Bencomo et al .  , 2019  )  , where the models of a system need to be up-to-date while the system is running at the same time that is used to adapt the runtime behaviour.  

 2.2.  Automation-Enabling Techniques  
 From the very beginnings of MDE, automation emerged as a fundamental pillar. Numerous works have employed direct approaches based on heuristics to automate or semi-automate certain activities directly on the models’ representations. Other works have relied on established automation technologies to achieve this automation. In the remainder of this section, we discuss four families of these technologies: formal methods  , search-based techniques  , extensional and intensional knowledge engineering approaches  , and artificial intelligence  .  
   
 2.2.1.  Formal Methods  
 Due to their rigor and precision, formal methods have been utilized for specifying, analyzing, and verifying various artifacts in MDE. The literature is abundant with contributions on the application of formal methods for automating various MDE tasks. However, we limit ourselves to a few examples of their most common uses.  
   
 The first family of applications targets the analysis and verification of UML models. This involves techniques such as model checking (Hilken et al .  , 2018  )  , constraint satisfaction problem solving (Ehrig et al .  , 2009  )  , Boolean satisfiability (Soeken et al .  , 2010  )  , and rewriting logic (Durán, 2022  )  . Another family of application of formal methods concerns the generation of models for metamodel or transformation testing. Here again, a variety of techniques have been explored, including typed graph transformation (Anastasakis et al .  , 2010  )  , equivalence partitioning (Cabot et al .  , 2007  )  , and satisfiability modulo theories (Semeráth et al .  , 2020  )  , to name a few. A third noteworthy family, although few works have covered it, is model completion. Its automation is achieved, for example, through first-order logic using Alloy (Sen et al .  , 2010  )  . Formal methods have also been applied to define the operational semantics of modeling languages, e.g., by using Maude and graph transformations (Rivera et al .  , 2009a  ; Engels et al .  , 2000  )  . Formal methods have also been employed for model versioning (Westfechtel, 2014  ; Taentzer et al .  , 2014  )  , including diffing and merging, which have been managed in terms of graph modifications and graph transformations.  

 2.2.2.  Search-based Techniques  
 These techniques have emerged as valuable tools for automating various activities of MDE. This line of research views the automation of many MDE tasks as optimization problems, which can be effectively tackled using search-based methods (Boussaïd et al .  , 2017  )  . One of the earliest applications of this concept was in the domain of model transformations, particularly using examples of input-output models. Researchers utilized search-based techniques for model diffing based on refactoring detection (Kessentini et al .  , 2017  )  , model merging (Mansoor et al .  , 2015  )  , and to perform model transformations (Kessentini et al .  , 2008  )  and even to learn transformation rules (Faunes et al .  , 2013  ; Baki and Sahraoui, 2016  )  .  
   
 Moreover, search-based techniques have been instrumental in generating test suites to validate these transformations. Test cases, often in the form of input-output models, are generated to ensure the correctness of the transformations (Jilani et al .  , 2014  )  . Additionally, model samples play a crucial role in testing metamodels. Search-based techniques have been employed to either generate those model samples (Gómez et al .  , 2012  )  or to perform model selection (Batot and Sahraoui, 2016  )  to ensure the robustness and effectiveness of metamodels. In cases where metamodel descriptions lack well-formedness rules, these rules can be recovered from examples of both valid and invalid models. Genetic programming techniques have been utilized for this purpose, aiding in the refinement of metamodels (Batot and Sahraoui, 2022  )  .  
   
 Another significant application of search-based techniques in MDE is the repair of modeling artifacts. The evolution of metamodels can invalidate many associated artifacts due to their dependency on the type systems defined within the metamodels. Evolutionary algorithms have been employed to repair models (Kessentini and Alizadeh, 2022  )  , OCL constraints (Batot et al .  , 2017  )  , and model transformations (Kessentini et al .  , 2018a  )  . Similarly and independently from the evolution, search-based approaches have been used to repair errors in MDE artifacts such as transformations (VaraminyBahnemiry et al .  , 2021  )  .  
   
 In the realm of design space exploration (DSE), where finding the best design instance for a given problem is challenging, search-based techniques have proven invaluable. DSE, framed as an optimization problem, involves exploring alternative models to identify those that meet specific criteria (Abdeen et al .  , 2014  )  .  
   
 The relation between MDE and search-based techniques is also a tale of cross-fertilization. Indeed, MDE contributed to enriching search techniques through improved encoding of optimization problems and their subsequent resolution, e.g., (Denil et al .  , 2014  ; Burdusel et al .  , 2018  ; John et al .  , 2023  ; Bill et al .  , 2019  )  .  

 2.2.3.  Extensional and Intensional Knowledge  
 The automation or semi-automation of a task requires knowledge that can be operationalized through software tools. This knowledge may include elements that enable the direct execution of the task. It can also be exploited within a complex automation process. In the context of MDE, knowledge often appears extensionally in some kind of repositories, particularly in the form of sets of artifacts such as models (Robles et al .  , 2017  )  or transformations 10  10  10  https://eclipse.dev/atl/atlTransformations     . It can also be intentionally represented, typically through ontologies.  
   
 Among the artifacts within MDE, model sets have been extensively leveraged to provide support in modeling tasks. These collections of models are employed via search engines to propose models or model fragments aligning with specific criteria articulated by modelers, either in textual or pre-defined partial model forms (Bislimovska et al .  , 2014  ; López and Cuadrado, 2022  ; Basciani et al .  , 2018a  )  .  
   
 The alternative category of knowledge, termed intensional, integrated into MDE task automation, encompasses ontologies. These structures provide organized descriptions of real-world objects, which can be utilized for crafting domain-specific languages or models (Staab et al .  , 2010  )  . Due to their inherent semantics, ontologies also serve in model verification and debugging processes (Mokos et al .  , 2010  ; Walter et al .  , 2014  )  , or for model matching (Kappel et al .  , 2006  )  . Additionally, ontologies can be harnessed through design patterns to automate the creation of meta-models or models (Atkinson and Kühne, 2003  ; Pescador and de Lara, 2016  )  .  
   
 Lastly, the integration of extensional and intensional knowledge can enhance automation efforts. For instance, ontologies can streamline search requests and responses within model repositories (Robles et al .  , 2012  )  .  

 2.2.4.  Artificial Intelligence  
 Like many other disciplines, AI has been extensively used as an automation technology for MDE. From the early days of MDE until now, rule-based systems have been employed to automate model transformations, utilizing either general-purpose rule languages such as NéOpus (Revault et al .  , 1995  )  or specifically dedicated ones like ATL (Jouault et al .  , 2008  )  . Soon after, the notion of supporting modelers in writing transformation rules emerged. In this regard, machine learning techniques were applied to derive transformation rules from examples using supervised learning (Varró and Balogh, 2007  )  or unsupervised learning (Dolques et al .  , 2009  )  .  
   
 More recently, with advancements in machine learning research, considerable effort has been dedicated to assisting in metamodeling and modeling activities. This includes the utilization of techniques such as GNNs (Di Rocco et al .  , 2021  )  and LSTM (Weyssow et al .  , 2022  )  . Furthermore, research has been focused on model transformations using reinforcement learning (Eisenberg et al .  , 2021  )  and LSTM architectures (Burgueño et al .  , 2022  )  . Various machine learning algorithms have also been applied for metamodel classification (Nguyen et al .  , 2019  )  and model classification (López et al .  , 2022  )  , as well as for model repair (Barriga et al .  , 2022  )  and model generation (López et al .  , 2022  )  . However, these initiatives often face challenges due to the difficulty of training machine learning models, particularly given the scarcity of data.  
   
 The remarkable power of LLMs has partially alleviated this problem. Thus, it became possible to automate several modeling tasks with little or no training data. However, the effectiveness of using LLMs for this purpose varies, as Camara et al. (Cámara et al .  , 2023  )  highlight. Ben Chaaben et al. explored the application of LLMs for static and dynamic domain-model completion (Chaaben et al .  , 2023  )  . Model generation with LLMs has also garnered significant interest among researchers, encompassing diverse model types such as goal models (Chen et al .  , 2023a  )  and static domain models (Chen et al .  , 2023b  )  .  

 2.3.  Mapping between Activities and Enabling Technologies  
 The aim of this subsection is to present a mapping between the previously presented modeling activities and the enabling technologies. This mapping does not intend to be exhaustive by any means but wants to present illustrative examples. Table 1   11  11  11  Since a metamodel is a model (in particular, a model of a model), some of these activities apply to both models and metamodels. For the sake of brevity, we only refer to models.    shows activities in its rows and technologies in its columns (the column “Direct” contains examples of approaches providing automation support directly for the model representations without moving to an already existing automation space). Each cell contains a maximum of two exemplary works, appended with a ‘+’ if the state of the art is more extensive and includes further works. Cells with only one work mean that we could not find more examples for that activity and technology. Empty cells mean that we could not find any example.

 Table 1.  Overview of MDE activities and enabling technologies.   Table 1   12  12  12  The table is inevitably nonexhaustive and merely intended to reflect the kinds of activities and supporting approaches available.    gives a partial summary of how automation-enabling technologies have been used for various MDE tasks. As we can see, a range of techniques, including direct programming, formal methods, and search methodologies have been extensively employed to automate various MDE tasks. To a lesser extent, the MDE community have leveraged, on the one hand, model sets and ontologies and, on the other hand, other AI techniques to automate some distinct activities. On another note, in recent years, there has been a surge in interest and adoption of deep learning-based approaches for MDE, albeit their widespread use has been hindered by the scarcity of large-scale datasets for model training or refinement.  
   
 The utilization of Language Model-based systems and other cutting \hyp  edge technologies in this realm is still in its nascent stages. To date, the primary focus has been on model generation and completion tasks within MDE workflows. Nonetheless, this landscape presents numerous untapped research avenues for further exploration and refinement of deep learning approaches in MDE.  
   
 To capitalize on these opportunities, there is a pressing need to prioritize the creation of expansive datasets tailored specifically for MDE tasks, as highlighted in Section 3   . By doing so, researchers and practitioners can unlock the full potential of deep learning methodologies in automating and enhancing various tasks of MDE.  
   
 Looking ahead, LLMs are poised to become a pivotal research domain in automating MDE tasks. However, their application extends beyond mere model generation or completion tasks. There exists a vast scope for creative exploration and utilization of LLMs in diverse MDE activities, heralding a new era of innovation and efficiency in software engineering practices.  

 3.  Perspectives and Challenges  
 Building upon the introductory concepts discussed earlier, this section provides an overview of perspective topics that hold significance in the medium to long term for automation in MDE. We foresee a vast potential for automation within MDE, driven by advancements in AI, particularly in generative AI and LLMs. In exploring the future prospects of MDE and its automation possibilities, it is crucial to acknowledge the challenges ahead. Challenges include integrating automation tools, ensuring compatibility, and maintaining interoperability among diverse modeling languages and environments. Additionally, developing intuitive modeling tools and addressing ethical considerations in interdisciplinary domains pose significant problems to be investigated, as discussed below. The distinction between perspectives and challenges may not always be clear-cut and may overlap. While discussing envisioned advancements, we see some of them as potential obstacles for automation that must be overcome.  
   
 Management of ever-increasing diversity of languages and tools:  MDE has seen a proliferation of domain-specific modeling languages and tools, which has led to a diverse range of technologies. However, this diversity has posed challenges for generic  automation as each modeling language has its own syntax, semantics, and transformation rules. Despite efforts to standardize syntax, the MDE field still needs comprehensive standards, especially concerning semantics, transformation rules, and model interchange formats. Moreover, the rise of low-code/no-code platforms makes this issue even more difficult as adherence to existing standards becomes increasingly sporadic. Thus, it is imperative to develop standardized interfaces, transformation mechanisms, and model interchange formats to ensure interoperability and tooling support across different formalisms, languages, and paradigms.  
   
 Combination of symbolic and non-symbolic AI  : Integrating symbolic AI techniques, such as logic reasoning and rule-based systems, with non-symbolic approaches, such as neural networks and deep learning, offers opportunities for enhancing automation in MDE. By leveraging the complementary strengths of both paradigms, researchers can develop hybrid AI systems that excel in tasks requiring both symbolic reasoning and pattern recognition. For example, combining symbolic reasoning with neural networks enables MDE tools to interpret and manipulate models based on logical constraints while leveraging the scalability and flexibility of neural networks for data-driven tasks or even exploiting generative AI tools to synthesize models that are domain or context-aware.  
   
 Emancipation from formal languages with LLMs  : Creating domain-specific modeling languages is a crucial undertaking that involves collaboration between different roles, including language and domain experts. This collaborative effort encompasses various steps, including developing concrete syntaxes, the definition of formal semantics, and the construction of supportive modeling environments. However, the language development process can be challenging, often necessitating refinement of language definitions to refine user requirements or address unforeseen ones. LLMs offer a promising option for the early evaluation of languages by specifying their semantics in natural language and facilitating early analysis and stakeholder interactions to validate whether the language aligns with user requirements.  
   
 Template-based code generation vs. AI-based code generation  : While template-based methods provide transparency and control over the generated code, AI-based approaches offer adaptability and potential for optimizing code generation based on diverse requirements and contexts. Researchers can develop code-generation techniques by exploring hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of both paradigms.  
   
 Model management automation with AI approaches  : AI-driven techniques can enhance model management processes by improving semantic understanding and context-aware manipulation of models. By leveraging AI for tasks such as model differencing, merging, and versioning, MDE can achieve greater efficiency and reliability in managing evolving model artifacts. For example, AI algorithms can analyze the semantics of models to detect and resolve (or propose how to resolve) conflicts during model merging, thereby reducing manual effort and potential errors in model integration.  
   
 Moving from general LLMs to task-specific AI agents:  In the traditional context of MDE, a platform typically denotes a particular technology stack or execution environment. However, with the increasing adoption of LLMs, the platform concept expands to encompass a collaborative ecosystem of multiple language models operating together within a multi-agent system. Specifically, we foresee a paradigm shift towards the widespread adoption of task-specific AI agents driven by LLMs. These specialized agents are designed to execute various model management tasks, such as model evolution, comparison, domain modeling, training and test data generation, and model completion (Hong et al .  , 2023  )  .  
   
 Orchestration of automated MDE tasks  : The application of modeling concepts and tools involves executing different tasks, including model transformations, validation, and code generation. To this end, despite the availability of domain-specific languages like Wires (Rivera et al .  , 2009b  )  , there is still the need for higher-level automation strategies that, starting from user requirements, can coordinate low-level automated tasks and that are flexible to accommodate different modeling languages, tools, and environments. Additionally, achieving a seamless integration of automated processes requires addressing compatibility issues and ensuring interoperability between different automation tools and frameworks.  
   
 Democratizing the usage of task-specific AI agents:  To enable the usage of task-specific AI agents, it is necessary to devise low-code platforms that empower users to leverage task-specific AI agents seamlessly. Such platforms can facilitate broader participation in MDE activities across domains and expertise levels by providing intuitive interfaces for coordinating diverse AI models. Moreover, low-code platforms can serve as orchestrators for deploying and managing AI agents, allowing users to customize and extend automation capabilities according to their specific requirements and preferences.  
   
 Combination of physical/biological/social/software aspects in complex systems:  Integrating physical, biological, social, and software aspects into the same system presents a multifaceted challenge that requires a comprehensive approach to modeling and abstraction. MDE stands as an ideal integration vehicle for managing these heterogeneous aspects by providing a unified framework for representing and analyzing complex systems. Digital twins, which are virtual replicas of physical entities or systems, offer a powerful abstraction mechanism for simulating and analyzing the behavior of interconnected systems. By leveraging digital twins, MDE can facilitate the design and optimization of integrated systems across diverse domains, ranging from healthcare to sustainable smart cities.  
   
 Emergence of non-traditional interface devices  : Integrating speech interfaces, gesture recognition, and other non-traditional input modalities in MDE tools can democratize software development by enabling a broader range of stakeholders to participate in modeling activities. By providing intuitive and accessible interfaces, such as voice commands or touch-based interactions, MDE tools can lower the barriers to entry for users with diverse backgrounds and abilities. Moreover, non-traditional interface devices facilitate collaboration and communication among distributed teams, allowing users to interact with models in real time and co-create solutions collaboratively. To this end, interdisciplinary work at the intersection of human-machine interaction and software engineering research fields will be needed (Kashfi et al .  , 2019  )  .  
   
 Feedback-driven MDE:  MDE tools and processes will need built-in feedback mechanisms. This feedback could come from engineers, stakeholders or the system itself (i.e., in the form of real-time data) and could be sporadic or continuous. Tools, processes and teams should not disregard feedback. New methodologies to work in a new environment where automated feedback integration are needed, too. A straightforward scenario is Digital Twins. For instance, Digital Twins can be used for product development, where design and engineering teams can investigate a broader range of design possibilities early in the development, saving money, resources and time. In such a scenario, the engineering processes must be adapted to collect and react to the outputs/feedback received by the Digital Twin, and engineering teams must have methodologies put in place.  
   
 Automated and semi-automated decision-making in MDE:  As software and systems grow in complexity and the demands for faster delivery increase, automating decision-making processes becomes needed to improve efficiency and quality. On a purely technical level, automated decision-making will help choose the best transformation languages, model checkers, AI algorithms, execution models, etc. Furthermore, it would ensure that decisions are made consistently throughout the life of a project and by different teams. It would also prevent human error in repetitive decision-making processes (e.g., tools enhanced with automated support could exploit data and human-defined objectives to make or suggest optimal decisions).  
   
 Scarcity of datasets and benchmarks for AI models:  The advancement of AI-driven automation in MDE is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating AI models. Unlike domains like natural language processing or computer vision, where large-scale datasets are readily available, MDE lacks comprehensive datasets that capture a diverse range of modeling tasks and application domains (López et al .  , 2024  )  . Moreover, concerns regarding data privacy and the ethical use of data further complicate the acquisition and sharing of modeling datasets. Addressing these challenges requires collaboration between researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders to curate datasets, define evaluation metrics, and establish best practices for data collection and sharing in MDE contexts (Rocco et al .  , 2015  )  .  
   
 The advent of LLMs presents new opportunities for dataset creation in various domains. With the ability to generate human-like text and simulate expert knowledge, LLMs offer a cost-effective alternative to traditional human labeling methods. For instance, LLMs can automatically generate labeled datasets for MDE tasks such as model classification or sentiment analysis. Additionally, LLMs can serve as judges to evaluate the quality and accuracy of tasks performed by other LLMs, thereby facilitating continuous improvement and refinement of AI-driven systems.  
   
 Better modeling tools:  Despite significant advancements in modeling tools, many existing tools in MDE are tailored towards expert users and lack intuitive interfaces for non-specialists. This poses challenges for automation and democratizing the adoption of MDE methodologies across diverse domains and user communities (Ruscio et al .  , 2022  )  . Improving the accessibility and usability of modeling tools requires incorporating user-centered design principles, conducting usability studies, and providing comprehensive documentation and training materials. Additionally, ensuring compatibility and interoperability between different modeling tools and environments is essential for facilitating seamless collaboration and exchange of models among users with varying expertise levels.  
   
 Teaching people how to prompt:  Despite the advancements in AI and automation, human expertise remains indispensable in designing complex systems and formulating effective prompts for AI models. Teaching people how to prompt effectively involves imparting knowledge and skills in understanding system requirements, defining clear objectives, and structuring prompts to elicit desired responses from AI models. Thus, human expertise is essential for ensuring the accuracy, relevance, and ethical considerations of AI-generated outputs.  
   
 Teaching MDE:  Given the rapid evolution of technology and MDE, teaching MDE needs to be adapted to the fast-evolving needs. Educators must prepare students not just to be proficient modelers, but to be architects of highly complex software and systems that leverage automation and MDE techniques to meet the demands of industry and society. Incorporating new technologies in teaching MDE can significantly improve the learning experience. For instance, the use of simulation tools, multidimensional visualization software, and other interactive applications can provide a more immersive and engaging learning experience.  
   
 (Self-)Adaptation and coexistence with physical components:  Using abstractions to automate the generation and adaptation of software will narrow the gap between the digital and physical worlds. This will have an important application to domains such as IoT, CPS or Digital Twins. Technical, security, and standardization objectives need to be defined and pursued to make MDE up to the current needs.  

 4.  Conclusion  
 MDE has proven its utility over time, primarily due to its remarkable capabilities in abstraction and automation. These features have significantly streamlined the development process, from conceptualizing ideas to their implementation. This article delves into the various facets of MDE activities and the diverse technologies that have been deployed to automate these activities.  
   
 The evolution of MDE is closely intertwined with the emergence of cutting-edge technologies, such as deep learning and large language models. These advancements have revolutionized automation in MDE activities, paving the way for enhanced efficiency and effectiveness in software development. In addition to offering extraordinary automation capabilities for MDE, these emerging technologies create new opportunities for this paradigm to play new roles in development processes. One significant aspect to consider is the democratization of AI techniques. The power of abstraction and automation provided by MDE allows non-specialists to leverage AI capabilities seamlessly. This democratization can lead to more widespread adoption of advanced technologies and contribute to innovation across industries.  
   
 Moreover, MDE’s potential extends beyond traditional software development. It can be leveraged to build complex and hybrid systems that integrate physical, biological, social, and software components. Such systems are becoming increasingly crucial in modern societies, where interconnectedness and integration are paramount.

 The International Conference on Model-Based Software and Systems Engineering provides a platform for participants from all over the world to present research results and application experience in using model-based techniques for developing all sorts of systems. Model-based software engineering has emerged over many years as an approach for developing IT systems in which models take a central role, not only for the analysis of these systems but also for their construction. More recently, a similar approach has become increasingly widely used not only for software systems, but also for physical, cyber-physical and business systems. This model-based software and systems engineering approach relies on an increasingly rich ecosystem of techniques, languages and tools. MODELSWARD is an opportunity for researchers and practitioners alike to come together and discuss, moving this ecosystem forward.

 The purpose of the International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering and Software Development is to provide a platform for researchers, engineers, academics as well as industrial professionals from all over the world to present their research results and development activities in using models and model driven engineering techniques for Software Development. Model-Driven Development (MDD) is an approach to the development of IT systems in which models take a central role, not only for analysis of these systems but also for their construction. MDD has emerged from modelling initiatives, most prominently the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) fostered by the Object Management Group (OMG). In the scope of MDA, a couple of technologies have been developed that became the cornerstones of MDD, like metamodelling and model transformations. MDD relies on languages for defining metamodels, like the Meta-Object Facility (MOF) and Ecore (developed in the scope of the Eclipse Modelling Framework), and transformation specification languages like QVT and ATL.

 ABOUT Conference  Welcome to CODS-COMAD Dec’24  
 CODS-COMAD is a premier international conference focusing on scientific work in Databases, Data Sciences and their applications. Being held for the 8th time as a common conference bringing together the COMAD and the CODS communities, this conference invites researchers in the field of databases, data sciences and their applications to submit their original work.  
 The conference has a long and rich history. COMAD, primarily a data management conference, started in 1989. CODS started in 2014 with AI, Machine Learning and Data Science as its focus.These merged in 2018 to become the vibrant CODS-COMAD conference of today. The current conference is marked by keynote talks by stalwarts, research and applied data science tracks presenting original work of high quality, topical tutorials and demo tracks showcasing innovation in action. The Young Researchers Symposium has evolved as a valued forum for providing early feedback to budding and early career researchers. The conference consistently attracts funding from top research labs, and other data-centric companies and startups. This sponsorship enables providing support to students from across the country to attend the conference. Since 2021, the conference has been hosting a track on Diversity and Inclusion to promote this crucial aspect in the data science and databases community. In short, the conference has been striving to bring the data-centric community together, specially in India, and also more generally around the world.  
 CODS-COMAD Dec’24 will be hosted by IIT Jodhpur  
  during 18-21 December, 2024.

 DEAR ICMI COMMUNITY,   
  We are thrilled to have to welcome you in-person in Paris  .  
 The 25th International Conference on Multimodal Interaction (ICMI 2023) will be held in Paris, France. ICMI is the premier international forum that brings together multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) and social interaction research. Multimodal AI encompasses technical challenges in machine learning and computational modeling such as representations, fusion, data and systems. The study of social interactions englobes both human-human interactions and human-computer interactions. A unique aspect of ICMI is its multidisciplinary nature which values both scientific discoveries and technical modeling achievements, with an eye towards impactful applications for the good of people and society.  
  We are keen to showcase novel input and output modalities and interactions to the ICMI community. ICMI 2023 will feature a single-track main conference which includes: keynote speakers, technical full and short papers (including oral and poster presentations), demonstrations, exhibits, doctoral spotlight papers, and late-breaking papers. The conference will also feature workshops and grand challenges. The proceedings of all ICMI 2023 papers, including Long and Short Papers, will be published by ACM as part of their series of International Conference Proceedings and Digital Library, and the adjunct proceedings will feature the workshop papers.   
 The theme for this year’s conference is “ Science of Multimodal Interactions  ”. As the community grows, it is important to understand the main scientific pillars involved in deep understanding of multimodal and social interactions. As a first step, we want to acknowledge key discoveries and contributions that the ICMI community enabled over the past 20+ years. As a second step, we reflect on the core principles, foundational methodologies and scientific knowledge involved in studying and modeling multimodal interactions. This will help establish a distinctive research identity for the ICMI community while at the same time embracing its multidisciplinary collaborative nature. This research identity and long-term agenda will enable the community to develop future technologies and applications while maintaining commitment to world-class scientific research.

 Workshop on  
  Multimodal, Interactive Interfaces for Education   
 Welcome to the site web of the ICMI 2023 International Workshop on Multimodal, Interactive Interfaces for Education  , part of the 25th ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction   .  
     
 Overview  
 From tablets to augmented reality, from virtual avatars, to social robots, multimodal, interactive interfaces emerged as interesting tools to facilitate learning in educational scenarios by improving the engagement and the motivation of students towards the learning activities. Research has also shown the potential of such technologies as convenient instruments for the personalization of teaching strategies to the learning styles of each student, proposing appropriate feedback and adapted levels of difficulty in a wider set of learning activities. Such kind of tailoring might become a new, particularly helpful resource to meet the demands of students with special needs.  
 The development and the adoption of such interfaces in educational scenarios relies on new pedagogies and new didactics co-designed in an interdisciplinary effort involving engineers, psychologists, cognitive scientists, educators, students, and families.  
 The aim of this workshop is to provide a venue for all the involved stakeholders to present scientific advances on the design, the development, and the adoption of multimodal, interactive interfaces for education, fostering discussions, ideas and interdisciplinary collaborations between researchers on the domain as well as industrial partners.  
 Program  
 The workshop will be held in October 13th, 2023  . Keynotes and contributor’s presentations will be video recorded and made available via a dedicated YouTube channel  .  
  Proceedings are available at https://doi.org/10.1145/3610661  .

 Artificial Companions  – Session chairs: Barbara Bruno and Sozic Gauthier 
 9:05 | How could poor interactions produce learning effects?   
  Pierre Dillenbourg – Computer-Human Interaction for Learning and Instructions Lab, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland   
  Invited talk  – Planes don’t flip their wings, but humanoids in education tend to (badly) imitate human roles, teachers, tutees or co-learners. The interactions that a learner may have with a robot are very poor as compared to the interactions with a human. If the richness of interactions does not justify the use of robots, can we creatively use HRI bottleneck as opportunities to invent novel learning situations. To explore this question, we need to start from the mechanisms by which somesocial interactions may, in some conditions, produce learning.

 Reading comprehension interfaces  – Session chairs: Salvatore Anzalone and Chenyang Wang 
 11:00 | Developing and implementing a digital scale for the assessment of literacy Skills (EECL) within the Francophone School Board (CSF) in British Columbia : issues, methods and uses   
  Denis Alamargot – Institut National Supérieur du Professorat et de l’Éducation de l’Académie de Poitiers, Université de Poitiers, France   
  Invited talk  – Interactive interfaces emerged as interesting tools to facilitate learning in educational scenarios. Thus, it is now possible to take advantage of digital tools to offer new environments for assessing students’ reading and writing skills, in order to provide teachers and practitioners with new kinds of student learning profiles, based on scientific evidences. It is to respond to this request, as made by the Francophone School Board (CSF) of British Columbia in Canada, that we develop, in close collaboration with teaching teams and computer developer teams, a « literacy skills assessment scale » (EECL) based on a series of interactive tests, developed on iPad and streaming students’ performance in a centralized database. To date, as deployed, the EECL makes it possible to test nearly 3,000 students each year from kindergarten to the 3rd year of primary school and offers longitudinal monitoring of students, conducive to the adjustment of pedagogical and remediation practices. The objective of this conference is to explain, in addition to the interest of the digital interface for the implementation of the EECL, the method used to mobilize teaching teams and develop the use of this digital tool at the level of a school board of nearly 6,500 students in 47 schools throughout British Columbia.

 13:30 | Shared Gaze Visualizations in Education   
  Bertrand Schneider – Harvard Graduate School of Education, Harvard University, Cambridge, US   
  Invited talk  - In this talk, I will discuss the use of synchronized eye-trackers for understanding and supporting remote interactions between students and teachers. This kind of intervention, called Shared Gaze Visualizations (SGVs; D’Angelo & Schneider, 2021), has been found to significantly augment communication, coordination, and overarching collaboration within a dyadic group - which improves learning and teaching. Additionally, I will describe how SGVs are theoretically grounded and offer opportunities to better understand the underlying dynamics of social learning by modeling collaboration from the dual eye-tracking data (e.g., Schneider & Bryant, 2022). I will conclude with thoughts on future work (for example, on the need for better and more intuitive tools for designing SGVs) and how SGVs can be extended to a variety of new technological platforms (e.g., AR/VR headsets). In summary, this talk will make the case that seamless integration of SGVs with advanced technologies can significantly enhance remote learning, which would be crucially needed in case of another pandemic.

 Develop Players  – https://www.develop-players.com/   
  Mariagrazia Benassi   
  Develop Players is the first cognitive enhancement video game platform for kids with SLD and ADHD. All applied games proposed by Develop-Players are founded on three characterizing elements: a scientific model based on years of research, the personalization of the intervention thanks to the detailed analysis of the cognitive profile of each user, and the possibility of the use of the game independently. In fact, the use of advanced machine learning algorithms allows our games to adapt the difficulty of the game level to the user’s abilities, thus enabling a gradual and effective growth path that would otherwise be impossible. All Develop-Players video games are based on validated scientific research and must pass numerous tests in order to ensure maximum effectiveness and reliability.  
   
 Leka  – https://leka.io/

 Welcome to CNSM 2023  
 It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2023 edition of CNSM, the International Conference on Network and Service Management. CNSM is the annual Fall event of the network management community, co-sponsored by its technical committees, namely the IFIP working group 6.6 on Network and Distributed Systems Management and the IEEE Communications Society Committee on Network Operations and Management.  
 This year we are celebrating the 19th edition of this event and its 14th since the merger in 2010 of what used to be a forum of co-located workshops, a.k.a. Management Week, into a highly selective single‐track conference. Niagara Falls was then home to this merger, and back we are 13 years later, steps away from the majestic Horseshoe Falls.  
 CNSM 2023 program builds on the timely and overarching topics of AI and digitalization under the theme of network and service management in the Era of Generative AI and Digital Twins. The 3-day main program features a total of 8 plenary technical paper presentation sessions, a line-up of 5 compelling keynotes from academia and industry, a panel discussion among experts in the field, as well as posters and demonstrations. A mini conference and the 3rd International Workshop on Analytics for Service and Application Management precede the main conference program for focused and scoped technical discussions.  
 CNSM 2023 would have not been possible without the tireless efforts of the organizing and technical committees and the contribution of the authors and the reviewers. We are most grateful to them and to our patrons, sponsors and supporters. We hope that you will enjoy CNSM 2023 technical and social programs in Niagara Falls.

 The 31st IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP 2023)  
 Reykjavik, Iceland  
  October 10-13, 2023  
  https://icnp23.cs.ucr.edu/index.html   
 ICNP, the IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols, is the premier conference covering all aspects of network protocol research, including design, analysis, specification, verification, implementation, and performance. ICNP 2023 will be held in Reykjavík, Iceland between October 10-13, 2023.  
 Scope  
 The conference is soliciting paper submissions with significant research contributions to the field of network protocol  research. Both experimental studies as well as formal investigations are equally welcome. Topics traditionally of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 All aspects of network protocol research including design, specification, verification, implementation, measurement, testing, and analysis. 
  Protocols for cellular networks, data center networks, Internet of Things, sensor networks, social networks, software-defined networks, vehicular networks, and wireless networks. 
  Domain-specific solutions, including protocols for network security, routing, user privacy, and network management. 
  Network protocols meet AI/ML, e.g., application of AI/Machine Learning to improve network protocols and operations; networking and protocols for improving the performance of AI/Machine Learning systems. 
  Contributions to network architecture, e.g., algorithms and protocols for network virtualization or future Internet architectures. 
  Contributions to other areas of data communications to the extent that they articulate a strong connection to network protocols, for example by discussing potential implications on the design or performance of certain types of network protocols. 
  Authors who are unsure whether or not their submissions might fit the scope of the conference are welcome to contact the Program Committee Co-Chairs. .  
 Paper Formatting  
 Paper submissions should adhere to the IEEE Conference formatting requirements using the templates available here  , and should not exceed 10 pages excluding  references. It is the authors’ responsibility to produce readable submissions that comply with the formatting constraints. Violating the formatting requirements to squeeze in additional materials will result in a submission being returned without being reviewed.  
 Submission and Anonymity Policy  
 Papers submitted to the conference will be reviewed through a double-blind review process, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers (and that of the reviewers from the authors). Achieving this goal requires some care to, on the one hand, preserve the anonymity of your submission, and on the other hand ensuring proper coverage of related past work, including your own. While this requirement may seem challenging, the few basic steps listed below will go a long way towards achieving the desired outcome.  
 Remove all authors’ identifiers, e.g., names, emails, and affiliations, from the title page. 
  Remove acknowledgments of and identifiers of funding sources. 
  Use anonymous names for your files, as source file names are often embedded in the final output you generate, and therefore accessible as comments. 
  When referring to your own related work, refer to it in the third person as you would with any other related work by another author. 
  Besides anonymizing your submission, double-blind reviewing also imposes additional requirements on both authors and reviewers. Specifically, while it is permissible for authors to give local talks on their work and release their paper on a non-peer-reviewed location, e.g., an institutional repository or even arXiv, care should be exercised to limit public exposure as much as possible. This requirement includes refraining from advertising the work on mailing lists and public forums, and in general limiting as much as possible the odds that program committee members be exposed to the work and the authors’ identity. Conversely, program committee members will be advised to neither actively seek to “reverse engineer” the authors’ identity, nor to directly share with other program committee members any such information they may have acquired. All questions regarding possible breaches of the anonymity covenant that underlies the double-blind review process will be adjudicated by the Program Committee co-Chairs.  
 All papers will be provisionally accepted and the final acceptance of any paper will be subject to shepherding by a member of the program committee.  
 Submission and Plagiarism Policy  
 Papers must present original contributions and can neither be previously published nor under review by another conference or journal. Papers containing plagiarized materials will be subject to the IEEE plagiarism policy  and possible penalties and will be rejected without being reviewed.  
 Best Paper Award and Fast-Track Journal Publication  
 One of the accepted papers will be selected for the Best Paper award, and will be fast tracked to the IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, with a streamlined journal review process.  
 Presentation and Registration Requirements  
 ICNP 2023 will be held physically in-person in Reykjavík, Iceland. IEEE ICNP requires that at least one of the authors of any accepted paper must register for the conference at the full rate and be available to present the paper at the conference. Any paper that is not presented by an author of the paper will be withdrawn from the proceedings and thus from IEEE Xplore.

 A deep learning classifier is proposed for grading hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in neonates. Rather than using handcrafted features, this architecture can be fed with raw EEG. Fully convolutional layers were adopted both in the feature extraction and classification blocks, which makes this architecture simpler, and deeper, but with fewer parameters. Here, two large (335 h and 338 h, respectively) multi-center neonatal continuous EEG datasets were used for training and testing. The model was trained based on weak labels and channel independence. A majority vote method was used for the post-processing of the classifier results (across time and channels) to increase the robustness of the prediction. A dimension reduction tool, UMAP, was used to visualize the model classification effect. The proposed system achieved an accuracy of 86.09% (95% confidence interval: 82.41–89.78%), an MCC of 0.7691, and an AUC of 86.23% on the large unseen test set. Two convolutional neural network architectures which utilized time-frequency distribution features were selected as the baseline as they had been developed or tested on the same datasets. A relative improvement of 23.65% in test accuracy was obtained as compared with the best baseline. In addition, if only one channel was available, the test accuracy was only reduced by 2.63–5.91% compared with making decisions based on the eight channels. Full article

 Handbook of global optimization  Panos Pardalos    
 2002  
 In 1995 the Handbook of Global Optimization (first volume), edited by R. Horst, and PM Pardalos, was published. This second volume of the Handbook of Global Optimization is comprised of chapters dealing with modern approaches to global optimization, including different types of heuristics. Together (available as a set, set ISBN 1-4020-0742-6), the two volumes of the handbook cover a complete and broad spectrum of approaches for dealing with global optimization problems. The goal of the editors is to provide a true handbook ...

 Advances in Global Optimization: Methods and Applications  Panos M Pardalos    
 Many deterministic minimization algorithms can be seen as discrete dynamical systems coming from the discretization of first or second order Cauchy problems. On the other hand, global optimization can be considered as an over-determined Boundary Value Problem (BVP) for these problems. For instance, the steepest descent method leads to the following BVP:

 Introduction to Global Optimization  Leo Liberti    
 2006  
 Accurate modelling of real-world problems often requires nonconvex terms to be introduced in the model, either in the objective function or in the constraints. Nonconvex programming is one of the hardest fields of optimization, presenting many challenges in both practical and theoretical aspects. The presence of multiple local minima calls for the application of global optimization techniques. This paper is a mini-course about global optimization techniques in nonconvex programming; it deals with some theoretical aspects of nonlinear programming as well as with some of the current stateof-the-art algorithms in global optimization. The syllabus is as follows. Some examples of Nonlinear Programming Problems (NLPs). General description of two-phase algorithms. Local optimization of NLPs: derivation of KKT conditions. Short notes about stochastic global multistart algorithms with a concrete example (SobolOpt). In-depth study of a deterministic spatial Branch-and-Bound algorithm, and con...

 Proceedings of the XIII Global Optimization Workshop: GOW'16  Ana Maria A.c. Rocha    
 2016  
 Large scale problems in the design of networks and energy systems, the biomedical field, finance, and engineering are modeled as optimization problems. Humans and nature are constantly optimizing to minimize costs or maximize profits, to maximize the flow in a network, or to minimize the probability of a blackout in the smart grid. Due to new algorithmic developments and the computational power of computers, optimization algorithms have been used to solve problems in a wide spectrum of applications in science and engineering. In this talk I am going to address new challenges in the theory and practice of optimization. First, we have to reflect back a few decades to see what has been achieved and then address the new research challenges and directions.

 A survey on the global optimization problem: General theory and computational approaches  Francesco Archetti    
 Annals of Operations Research, 1984  
 Several different approaches have been suggested for the numerical solution of the global optimization problem: space covering methods, trajectory methods, random sampling, random search and methods based on a stochastic model of the objective function are considered in this paper and their relative computational effectiveness is discussed. A closer analysis is performed of random sampling methods along with cluster analysis of sampled data and of Bayesian nonparametric stopping rules.

 Keynotes  

 Smart IoT Sensing for Ageing Well: Research Activities and Future Directions  
 Michael Sheng, Macquarie University  
 Worldwide, the population is aging due to increasing life expectancy and decreasing fertility. The significant growth in older population presents many challenges to health and aged care services. Over the past two decades, the Internet of Things (IoT) has gained significant momentum and is widely regarded as an important technology to change the world in the coming decade. Indeed, IoT will play a critical role to improve productivity, operational effectiveness, decision making, and to identify new business service models for social and economic opportunities. Indeed, with the development of low-cost, unobtrusive IoT sensors, along with data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, there is now a significant opportunity to improve the wellbeing and quality of life particularly of our older population. In this presentation, we will overview some related research projects and also discuss several research directions.  

 Algorithms and Systems Enabling AI for Science  
 Geoffrey Fox, University of Virginia  
 Currently, AI and in particular deep learning plays a major role in science, from data analytics and simulation surrogates to policy and systemdecisions. This role is likely to increase as ideas from early adopters spread across academic fields. We can group the structure of "AI for Science" into a “handful” (≤10) of patterns and we need to explore examples of each pattern, possibly leading to “Foundation” models for each of them. We suggest examining each pattern and supporting it with high-performance, easy-to-use environments for end-to-end systems, including data engineering. This would cover parallelism, storage and data movement, security, and the user interface. We illustrate this with the Cylon system which is HPC Software for Data Engineering.  

 Toward Next-Generation Supercomputer Systems: Vision and Activities in Japanese HPC Community  
 Masaaki Kondo, Keio University  
 The supercomputer Fugaku began its operations in 2021 and has successfully produced many useful scientific and engineering results. The use of a high-performance computing systems such as Fugaku is essential as a digital twin platform that reproduces physical space on cyberspace for the realization of future smart society. There is a growing demand for the development of next-generation supercomputer systems with higher performance supporting wider range of applications. However, there are many technical challenges towards development of next generation systems as we are now facing the end of Moore's law. Hence we launched a community activity for Next-Generation Advanced Computing Infrastructure (NGACI) in 2019 to discuss the roadmap of future HPC platforms, technical challenges, and necessary R&D elements. We have also started a feasibility studies on next-generation supercomputing infrastructures this year as a part of a national project by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) Japan. This talk introduces these activities and reviews recent trends in the development of supercomputing systems beyond exascale.  

 Digital Convergence  
 Michael Resch, High Performance Computing Center Stuttgart  
 The world of High Performance Computing is undergoing major changes. The coming end of Moore’s law has triggered attempts to push the limits of hardware which has resulted in an increasing usage of accelerator technologies. With these new systems a new user community has arisen. Artificial Intelligence has seen a spectacular comeback over the last years. While Artificial Intelligence and High Performance Computing seem to be rather different in their requirements and targets we see the evolution of what we want to call Digital Convergence. Users increasingly rely on both HPC and AI to solve their problems. This is further supported by a tremendous increase in data available for research. This talk will discuss the options and challenges that the new Digital Convergence creates.

 AfricaCrypt is an annual international conference on cryptology. AfricaCrypt 2023 is co-organized by The university of Monastir and the Tunisian Mathematical Society in cooperation with the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR). The aim of AfricaCrypt 2023 is to provide a forum for practitioners and researchers from industry, academia and government from all over the world for open discussion on all aspects of cryptography and its applications.  

 We are organizing a poster session co-chaired by Abderrahmane Nitaj (abderrahmane.nitaj(at)unicaen.fr) and Hoda Alkhzaimi for showcasing research results including work in progress. The authors will get a 7-minute time slot to present their work in a poster session and posters will be on display in the coffee break room for the duration of the conference. We invite all researchers to submit their ongoing projects, challenges dealt with in their research domain and prospective new research directions that are in line with the theme of the conference.  

 The submissions will go through a light review process co-chaired by Abderrahmane Nitaj and Hoda Alkhzaimi. It is not a requirement that submissions need to be previously unpublished. There are no proceedings for posters, so the poster will not count as a publication. For a poster to be presented and displayed, at least one of its authors must attend the conference.

    Pairing-based Cryptography 

  Pair­ing-based Cryp­to­graphy  

 Pairings are bilinear maps that enable the realization of several cryptographic primitives. Pairing-based cryptography offers approaches for numerous interesting problems, such as  
 Attribute-based cryptography 
  Anonymous group signatures and reputation systems 
  Fine-granular access control systems (Anonymous Credential Systems) 
  Pairing-based cryptography was first known and utilized in the field of identity-based cryptography. Identity-based cryptography deals with special asymmetric encryption and signature schemes. In identity-based schemes, the public key can be directly derived from the owner's identity. For example, this would allow you to encrypt an email using a key locally derived from the recipient's email address. Hence there is no need for the usual process of contacting a central key authority to retrieve the recipient's public key. Instead, the key authority is used to generate the private keys, with the added benefit that it only has be contacted once by every user. Since the key authority generates all private keys in such a system, it represents an especially lucrative target for malicious attacks.  
 In our group, we develop new schemes in the field of pairing-based cryptography. Furthermore, we analyze implementations of such schemes with respect to efficiency and security  .  

  At­trib­ute-based Cryp­to­graphy  

 Development of so-called functional encryption schemes is one of the main visions of modern cryptography. These encryption schemes should overcome the main disadvantages of conventional encryption schemes, namely that data is encrypted for a certain addressee and the access to the encrypted data is all or nothing. In the context of functional encryption schemes, every user receives a secret key which is parameterized with a certain function according to the access rights of the user. The data is encrypted only once and the user learn only the evaluation of their function on data and not necessarily the data themselves. While in general it is difficult to even just define the security requirements for this kind of encryption schemes, efficient encryption schemes for different restricted classes of functions are known. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a special case of functional encryption.  
 An attribute-based system requires a central authority which sets the system up and provides the user with their secret keys. In key-policy ABE (KP-ABE), the owner of data defines a subset of predefined attributes for data and encrypts it once using this set. In order to access the encrypted data, every user in the system receives a user secret key provided with an access policy according to the rights of the user. The key policies are Boolean formulas over predefined attributes. A user will be able to decrypt a ciphertext if and only if the attributes of the ciphertext satisfy the policy of his/her key. For ciphertext-policy ABE (CP-ABE) the roles of attributes and policies are reversed. That is, the data is encrypted under an access policy and the keys are provided for sets of attributes. Systems based on ABE have to model the access rights of the user in terms of attributes and access policies depending on concrete scenarios and concrete access pattern.  
 In our example, the manager of Map Data Center wants to ensure fine-grained access control to the road maps for its customers (routing services). Therefore, restricting access to the full data base, to the maps of continents, and to the maps of each single country will be realized. Each map is encrypted once with an appropriate policy. For example, the map of Germany's roads is encrypted with the policy "World OR Europe OR Germany". Every customer who gets a key with one of the attributes "World", "Europe", or "Germany", will be able to decrypt the appropriate ciphertext and obtain access to Germany's road maps. Thus, the access control is managed by the encryption itself.  

  An­onym­ous Group Sig­na­tures and Repu­ta­tion Sys­tems  

 In standard signature schemes, the sender computes a signature  on his message using his secret key. The receiver can check, using the signature and the sender's public key, that the message was indeed composed by the sender and that it was not modified in transit. To achieve this, the public key must uniquely identify the sender. However, in many scenarios this strict identification is not necessary or even desirable. Whenever an application only needs assurance that the sender belongs to a certain group  of possible senders, anonymous group signatures  can be used.  
 Anonymous group signatures allow each member of a group to sign messages without disclosing their identity. For this, each group member gets their own private key that is associated to the group's public key. In contrast to standard digital signature schemes, the message receiver can only check whether some  group member signed the message, but not which specific member did it. The actual signer can only be determined by a special entity in the system (the group manager  ).  
 Besides anonymity, other properties of group signatures play an important role in some applications. For example, it may be useful to restrict the number of messages that each group member can sign. Furthermore, techniques for revoking group membership are important. In particular, these and other extensions of group signatures can be used to construct anonymous reputation systems  .  
 Reputation systems are an important tool to allow customers and providers of goods and services to gather useful information about past transactions. In order to receive trustworthy, reliable, and honest ratings, a reputation system should guarantee the customer anonymity and at the same ensure that no customer can submit more than one rating. Of course the ratings should be publicly verifiable by third parties.  
 Some of the required properties for reputation systems are already known for group signatures. Some, however, are not. For example, a reputation system does not consist of a single group, but rather there is a group for each rateable product (or service). For the security of reputation systems these different groups cannot be analyzed in isolation.  
 The goal of this research area is the extension of group signature schemes and the construction of anonymous reputation system on the basis of group signatures.  

  An­onym­ous Cre­den­tial Sys­tems  

 How can you assure a pharmacist that you have a prescription without revealing your identity? How can you show your driver's license without revealing your name? Such scenarios can be realized with anonymous credential systems. In such systems, users obtain credentials that certify attributes. With a credential, a user can access certain resources or services without revealing his identity. For this, he needs to prove that he is in possession of a credential with attributes that fulfill the resource's or service's access policy. We are interested in anonymous credential systems that support complex access policies.  
 In order for an anonymous credential system to be considered secure, the user must be able to access a resource without revealing his identity. Besides anonymity of users, credential systems must also make sure that users cannot collude and combine their attributes. A group of users must not be able to access to a resource for which none of the users (individually) have access to. Constructions of anonymous credentials usually rely on - among others - pairings and digital signatures.  
 The goal of this research area is to construct provably secure anonymous credential systems that support complex access policies.  

  Se­cure and Ef­fi­cient Im­ple­ment­a­tions  

 Because of the many applications of elliptic curves and pairings, increasingly more efficient algorithms to compute pairings have been developed in recent years. By now, pairings can even be computed in reasonably quickly on resource-restricted systems such as chip cards. This is particularly interesting if we want to defend against attackers with physical access to hardware executing computations that depend on a secret key. There are several ways to physically attack hardware which are usually not in the scope of formal security proofs. A physical attacker may try to gain information about the secret key by exploiting side channels. For example, the attacker may actively manipulate an algorithm's execution, or passively measure power consumption and running time.  
 Pairings are defined on subgroups of elliptic curves over finite fields. These structures are also the basis for elliptic curve cryptography. There are already many theoretical and practical results on side-channel reistant elliptic curve cryptography. In part, these can be applied to pairing-based cryptography. For example, fault injection attacks on elliptic curve cryptography can be applied to pairing-based cryptography. For passive attacks, analysis methods for extracting information from power consumption can be applied as well. However, what cannot be easily applied to pairing-based cryptography are answers to the question "what manipulations are useful for an attacker?" and "how do I derive a secret key from data gathered through side channels?". This is because of the higher algorithm complexity and the role of the secret key for computations.  
 The goal of this research area is to improve security of pairing-based cryptography implemenations, to identify relevant side channels and to design efficient countermeasures against physical attackers.

 Please Note  
 1. We expect at least one author of an accepted paper to attend the conference. The expectation of attendance is implicit in submitting a paper to a conference, rather than a journal, and brings ethical responsibilities to participate actively in the conference (talking to other attendees, presenting the paper, and attending conference sessions).  
  2. Consequently, it is expected that all accepted papers will be presented in person, unless clear and extenuating circumstances prevent attendance.  
  3. As an author of an accepted paper, this means you should exhaust all efforts to attend, including seeking a visa (where needed).  
  4. Any allowance for remote presentation will be considered only after clear evidence that attendance is impossible.  
  5. These decisions about remote presentation will be made two weeks before the conference begins.  
  6. The conference proceedings will be finalized after the conference based on the papers presented.  
  7. A registration fee is required for all accepted papers, regardless of attendance.

 About NSS 2023  
 While the attack systems have become more easy-to-use, sophisticated, and powerful, interest has greatly increased in the field of building more effective, intelligent, adaptive, active and high performance defense systems which are distributed and networked. The conference will cover research on all theoretical and practical aspects related to network and system security, such as authentication, access control, availability, integrity, privacy, confidentiality, dependability and sustainability of computer networks and systems.  
 Founded in 2007, the aim of the NSS (International Conference on Network and System Security) series  is to provide a leading edge forum to foster interaction between researchers and developers with the network and system security communities, and to give attendees an opportunity to interact with experts in academia, industry, and governments. NSS 2023 is the 17th edition of the International Conference on Network and System Security series, which started in 2007. Previous editions were held in: Fiji (2022)  ; Tianjin, China (2021)  ; Melbourne, Australia (2020)  ; Sapporo, Japan (2019)  ; Hong Kong, China (2018)  ; Helsinki, Finland (2017)  ; Taipei (2016)  ; New York City, USA (2015)  ; Xi'an, China (2014)  ; Madrid, Spain (2013)  ; Wu Yi Shan, China (2012)  ; Milan, Italy (2011)  ; Melbourne, Australia (2010)  ; Gold Coast, Australia (2009)  ; Shanghai, China (2008)  ; and Dalian, China (2007).  
 About SocialSec 2023  
 Social Networks and Big Data have pervaded all aspects of our daily lives. With their unparalleled popularity, social networks have evolved from the platforms for social communication and news dissemination, to indispensable tools for professional networking, social recommendations, marketing, and online content distribution. Social Networks, together with other activities, produce Big Data that is beyond the ability of commonly used computer software and hardware tools to capture, manage, and process within a tolerable elapsed time. It has been widely recognised that security and privacy are the critical challenges for Social Networks and Big Data applications due to their scale, complexity and heterogeneity.  
 SocialSec 2023 is the 9th edition of the International Symposium on Security and Privacy in Social Networks and Big Data series  , which started in 2015. Previous editions were held in Xi'an, China (2022)  ; Fuzhou, China (2021)  ; Tianjin, China (2020)  ; Copenhagen, Denmark (2019)  ; Santa Clara, CA, USA (2018)  ; Melbourne, Australia (2017)  ; Fiji (2016)  ; and Hangzhou, China (2015)  .

  Submission Guidelines  
 Paper submissions should not exceed 10 pages (including references)  and all submissions must be made electronically through the conference submission portal ( https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/icpp  ) in PDF format printable on US letter size (8.5" x 11") paper. Please use the ACM format located at: https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template  . More speciﬁcally, we recommend using \documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart} conﬁguration for submissions prepared in LaTex. Changes to the template (e.g., margin, font size) could lead to automatic rejection. Up to two additional pages may be subsequently purchased (if needed) for the camera-ready version. Submissions should represent original research results and cannot already be under review or accepted for publication in another venue.  
  
  The review process is double-anonymous  , so submissions should not  reveal the identity of the authors. Authors should leave out author names, aﬃliations, and (any) acknowledgment from the body of their submission. They should also ensure that any references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person  (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). The purpose of this process is to help the Program Committee and external reviewers come to a judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Authors with further questions about double-anonymous reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chairs by email.  
  
  The ICPP 2023 technical program includes a reproducibility initiative  , where the submitters will be given an option to submit details about the artifacts that enable their experiments to be reproduced. A reproducibility submission consists of the description of the computational artifacts (up to two pages appendix) and persistent and permanent links to the computational artifacts submission ( more information regarding the ICPP reproducibility initiative here  ). The submission of the reproducibility artifacts will be voluntary, but their presence will be an advantage during the decision process compared to submissions with equivalent ratings without artifacts. We also plan to have rebuttals  only for papers that do not have a clear accept or reject decision."  
  
  All accepted papers that are presented at the conference will be published in the ACM Digital Library. Accepted papers will also need to follow the conference registration policy to be included in the conference proceedings. We will oﬀer rejected papers an opportunity to be forwarded to workshop organizers to be considered in one of the workshops if the authors choose to do so.

Conference site: https://pact2023.github.io/submit/ ** Scope ** The International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques (PACT) is a unique technical conference sitting at the intersection of hardware and software, with a special emphasis on parallelism. The PACT conference series brings together researchers from computer architectures, compilers, execution environments, programming languages, and applications, to present and discuss their latest research results. PACT 2023 will be held as an in-person event in the beautiful city of Vienna. At least one of the authors of accepted papers will be required to attend the conference, and we encourage all the authors to participate. ** Specific topics of interest include (but are not limited to): ** Parallel architectures Compilers and tools for parallel computer systems Applications and experimental systems studies of parallel processing Computational models for concurrent execution Multicore, multithreaded, superscalar, and VLIW architectures Compiler and hardware support for hiding memory latencies Support for correctness in hardware and software Reconfigurable parallel computing Dynamic translation and optimization I/O issues in parallel computing and their relation to applications Parallel programming languages, algorithms, and applications Middleware and run time system support for parallel computing Application-specific parallel systems Distributed computing architectures and systems Heterogeneous systems using various types of accelerators In-core and in-chip accelerators and their exploitation Applications of machine learning to parallel computing Large scale data processing, including computing in memory accelerators Insights for the design of parallel architectures and compilers from modern parallel applications Neuromorphic computing both as an application for and a tool applied to architectures and compilers. ** Submitting your work ** Paper submissions are due April 1, 2023 by posting on the conference submission site. Please make sure that your paper satisfies all the following requirements before being submitted. Submissions not adhering to these submission guidelines will be rejected by the submission system and/or subject to an administrative rejection. The paper must have an abstract under 300 words. The paper must be original material that has not been previously published in another conference or journal, nor is currently under review by another conference or journal. You may submit material presented previously at a workshop without copyrighted proceedings. The submission is limited to ten (10) pages in the ACM 8.5” x 11” format (US letter size paper) using 9pt font, with no more than 7 lines per inch. This page limit applies to all content NOT INCLUDING references, and there is no page limit for references. Your paper must print satisfactorily on both Letter paper (8.5”x11”) and A4 paper (8.27”x11.69”). The box containing the text should be no larger than 7.15”x9” (18.2cm x 22.9cm). Templates are available on the ACM Author Gateway. Paper submission is double-blind to reduce reviewer bias against authors or institutions. Thus, the submissions cannot include author names, institutions or hints based on references to prior work. If authors are extending their own work, they need to reference and discuss the past work in third person, as if they were extending someone else’s research. We realize that for some papers it will still reveal authorship, but as long as an effort was made to follow these guidelines, the submission will not be penalized. Anonymized supplementary material may be provided in a single PDF file uploaded at paper submission time, containing material that supports the content of the paper, such as proofs, additional experimental results, data sets, etc. Reviewers are not required to read the supplementary material but may choose to do so. Please make sure that the labels on your graphs are readable without the aid of a magnifying glass. The paper must be submitted in PDF. We cannot accept any other format, and we must be able to print the document just as we receive it. We suggest that you use only the four widely used printer fonts: Times, Helvetica, Courier and Symbol. Poster submissions must conform to the same format restrictions, but may not exceed 2 pages in length. Paper submissions that are not accepted for regular presentations will automatically be considered for posters; authors who do not want their paper considered for the poster session should indicate this in their abstract submission. Two-page summaries of accepted posters will be included in the conference proceedings. Please submit your work via the conference submission site. ** Conflicts of interest ** Authors must identify any conflicts-of-interest with PC members and external members of the community. We ask all authors of a submitted paper to register their conflicts at the submission site. If a paper is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem OR if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or game the review system, the paper may be rejected. Conflicts of interests are defined according to ACM’s conflict of interest policy. Artifact evaluation Authors of accepted PACT 2023 papers are encouraged to formally submit their supporting materials for Artifact Evaluation. The Artifact Evaluation process is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess the availability, functionality, and reproducibility of the work and experimental results described in the paper. Submission is voluntary. We strongly encourage authors to consider submitting artifacts for their work, including simulators for new architectural designs and extensions. We encourage authors to prepare their artifacts for submission and make them more portable, reusable and customizable using open-source frameworks including Docker, OCCAM, reprozip, CodeOcean and CK. Papers that successfully go through the Artifact Evaluation process will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Authors of such papers will have an option to include their Artifact Appendix to the final paper (up to 2 pages). Authors are also encouraged to make their artifacts publicly available. ** Code of Conduct ** All individuals participating in PACT or involved with its organization are expected to follow the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct; The IEEE Code of Ethics and Code of Conduct; and the Policy Against Harassment at ACM activities. ** Publication policies ** PACT is supported by both ACM and IEEE and articles accepted for publication are available on both the ACM digital library and IEEE Xplore. By submitting your article to an PACT, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects, and the IEEE Publication Policies. Alleged violations of these policies will be investigated by officers of ACM or IEEE and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per their policies. Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.
