Similar to previous years, ACML 2023 has two publication tracks  . Authors may submit either to: 
Conference Track: | (16-page limit with references) for which the proceedings will be published as a volume of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research Workshop and Conference Proceedings (PMLR).
 Journal Track: | (20-page limit with references) for which accepted papers will appear in a special issue of the Springer Machine Learning Journal (MLJ).
 Please note that submission procedures for the two tracks are different. Please read the instructions carefully before submitting.   
Conference Track 
Submission Deadline: June 30, 2023  June 23, 2023   For the conference track, please submit your manuscript via CMT at: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACML2023  . 
IMPORTANT:   When creating a new submission on CMT, please ensure you choose the "Conference"  track. 
The Latex submission template and style file can be found here: ACML2023_submission_template.zip  . 
 The Latex camera-ready template and style file can be found here: ACML2023_camera-ready_template.zip  . 
Manuscripts must be written in English, be a maximum of 16 pages (including references, appendices, etc.) and follow the PMLR style. If required, supplementary material may be submitted as a separate file, but reviewers are not obliged to consider this. 
All conference track submissions must be anonymized  . Submissions that are not anonymized, over-length, or not in the correct format will be rejected without review. To anonymize, simply leave the author information empty in the Tex template. There is no separate format for anonymizing. 
It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g., in arXiv) as long as it is not cited in the submission. 
Journal Track 
Submission Deadline: June 02, 2023  May 26, 2023   In addition to the conference track, this year’s ACML will run a journal track, similar to previous years. Papers that are accepted to the journal track must be presented at the conference in order to be published. 
IMPORTANT:   Similar to previous years, for the journal track, the abstract and the paper must be submitted to two different systems simultaneously   for the purpose of review management: 
First, please submit ONLY the title and abstract via CMT at: | https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACML2023. | (paper manuscript need not be submitted here). When creating the submission on CMT, please choose the | "Journal" | track.
 Then, please submit the paper via Springer’s Editorial Manager system at: | https://www.editorialmanager.com/mach. | When creating a new submission on Springer’s Editorial Manager, please make sure to choose | "S.I.: ACML 2023" | as the article type.
 For the journal track, manuscripts must be written in English with a maximum of 20 pages (including references, appendices, etc.). For the template and style files, please follow the instructions for authors on the journal website: https://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10994  . 
The journal track will follow the reviewing process of the Machine Learning journal. This includes allowing papers that require minor changes to be resubmitted after a first-round review. The journal track committee will aim to complete the reviewing process in time for this year’s conference. In the unlikely event that the reviewing process for a paper is not completed in time (for this year’s conference), the paper will not be considered for the conference and the review will be completed as a regular submission to the Machine Learning journal. 
The journal track review is single-blind, i.e., the authors’ identity will be visible to reviewers. It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. Submissions that are not in the correct format will be rejected without review. In addition, extended versions of published conference papers are not eligible for journal track submission. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g., in arXiv).
14. ACML_3 conference:

Some of our participants are unfortunately facing visa challenges  that might prevent them from joining us in person at the conference. We understand the immense effort and dedication it takes to contribute to ACM Multimedia 2023, and we want to reassure everyone that even if you cannot attend in person due to unforeseen circumstances, your paper will still be featured in the conference proceedings. Our team is dedicated to ensuring a fulfilling and enriching experience for all participants, whether they attend in person or online. We will do our utmost to accommodate any challenges and ensure a satisfactory conference experience for all. 
In addition, we’d like to inform you that your paper will be presented in a 2-minute teaser session for those attending in person. For those who may not be able to make it in person, we will also have 2-minute teaser sessions in separate offline sessions to ensure your research receives the attention it deserves.  
We hope to see as many of you as possible, and we thank you for your understanding.

Make sure to book your hotel stay at the Westin Hotel,  Ottawa conference hotel. The hotel  is at the center of the conference activity, and will allow you to network easily with other conference attendees. Also, it’s a quick trip to get to the program and functions, and just as quick to nip back to your room for a break. Staying at the conference hotel will provide a better conference experience! 
Everyone enjoys meeting in a comfortable conference venue, offering quality service and support for workshops, tutorials, plenary sessions, and other activities. As the transaction for those services and support, the conference guarantees that a percentage of attendees will stay in the hotel. The contract with the hotel then guarantees a specific number of sleeping rooms will be used each night during the conference. If the conference does not meet the contracted sleeping room commitment, the hotel gets paid anyway. Those unfilled rooms will cost the conference thousands of dollars. 
Please support ACMMM 2023 and SIGMM by staying at the Westin Hotel!

AAAI-23 Main Technical Track 
Call for Papers 
 All authors must complete a reproducibility checklist, which facilitates replication of the reported research.
 All authors are expected to be available to review (light load), unless extenuating circumstances apply.
 NeurIPS-22 Fast Track: rejected papers with *final, average* scores of at least 4.9 may be submitted directly into AAAI-23’s Phase 2 along with, for example, previous reviews and paper ID.
 The purpose of the AAAI conference series is to promote research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and foster scientific exchange between researchers, practitioners, scientists, students, and engineers across the entirety of AI and its affiliated disciplines. AAAI-23 is the Thirty-Seventh AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. The theme of this conference is to create collaborative bridges  within and beyond AI. Like previous AAAI conferences, AAAI-23 will feature technical paper presentations, special tracks, invited speakers, workshops, tutorials, poster sessions, senior member presentations, competitions, and exhibit programs, and two new activities: a Bridge Program and a Lab Program. Many of these activities are tailored to the theme of bridges and all are selected according to the highest standards, with additional programs for students and young researchers. 
Driven by its disciplinary diversity, AAAI has incubated numerous AI sub-disciplines and conferences and has nurtured for decades the cohesion of AI. New communities often emerge when two or more disciplines come together in order to explore new opportunities and perspectives; today both are plentiful. The purpose of this year’s Bridge Program is to tap into new sources of innovation by cultivating sustained collaboration between two or more communities, directed towards a common goal. Our interpretation of bridge  is broad and encompasses disciplines both within and outside of AI. Hence, the communities that our Bridge Program is intended to bring together could be distinct subfields of AI, such as planning and learning, or different disciplines that contribute to and benefit from AI, such as AI and the humanities. 
We plan for AAAI-23 to be an in-person conference and are exploring opportunities to complement this with remote participation. Given the volatile situation, however, the exact format of the conference can only be decided at a later stage.

ADCOM 2023: Adaptive, Generative and Bio-inspired AI in Computing and Communication  
The Advanced Computing and Communications Society  (ACCS) in association with the Digital University Kerala  announces the 28th annual International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications  (ADCOM 2023) at Maker Village, Kochi during 8th – 10th December 2023. 
ADCOM, the flagship Systems Conference of the ACCS, is a major annual international meeting that draws leading scientists and researchers in computational and communications engineering from across industry and academia. ADCOM highlights the growing importance of Large-Scale Systems Engineering and provides the platform to share, discuss and witness leading edge research and trends. 
ADCOM 2023 explores the current state-of-art AI covering a broad spectrum of adaptive, generative and bio-inspired algorithms and/or hardware useful in computing and communications. Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can create new content, such as text, images, or other media, from scratch. Generative AI models are trained on large datasets of existing content, and then use this data to learn the patterns and rules that govern how that content is created. Generative AI has a wide range of potential applications in Content creation, Data augmentation, Artificial intelligence assistant, Entertainment, Product design etc.

Call for papers  
The ACM MobiCom conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions in the field of wireless networking and mobile computing. MobiCom solicits papers that address important research challenges and build practical working systems. Successful papers should propose novel ideas to attack such problems through rigorous analysis, system design and real-world measurement or deployment of mobile networks, systems and applications. 
 
 MobiCom’23 will emphasize novelty and creativity while, at the same time, taking a broader and more inclusive view of wireless and mobile systems research. On one hand, the more novel the concept, the harder it can be to fully develop or evaluate all its aspects. On the other hand the more practical and developed the system, the more simple and sometimes known techniques must be leveraged. The review process will take both cases into account as intellectual merit and novelty can be found in techniques, system designs, implementations, and applications. The review process will also favor papers that describe how the authors will provide access to well-documented datasets, modeling and/or simulation tools, and codebases to support the reproducibility of their methods as well as papers that highlight and discuss not only the significance but also the limitations of the work. 
 
 Unlike in previous years, MobiCom’23 will not have separate categories of challenge, experience, and verification papers. However, we do encourage the submission of experience papers as full papers that provide detailed technical insight into real-world deployments of novel technologies and systems. MobiCom'23 will also incorporate early notifications for papers rejected in round 1 and rebuttals as described below in more detail.

 Two Deadlines, Early Notification, Rebuttals, and One-shot Revision 

 MobiCom 2023 offers authors the option of two deadlines and keeps the one-shot revision process to enhance the timeliness and quality of the scientific results from the research community. Each paper will go through the same rigorous reviewing process as in previous MobiCom conferences. The review process for each deadline will involve two rounds. Papers that are not selected to proceed after the first round will receive an early notification, including reviews. After the second round of reviews, the reviews will be released to the authors and who will have one week to submit a rebuttal. 
 
 Rebuttals 
MobiCom will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to the final consideration of the papers at the program committee meeting. Authors must limit their responses to (a) correcting factual errors in the reviews or (b) directly addressing questions posed by reviewers. Responses should be limited to clarifying the submitted work. In particular, responses must not include new experiments, new data, or new figures, describe additional work completed since submission or promise additional work to follow. 
 
 The submission of a rebuttal is optional. Rebuttals will be limited to a maximum of 1000 words submitted in the online submission form. It is worth noting that available reviews will be released at the above-mentioned times. However, additional reviews might be solicited or submitted after the rebuttal period. 
 
 Final decisions will be one of the following 

 Accept | : Accepted papers will be presented at the MobiCom conference and appear as part of the proceedings and the MobiCom website. Note all the papers in this category will initially be | conditionally accepted | . The papers that go through a successful | anonymous | shepherding process will eventually be accepted.
 Reject | : Rejected after reviewed papers cannot be resubmitted until 11 months have passed since the last MobiCom deadline they were submitted to. We strongly encourage the authors to address reviewers' feedback before re-submitting the paper to MobiCom.
 One-Shot-Revision | : Papers, where a revision is required, will be given specific action points and can be resubmitted for the | next | deadline. For such papers, the reviewers will articulate a maximum of three major changes/clarifications that they would like to see. After the resubmission, the paper will be evaluated based on whether the authors have properly addressed the reviewers’ requests. Unlike in the shepherding process, the requested action points may include running additional experiments that obtain specific results and could take more than 4-6 weeks. During this revision period, the paper is still considered under review to MobiCom and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration.
 
 Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers 
The authors of accepted MobiCom 2023 papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee that will assess how well the submitted artifacts support the work described in the accepted papers. Participation in Artifact Evaluation is voluntary and has no influence on the paper’s acceptance, but is strongly encouraged. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive badges printed on the papers themselves. Additional details on the Artifact Evaluation process can be found here. 
 
 Submission Instructions 

 All paper submissions will be handled electronically at the MobiCom ’23 paper submission website  . Authors should prepare a PDF version of their full paper. All submitted papers will be evaluated through a double-blind  reviewing process, with the identities of the authors withheld from the reviewers. 
 
 Before final submission, you are expected to make sure that your paper complies with the following requirements. Please do not violate these requirements with the aim of including additional material: ​submissions that violate the formatting requirements may not be reviewed​.  You can visually inspect a page-by-page report of your paper format using the same tool as the submission system via a separate ​ online form  . After the submission deadline, we will use the same tool to check the conformance of papers. The format checking tool uses heuristics and can make mistakes. The PC chairs will manually inspect and possibly reject those papers with evident format violations. However, no paper will be rejected due to format violations without being manually checked. 
 
 Any papers that do not adhere to the following guidelines may be immediately rejected:

 June 17–21, 2023  
 ISCA Industry Track: Call for Papers  

 The 50th International Symposium of Computer Architecture includes a separate industry session in the main program following the success of the industry track inaugurated in ISCA 2020  . The ISCA Industry Track was established under a different vision and motive to bringing the values, trends, and perspectives of real hardware product and system design from the industries. It also serves as a venue to encourage more participation from industries to interact with academia for forward-looking research challenges and solutions. In light of the very specific purpose of the industry track, the submission guidelines are also very specific.  
   
 At a Glance  
   
 First author, and most authors, | must be from industry 
  Not for student internship projects 
  Submissions | must include all author names and affiliations | for review (authors may remain blinded) 
  All ISCA | formatting guidelines | apply ( | 11 pages without references, 10pt font | ) 
  Abstract Deadline: | January 6, 2023 at 11:59 PM EST 
  Full Paper Deadline: | January 13, 2023 at 11:59 PM EST 
  Rebuttal/Revision period: | February 23 - 27, 2023 
   Upload Abstracts and Papers to Industry Track HotCRP   

  Submission Guidelines  
 The papers ideally include (1) retrospective evaluations of real working products, (2) upcoming industry products on their roadmaps, and/or (3) planned products that were canceled but present interesting insights or lessons learned. 
  The following types of submissions will | not | be considered: (1) students' short-term internship projects in industries, or (2) speculation about hardware that might be built. 
  The first and most of the authors | of such papers must work in industry. 
  The submissions are required to disclose the affiliations of all authors. | Reviewers want to know which product is being evaluated and which company is writing the paper. Review assignments will still follow common practice to avoid conflicts of interest. 
  All | formatting guidelines | for the general submission (including page limits) must also be followed by any paper submitted to the industry track. The accepted paper will be labelled as an "Industry Product" in the conference proceedings. 
  Submissions that fail to abide by the guidelines will be rejected without review.  

  Important Dates  
 The program committee recognizes that industry papers need to be approved by management (often involving multiple rounds of redaction) before they can be submitted, and there can be restrictions about filing patents before submitting a paper. Therefore, a later deadline schedule is adopted to increase the chances of receiving such papers.  
 Abstract Deadline: | January 6, 2023 at 11:59 PM EST 
  Full Paper Deadline: | January 13, 2023 at 11:59 PM EST 

  Topics of Interest  
 Paper topics are not limited to hardware tapeouts. In particular, papers that are software-centric papers relevant to the ISCA audience are welcome in this track (e.g. datacenter software work, compiler work accelerator software stack work), but they should adhere to the tenet that they must be industry papers about production-level work - whether retrospective, planned and on the roadmap, or planned but canceled.  
 Processors, SoCs, GPUs, and domain-specific accelerators 
  Systems and interconnect technologies for HPC, cloud, or data centers 
  Embedded, mobile, and IoT processors 
  FPGA or reconfigurable architectures 
  Storage and emerging memory systems 
  Architectures using emerging technology

 Abstract  
 Cognitive tools for uncovering useful abstractions  
 In the 17th century, the Cartesian coordinate system was groundbreaking. It exposed the unity between algebra and geometry, accelerating the development of the math that took humans to the moon. It was not just another concept, but a cognitive tool that people could wield to express abstract ideas in visual form, thereby expanding their capacity to think and generate new insights about a variety of other problems. Research in my lab aims to uncover the psychological mechanisms that explain how people have come to deploy these technologies in such innovative ways to learn, share knowledge, and create new things. In the first part of this talk, I will provide an overview of our recent work investigating drawing — one of our most enduring and versatile tools. Across several empirical and computational studies, I’ll argue that drawing not only provides a window into how we perceive and understand the visual world, but also accelerates humans’ ability to learn and communicate useful abstractions. In the second part, I will describe an emerging line of work investigating how humans discover new abstractions when building physical structures, and externalize these abstractions to support planning and collaboration. I will close by noting the broader implications of embracing such complex, naturalistic behaviors for advancing theories of human cognition and enhancing real-world impact, including in AI and education.

 Almost Chor-Goldreich Sources and Adversarial Random Walks   
 Dean Doron 
  Dana Moshkovitz 
  Justin Oh 
  David Zuckerman 
  A Chor–Goldreich (CG) source is a sequence of random variables X  = X  1  ∘ … ∘ X  t   , where each X  i   ∼ {0,1} d   and X  i   has δ d  min-entropy conditioned on any fixing of X  1  ∘ … ∘ X  i  −1  . The parameter 0<δ≤ 1 is the entropy rate of the source. We typically think of d  as constant and t  as growing. We extend this notion in several ways, defining almost CG sources. Most notably, we allow each X  i   to only have conditional Shannon entropy δ d  .  
 We achieve pseudorandomness results for almost CG sources which were not known to hold even for standard CG sources, and even for the weaker model of Santha–Vazirani sources: We construct a deterministic condenser that on input X  , outputs a distribution which is close to having constant entropy gap, namely a distribution Z  ∼ {0,1} m   for m  ≈ δ dt  with min-entropy m  − O  (1). Therefore, we can simulate any randomized algorithm with small failure probability using almost CG sources with no multiplicative slowdown. This result extends to randomized protocols as well, and any setting in which we cannot simply cycle over all seeds, and a “one-shot” simulation is needed. Moreover, our construction works in an online manner, since it is based on random walks on expanders.  
 Our main technical contribution is a novel analysis of random walks, which should be of independent interest. We analyze walks with adversarially correlated steps, each step being entropy-deficient, on good enough lossless expanders. We prove that such walks (or certain interleaved walks on two expanders), starting from a fixed vertex and walking according to X  1  ∘ … ∘ X  t   , accumulate most of the entropy in X  .  

 A New Berry-Esseen Theorem for Expander Walks   
 Louis Golowich 
  We prove that the sum of t  boolean-valued random variables sampled by a random walk on a regular expander converges in total variation distance to a discrete normal distribution at a rate of O  (λ/ t  1/2− o  (1)  ), where λ is the second largest eigenvalue of the random walk matrix in absolute value. To the best of our knowledge, among known Berry-Esseen bounds for Markov chains, our result is the first to show convergence in total variation distance, and is also the first to incorporate a linear dependence on expansion λ. In contrast, prior Markov chain Berry-Esseen bounds showed a convergence rate of O  (1/√ t  ) in weaker metrics such as Kolmogorov distance.  
 Our result also improves upon prior work in the pseudorandomness literature, which showed that the total variation distance is O  (λ) when the approximating distribution is taken to be a binomial distribution. We achieve the faster O  (λ/ t  1/2− o  (1)  ) convergence rate by generalizing the binomial distribution to discrete normals of arbitrary variance. We specifically construct discrete normals using a random walk on an appropriate 2-state Markov chain. Our bound can therefore be viewed as a regularity lemma that reduces the study of arbitrary expanders to a small class of particularly simple expanders.  

 Near-Optimal Derandomization of Medium-Width Branching Programs   
 Aaron (Louie) Putterman 
  Edward Pyne 
  We give a deterministic white-box algorithm to estimate the expectation of a read-once branching program of length n  and width w  in space Õ(log n  +√log n  ·log w  ). In particular, we obtain an almost optimal space Õ(log n  ) derandomization of programs up to width w  =2 √log n   . Previously, the best known space complexity for this problem was O  (min{log n  · log w  ,log 3/2  n  +√log n  · log w  }) via the classic algorithms of Savitch (JCSS 1970) and Saks and Zhou (JCSS 1999), which only achieve space Õ(log n  ) for w  = poly  log( n  ). We prove this result by showing that a variant of the Saks-Zhou algorithm developed by Cohen, Doron, and Sberlo (ECCC 2022) still works without executing one of the steps in the algorithm, the so-called random shift step. This allows us to extend their algorithm from computing the n  th power of a w  × w  stochastic matrix to multiplying n  distinct w  × w  stochastic matrices with no degradation in space consumption. In the regime where w  ≥ n  , we also show that our approach can achieve parameters matching those of the original Saks-Zhou algorithm (with no loglog factors). Finally, we show that for w  ≤ 2 √log n   , an algorithm even simpler than our algorithm and that of Saks and Zhou achieves space O  (log 3/2  n  ).  

 Approximating Iterated Multiplication of Stochastic Matrices in Small Space   
 Gil Cohen 
  Dean Doron 
  Ori Sberlo 
  Amnon Ta-Shma 
  Matrix powering, and more generally iterated matrix multiplication, is a fundamental linear algebraic primitive with myriad applications in computer science. Of particular interest is the problem’s space complexity as it constitutes the main route towards resolving the BPL vs. L problem. The seminal work by Saks and Zhou [JCSS ’99] gives a deterministic algorithm for approximating the product of n  stochastic matrices of dimension w  × w  in space O  (log 3/2  n  + √log n  · log w  ). The first improvement upon Saks–Zhou was achieved by Hoza [RANDOM ’21] who gave a logarithmic improvement in the n=poly(w) regime, attaining O  (1/√loglog n  · log 3/2  n  ) space.  
 We give the first polynomial improvement over Saks and Zhou’s algorithm. Our algorithm achieves space complexity of O  (log n  + √log n  · log w  ). In particular, in the regime log n  > log 2  w  , our algorithm runs in nearly-optimal O  (log n  ) space, improving upon the previous best O  (log 3/2  n  ).  
 To obtain our result for the special case of matrix powering, we harness recent machinery from time- and space-bounded Laplacian solvers to the Saks–Zhou framework and devise an intricate precision-alternating recursive scheme. This enables us to bypass the bottleneck of paying log n  -space per recursion level. The general case of iterated matrix multiplication poses several additional challenges, the substantial of which is handled by devising an improved shift and truncate mechanism. The new mechanism is made possible by a novel use of the Richardson iteration.  

 Extractors for Images of Varieties   
 Zeyu Guo 
  Ben Lee Volk 
  Akhil Jalan 
  David Zuckerman 
  We construct explicit deterministic extractors for polynomial images of varieties, that is, distributions sampled by applying a low-degree polynomial map f  : F q   r   → F q   n   to an element sampled uniformly at random from a k  -dimensional variety V  ⊆ F q   r   . This class of sources generalizes both polynomial sources, studied by Dvir, Gabizon and Wigderson (FOCS 2007, Comput. Complex. 2009), and variety sources, studied by Dvir (CCC 2009, Comput. Complex. 2012).  
 Assuming certain natural non-degeneracy conditions on the map f  and the variety V  , which in particular ensure that the source has enough min-entropy, we extract almost all the min-entropy of the distribution. Unlike the Dvir–Gabizon–Wigderson and Dvir results, our construction works over large enough finite fields of arbitrary characteristic. One key part of our construction is an improved deterministic rank extractor for varieties. As a by-product, we obtain explicit Noether normalization lemmas for affine varieties and affine algebras.  
 Additionally, we generalize a construction of affine extractors with exponentially small error due to Bourgain, Dvir and Leeman (Comput. Complex. 2016) by extending it to all finite prime fields of quasipolynomial size.  

 When Arthur Has Neither Random Coins Nor Time to Spare: Superfast Derandomization of Proof Systems   
 Lijie Chen 
  Roei Tell 
  What is the actual cost of derandomization? And can we get it for free? These questions were recently raised by Doron et. al (FOCS 2020) and have been attracting considerable interest. In this work we extend the study of these questions to the setting of derandomizing interactive proofs systems.  
 First, we show conditional derandomization of MA  and of AM  with optimal runtime overhead, where optimality is under the # NSETH  assumption. Specifically, denote by AM  TIME  [⇌ c  ]  [ T  ] a protocol with c  turns of interaction in which the verifier runs in polynomial time T  . We prove that, for every constant є>0,  
 MATIME  [ T  ] ⊆ NTIME  [ T  2+є  ] ,  
 AM  TIME  [⇌ c  ]  [ T  ] ⊆ NTIME  [ n  · T  ⌈ c  /2 ⌉ + є  ] ;  
 assuming the existence of properties of Boolean functions that can be recognized quickly from the function’s truth-table such that functions with the property are hard for proof systems that receive near-maximal amount of non-uniform advice.  
 To obtain faster derandomization, we introduce the notion of a deterministic effective argument system. This is an NP  -type proof system in which the verifier is deterministic, and the soundness is relaxed to be computational, as follows: For every probabilistic polynomial-time adversary P, the probability that P finds an input x  ∉ L  and misleading proof π such that V  ( x  ,π)=1 is negligible.  
 Under strong hardness assumptions, we prove that any constant-round doubly efficient proof system can be compiled into a deterministic effective argument system, with essentially no time overhead. As one corollary, under strong hardness assumptions, for every є>0 there is a deterministic verifier V  that gets an n  -bit formula Φ of size 2 o  ( n  )  , runs in time 2 є · n   , and satisfies the following: An honest prover running in time 2 O  ( n  )  can print, for every Φ, a proof π such that V  (Φ,π) outputs the number of satisfying assignments for Φ; and for every adversary P running in time 2 O  ( n  )  , the probability that P finds Φ and π such that V  (Φ,π) outputs an incorrect count is 2 −ω( n  )  .  

 Hardness Self-Amplification: Simplified, Optimized, and Unified   
 Shuichi Hirahara 
  Nobutaka Shimizu 
  Strong (resp. weak) average-case hardness refers to the properties of a computational problem in which a large (resp. small) fraction of instances are hard to solve. We develop a general framework for proving hardness self-amplification, that is, the equivalence between strong and weak average-case hardness. Using this framework, we prove hardness self-amplification for popular problems, such as matrix multiplication, online matrix-vector multiplication, triangle counting of Erdős–Rényi random graphs, and the planted clique problem. As a corollary, we obtain the first search-to-decision reduction for the planted clique problem in a high-error regime. Our framework simplifies, improves, and unifies the previous hardness self-amplification results.  
 Our approach uses a one-query upward self-reduction, that is, a reduction that maps a small instance to a large instance. We demonstrate that this reduction yields hardness self-amplification if the bipartite graph, whose left and right vertices correspond to small and large instances, respectively, has an expansion property. Our key technical contribution is to show the expansion property of the bipartite graph naturally constructed from the planted clique problem by using the coupling method of Markov chains.  

 Sum-of-Squares Lower Bounds for Densest k-Subgraph   
 Chris Jones 
  Aaron Potechin 
  Goutham Rajendran 
  Jeff Xu 
  Given a graph and an integer k  , Densest k  -Subgraph is the algorithmic task of finding the subgraph on k  vertices with the maximum number of edges. This is a fundamental problem that has been subject to intense study for decades, with applications spanning a wide variety of fields. The state-of-the-art algorithm is an O  ( n  1/4 +  )-factor approximation (for any > 0) due to Bhaskara et al. [STOC ’10]. Moreover, the so-called log-density framework  predicts that this is optimal, i.e. it is impossible for an efficient algorithm to achieve an O  ( n  1/4 −  )-factor approximation. In the average case, Densest k  -Subgraph is a prototypical noisy inference task which is conjectured to exhibit a statistical-computational gap  .  
 In this work, we provide the strongest evidence yet of hardness for Densest k  -Subgraph by showing matching lower bounds against the powerful Sum-of-Squares (SoS) algorithm, a meta-algorithm based on convex programming that achieves state-of-art algorithmic guarantees for many optimization and inference problems. For k  ≤ n  1/2  , we obtain a degree n  δ  SoS lower bound for the hard regime as predicted by the log-density framework.  
 To show this, we utilize the modern framework for proving SoS lower bounds on average-case problems pioneered by Barak et al. [FOCS ’16]. A key issue is that small denser-than-average subgraphs in the input will greatly affect the value of the candidate pseudoexpectation operator around the subgraph. To handle this challenge, we devise a novel matrix factorization scheme based on the positive minimum vertex separator  . We then prove an intersection tradeoff lemma to show that the error terms when using this separator are indeed small.  

 Exact Phase Transitions for Stochastic Block Models and Reconstruction on Trees   
 Elchanan Mossel 
  Allan Sly 
  Youngtak Sohn 
  In this paper, we rigorously establish the predictions in ground breaking work in statistical physics by Decelle, Krzakala, Moore, Zdeborová (2011) regarding the block model, in particular in the case of q  =3 and q  =4 communities.  
 We prove that for q  =3 and q  =4 there is no computational-statistical gap if the average degree is above some constant by showing that it is information theoretically impossible to detect below the Kesten-Stigum bound. We proceed by showing that for the broadcast process on Galton-Watson trees, reconstruction is impossible for q  =3 and q  =4 if the average degree is sufficiently large. This improves on the result of Sly (2009), who proved similar results for d  -regular trees when q  =3. Our analysis of the critical case q  =4 provides a detailed picture showing that the tightness of the Kesten-Stigum bound in the antiferromagnetic regime depends on the average degree of the tree. We also prove that for q  ≥ 5, the Kesten-Stigum bound is not sharp.  
 Our results prove conjectures of Decelle, Krzakala, Moore, Zdeborová (2011), Moore (2017), Abbe and Sandon (2018) and Ricci-Tersenghi, Semerjian, and Zdeborová (2019). Our proofs are based on a new general coupling of the tree and graph processes and on a refined analysis of the broadcast process on the tree.  

 Parallel Discrete Sampling via Continuous Walks

  Tianyu Liu

  Brian Xu 
  Katherine Yu 
  We develop a framework for sampling from discrete distributions µ on the hypercube {± 1} n   by sampling from continuous distributions supported on ℝ n   obtained by convolution with spherical Gaussians. We show that for well-studied families of discrete distributions µ, the result of the convolution is well-conditioned log-concave, whenever the Gaussian’s variance is above an O  (1) threshold. We plug off-the-shelf continuous sampling methods into our framework to obtain novel discrete sampling algorithms. Additionally, we introduce and study a crucial notion of smoothness for discrete distributions that we call transport stability, which we use to control the propagation of error in our framework. We expect transport stability to be of independent interest, as we connect it to constructions of optimally mixing local random walks and concentration inequalities. As our main application, we resolve open questions raised by Anari, Hu, Saberi, and Schild on the parallel sampling of distributions which admit parallel counting. We show that determinantal point processes can be sampled via RNC algorithms, that is in time log( n  ) O  (1)  using n  O  (1)  processors. For a wider class of distributions, we show our framework yields Quasi-RNC sampling, i.e., log( n  ) O  (1)  time using n  O  (log n  )  processors. This wider class includes non-symmetric determinantal point processes and random Eulerian tours in digraphs, the latter nearly resolving another open question raised by prior work.  

 Sampling from Convex Sets with a Cold Start using Multiscale Decompositions   
 Hariharan Narayanan 
  Amit Rajaraman 
  Piyush Srivastava 
  Running a random walk in a convex body K  ⊆ℝ n   is a standard approach to sample approximately uniformly from the body. The requirement is that from a suitable initial distribution, the distribution of the walk comes close to the uniform distribution π K   on K  after a number of steps polynomial in n  and the aspect ratio R  / r  (i.e., when rB  2  ⊆ K  ⊆ RB  2  ). Proofs of rapid mixing of such walks often require the probability density η 0  of the initial distribution with respect to π K   to be at most poly  ( n  ): this is called a “warm start”. Achieving a warm start often requires non-trivial pre-processing before starting the random walk. This motivates proving rapid mixing from a “cold start”, wherein η 0  can be as high as exp( poly  ( n  )). Unlike warm starts, a cold start is usually trivial to achieve. However, a random walk need not mix rapidly from a cold start: an example being the well-known “ball walk”. On the other hand, Lovász and Vempala proved that the “hit-and-run” random walk mixes rapidly from a cold start. For the related coordinate hit-and-run (CHR) walk, which has been found to be promising in computational experiments, rapid mixing from a warm start was proved only recently but the question of rapid mixing from a cold start remained open.  
 We construct a family of random walks inspired by classical decompositions of subsets of ℝ n   into countably many axis-aligned dyadic cubes. We show that even with a cold start, the mixing times of these walks are bounded by a polynomial in n  and the aspect ratio. Our main technical ingredient is an isoperimetric inequality for K  for a metric that magnifies distances between points close to the boundary of K  . As a corollary, we show that the CHR walk also mixes rapidly from a cold start.  

 SESSION: Session 1B  
 On Regularity Lemma and Barriers in Streaming and Dynamic Matching   
 Sepehr Assadi 
  Soheil Behnezhad 
  Sanjeev Khanna 
  Huan Li 
  We present a new approach for finding matchings in dense graphs by building on Szemerédi’s celebrated Regularity Lemma. This allows us to obtain non-trivial albeit slight improvements over longstanding bounds for matchings in streaming and dynamic graphs. In particular, we establish the following results for n  -vertex graphs:  
 A deterministic single-pass streaming algorithm that finds a (1− o  (1))-approximate matching in o  ( n  2  ) bits of space. This constitutes the first single-pass algorithm for this problem in sublinear space that improves over the 1/2-approximation of the greedy algorithm.  
 A randomized fully dynamic algorithm that with high probability maintains a (1− o  (1))-approximate matching in o  ( n  ) worst-case update time per each edge insertion or deletion. The algorithm works even against an adaptive adversary. This is the first o  ( n  ) update-time dynamic algorithm with approximation guarantee arbitrarily close to one.  
 Given the use of regularity lemma, the improvement obtained by our algorithms over trivial bounds is only by some (log *  n  ) Θ(1)  factor. Nevertheless, in each case, they show that the “right” answer to the problem is not what is dictated by the previous bounds.  
 Finally, in the streaming model, we also present a randomized (1− o  (1))-approximation algorithm whose space can be upper bounded by the density of certain Ruzsa-Szemerédi (RS) graphs. While RS graphs by now have been used extensively to prove streaming lower bounds, ours is the first to use them as an upper bound tool for desigining improved streaming algorithms.  

 Optimal Eigenvalue Approximation via Sketching   
 William Swartworth 
  David P. Woodruff 
  Given a symmetric matrix A  , we show from the simple sketch GAG  T   , where G  is a Gaussian matrix with k  = O  (1/є 2  ) rows, that there is a procedure for approximating all eigenvalues of A  simultaneously to within є || A  || F   additive error with large probability. Unlike the work of (Andoni, Nguyen, SODA, 2013), we do not require that A  is positive semidefinite and therefore we can recover sign information about the spectrum as well. Our result also significantly improves upon the sketching dimension of recent work for this problem (Needell, Swartworth, Woodruff FOCS 2022), and in fact gives optimal sketching dimension. Our proof develops new properties of singular values of GA  for a k  × n  Gaussian matrix G  and an n  × n  matrix A  which may be of independent interest. Additionally we achieve tight bounds in terms of matrix-vector queries. Our sketch can be computed using O  (1/є 2  ) matrix-vector multiplies, and by improving on lower bounds for the so-called rank estimation problem, we show that this number is optimal even for adaptive matrix-vector queries.  

 Streaming Euclidean MST to a Constant Factor   
 Xi Chen 
  Vincent Cohen-Addad 
  Rajesh Jayaram 
  Amit Levi 
  Erik Waingarten 
  We study streaming algorithms for the fundamental geometric problem of computing the cost of the Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) on an n  -point set X  ⊂ ℝ d   . In the streaming model, the points in X  can be added and removed arbitrarily, and the goal is to maintain an approximation in small space. In low dimensions, (1+є) approximations are possible in sublinear space [Frahling, Indyk, Sohler, SoCG ’05]. However, for high dimensional spaces the best known approximation for this problem was Õ(log n  ), due to [Chen, Jayaram, Levi, Waingarten, STOC ’22], improving on the prior O  (log 2  n  ) bound due to [Indyk, STOC ’04] and [Andoni, Indyk, Krauthgamer, SODA ’08]. In this paper, we break the logarithmic barrier, and give the first constant factor sublinear space approximation to Euclidean MST. For any є≥ 1, our algorithm achieves an Õ(є −2  ) approximation in n  O  (є)  space.  
 We complement this by proving that any single pass algorithm which obtains a better than 1.10-approximation must use Ω(√ n  ) space, demonstrating that (1+є) approximations are not possible in high-dimensions, and that our algorithm is tight up to a constant. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that (1+є) approximations are possible in sublinear space with O  (1/є) passes over the stream. More generally, for any α ≥ 2, we give a α-pass streaming algorithm which achieves a (1+ O  (logα + 1/ α є)) approximation in n  O  (є)  d  O  (1)  space.  
 All our streaming algorithms are linear sketches, and therefore extend to the massively-parallel computation model (MPC). Thus, our results imply the first (1+є)-approximation to Euclidean MST in a constant number of rounds in the MPC model. Previously, such a result was only known for low-dimensional space [Andoni, Nikolov, Onak, Yaroslavtsev, STOC ’15], or required either O  (log n  ) rounds or a O  (log n  ) approximation.  

 Streaming Euclidean Max-Cut: Dimension vs Data Reduction   
 Xiaoyu Chen 
  Shaofeng H.-C. Jiang 
  Robert Krauthgamer 
  Max-Cut is a fundamental problem that has been studied extensively in various settings. We design an algorithm for Euclidean Max-Cut, where the input is a set of points in ℝ d   , in the model of dynamic geometric streams, where the input X  ⊆ [Δ] d   is presented as a sequence of point insertions and deletions. Previously, Frahling and Sohler [STOC 2005] designed a (1+є)-approximation algorithm for the low-dimensional regime, i.e., it uses space exp( d  ).  
 To tackle this problem in the high-dimensional regime, which is of growing interest, one must improve the dependence on the dimension d  , ideally to space complexity poly  (є −1  d  logΔ). Lammersen, Sidiropoulos, and Sohler [WADS 2009] proved that Euclidean Max-Cut admits dimension reduction with target dimension d  ′ = poly  (є −1  ). Combining this with the aforementioned algorithm that uses space exp( d  ′), they obtain an algorithm whose overall space complexity is indeed polynomial in d  , but unfortunately exponential in є −1  .  
 We devise an alternative approach of data reduction  , based on importance sampling, and achieve space bound poly  (є −1  d  logΔ), which is exponentially better (in є) than the dimension-reduction approach. To implement this scheme in the streaming model, we employ a randomly-shifted quadtree to construct a tree embedding. While this is a well-known method, a key feature of our algorithm is that the embedding’s distortion O  ( d  logΔ) affects only the space complexity, and the approximation ratio remains 1+є.  

 (Noisy) Gap Cycle Counting Strikes Back: Random Order Streaming Lower Bounds for Connected Components and Beyond   
 Sepehr Assadi 
  Janani Sundaresan 
  We continue the study of the communication complexity of gap cycle counting problems. These problems have been introduced by Verbin and Yu [SODA 2011] and have found numerous applications in proving streaming lower bounds. In the noisy gap cycle counting problem (NGC), there is a small integer k  ≥ 1 and an n  -vertex graph consisted of vertex-disjoint union of either k  -cycles or 2 k  -cycles, plus O  ( n  / k  ) disjoint paths of length k  −1 in both cases (“noise”). The edges of this graph are partitioned between Alice and Bob whose goal is to decide which case the graph belongs to with minimal communication from Alice to Bob.  
  
 We study the robust communication complexity of NGC—à la Chakrabarti, Cormode, and McGregor [STOC 2008]—namely, when edges are partitioned randomly between the players. This is in contrast to all prior work on gap cycle counting problems in adversarial partitions. While NGC can be solved trivially with zero communication when k  < log n  , we prove that when k  is a constant factor larger than log n  , the robust (one-way) communication complexity of NGC is Ω( n  ) bits.  
  
 As a corollary of this result, we can prove several new graph streaming lower bounds for random order streams. In particular, we show that any streaming algorithm that for every > 0 estimates the number of connected components of a graph presented in a random order stream to within an · n  additive factor requires 2 Ω(1/є)  space, settling a conjecture of Peng and Sohler [SODA 2018]. We further discuss new implications of our lower bounds to other problems such as estimating size of maximum matchings and independent sets on planar graphs, random walks, as well as to stochastic streams.  

 Chaining, Group Leverage Score Overestimates, and Fast Spectral Hypergraph Sparsification   
 Arun Jambulapati 
  Yang P. Liu

  We present an algorithm that given any n  -vertex, m  -edge, rank r  hypergraph constructs a spectral sparsifier with O  ( n  ε −2  log n  log r  ) hyperedges in nearly-linear O  ( mr  ) time. This improves in both size and efficiency over a line of work [Bansal-Svensson-Trevisan 2019, Kapralov-Krauthgamer-Tardos-Yoshida 2021] for which the previous best size was O  (min{ n  ε −4  log 3  n  , nr  3  ε −2  log n  }) and runtime was O  ( mr  + n  O  (1)  ).  

 Spectral Hypergraph Sparsification via Chaining   
 James R. Lee 
  In a hypergraph on n  vertices where D  is the maximum size of a hyperedge, there is a weighted hypergraph spectral -sparsifier with at most O  ( −2  log( D  ) · n  log n  ) hyperedges. This improves over the bound of Kapralov, Krauthgamer, Tardos and Yoshida (2021) who achieve O  ( −4  n  (log n  ) 3  ), as well as the bound O  ( −2  D  3  n  log n  ) obtained by Bansal, Svensson, and Trevisan (2019). The same sparsification result was obtained independently by Jambulapati, Liu, and Sidford (2022).  

 Locally Consistent Decomposition of Strings with Applications to Edit Distance Sketching   
 Sudatta Bhattacharya 
  Michal Koucký 
  In this paper we provide a new locally consistent decomposition of strings. Each string x  is decomposed into blocks that can be described by grammars of size O  ( k  ) (using some amount of randomness). If we take two strings x  and y  of edit distance at most k  then their block decomposition uses the same number of grammars and the i  -th grammar of x  is the same as the i  -th grammar of y  except for at most k  indexes i  . The edit distance of x  and y  equals to the sum of edit distances of pairs of blocks where x  and y  differ. Our decomposition can be used to design a sketch of size O  ( k  2  ) for edit distance, and also a rolling sketch for edit distance of size O  ( k  2  ). The rolling sketch allows to update the sketched string by appending a symbol or removing a symbol from the beginning of the string.  

 Directed Isoperimetric Theorems for Boolean Functions on the Hypergrid and an Õ(n√d) Monotonicity Tester   
 Hadley Black 
  Deeparnab Chakrabarty 
  C. Seshadhri 
  The problem of testing monotonicity for Boolean functions on the hypergrid, f  :[ n  ] d   → {0,1} is a classic topic in property testing. When n  =2, the domain is the hypercube. For the hypercube case, a breakthrough result of Khot-Minzer-Safra (FOCS 2015) gave a non-adaptive, one-sided tester making O  (ε −2  √ d  ) queries. Up to polylog d  and ε factors, this bound matches the Ω(√ d  )-query non-adaptive lower bound (Chen-De-Servedio-Tan (STOC 2015), Chen-Waingarten-Xie (STOC 2017)). For any n  > 2, the optimal non-adaptive complexity was unknown. A previous result of the authors achieves a O  ( d  5/6  )-query upper bound (SODA 2020), quite far from the √ d  bound for the hypercube. In this paper, we resolve the non-adaptive complexity of monotonicity testing for all constant n  , up to poly  (ε −1  log d  ) factors. Specifically, we give a non-adaptive, one-sided monotonicity tester making O  (ε −2  n  √ d  ) queries. From a technical standpoint, we prove new directed isoperimetric theorems over the hypergrid [ n  ] d   . These results generalize the celebrated directed Talagrand inequalities that were only known for the hypercube.  

 Stochastic Minimum Vertex Cover in General Graphs: A 3/2-Approximation   
 Mahsa Derakhshan 
  Naveen Durvasula 
  Nika Haghtalab 
  We study the stochastic vertex cover problem. In this problem, G  = ( V  , E  ) is an arbitrary known graph, and G  ⋆  is an unknown random subgraph of G  where each edge e  is realized independently with probability p  . Edges of G  ⋆  can only be verified using edge queries. The goal in this problem is to find a minimum vertex cover of G  ⋆  using a small number of queries.  
 Our main result is designing an algorithm that returns a vertex cover of G  ⋆  with size at most (3/2+є) times the expected size of the minimum vertex cover, using only O  ( n  /є p  ) non-adaptive queries. This improves over the best-known 2-approximation algorithm by Behnezhad, Blum and Derakhshan [SODA’22] who also show that Ω( n  / p  ) queries are necessary to achieve any constant approximation.  
 Our guarantees also extend to instances where edge realizations are not fully independent. We complement this upperbound with a tight 3/2-approximation lower bound for stochastic graphs whose edges realizations demonstrate mild correlations.  

 Sublinear Algorithms for (1.5+𝜖)-Approximate Matching   
 Sayan Bhattacharya 
  Peter Kiss 
  Thatchaphol Saranurak 
  We study sublinear time algorithms for estimating the size of maximum matching. After a long line of research, the problem was finally settled by Behnezhad ‍[FOCS’22], in the regime where one is willing to pay an approximation factor of 2. Very recently, Behnezhad et al. ‍[SODA’23] improved the approximation factor to (2−1/2 O  (1/γ)  ) using n  1+γ  time. This improvement over the factor 2 is, however, minuscule and they asked if even 1.99-approximation is possible in n  2−Ω(1)  time.  
 We give a strong affirmative answer to this open problem by showing (1.5+є)-approximation algorithms that run in n  2−Θ(є 2  )  time. Our approach is conceptually simple and diverges from all previous sublinear-time matching algorithms: we show a sublinear time algorithm for computing a variant of the edge-degree constrained subgraph  (EDCS), a concept that has previously been exploited in dynamic [Bernstein Stein ICALP’15, SODA’16], distributed [Assadi et al. SODA’19] and streaming [Bernstein ICALP’20] settings, but never before in the sublinear setting.  

 Sublinear Time Algorithms and Complexity of Approximate Maximum Matching   
 Soheil Behnezhad 
  Mohammad Roghani 
  Aviad Rubinstein 
  Sublinear time algorithms for approximating maximum matching size have long been studied. Much of the progress over the last two decades on this problem has been on the algorithmic side. For instance, an algorithm of [Behnezhad; FOCS’21] obtains a 1/2-approximation in O  ( n  ) time for n  -vertex graphs. A more recent algorithm by [Behnezhad, Roghani, Rubinstein, and Saberi; SODA’23] obtains a slightly-better-than-1/2 approximation in O  ( n  1+є  ) time (for arbitrarily small constant ε>0). On the lower bound side, [Parnas and Ron; TCS’07] showed 15 years ago that obtaining any constant approximation of maximum matching size requires Ω( n  ) time. Proving any super-linear in n  lower bound, even for (1−є)-approximations, has remained elusive since then.  
 In this paper, we prove the first super-linear in n  lower bound for this problem. We show that at least n  1.2 − o  (1)  queries in the adjacency list model are needed for obtaining a (2/3 + Ω(1))-approximation of the maximum matching size. This holds even if the graph is bipartite and is promised to have a matching of size Θ( n  ). Our lower bound argument builds on techniques such as correlation decay  that to our knowledge have not been used before in proving sublinear time lower bounds.  
 We complement our lower bound by presenting two algorithms that run in strongly sublinear time of n  2−Ω(1)  . The first algorithm achieves a (2/3−ε)-approximation (for any arbitrarily small constant ε>0); this significantly improves prior close-to-1/2 approximations. Our second algorithm obtains an even better approximation factor of (2/3+Ω(1)) for bipartite graphs. This breaks 2/3-approximation which has been a barrier in various settings of the matching problem, and importantly shows that our n  1.2− o  (1)  time lower bound for (2/3+Ω(1))-approximations cannot be improved all the way to n  2− o  (1)  .  

 SESSION: Session 1C  
 Almost-Optimal Sublinear Additive Spanners   
 Zihan Tan 
  Tianyi Zhang 
  Given an undirected unweighted graph G  = ( V  , E  ) on n  vertices and m  edges, a subgraph H  ⊆ G  is a spanner  of G  with stretch function f  : ℝ +  → ℝ +  , iff for every pair s  , t  of vertices in V  , dist  H   ( s  , t  )≤ f  ( dist  G   ( s  , t  )). When f  ( d  ) = d  + o  ( d  ), H  is called a sublinear additive spanner  ; when f  ( d  ) = d  + o  ( n  ), H  is called an additive spanner  , and f  ( d  ) − d  is usually called the additive stretch  of H  .  
 As our primary result, we show that for any constant δ>0 and constant integer k  ≥ 2, every graph on n  vertices has a sublinear additive spanner with stretch function f  ( d  )= d  + O  ( d  1−1/ k   ) and O  ( n  1+1+δ/2 k  +1  −1  ) edges. When k  = 2, this improves upon the previous spanner construction with stretch function f  ( d  ) = d  + O  ( d  1/2  ) and Õ( n  1+3/17  ) edges [Chechik, 2013]; for any constant integer k  ≥ 3, this improves upon the previous spanner construction with stretch function f  ( d  ) = d  + O  ( d  1−1/ k   ) and O  ( n  1+(3/4) k  −2  /7 − 2· (3/4) k  −2   ) edges [Pettie, 2009]. Most importantly, the size of our spanners almost matches the lower bound of Ω( n  1+1/2 k  +1  −1  ) [Abboud, Bodwin, Pettie, 2017].  
 As our second result, we show a new construction of additive spanners with stretch O  ( n  0.403  ) and O  ( n  ) edges, which slightly improves upon the previous stretch bound of O  ( n  3/7+є  ) achieved by linear-size spanners [Bodwin and Vassilevska Williams, 2016]. An additional advantage of our spanner is that it admits a subquadratic construction runtime of Õ( m  + n  13/7  ), while the previous construction in [Bodwin and Vassilevska Williams, 2016] requires all-pairs shortest paths computation which takes O  (min{ mn  , n  2.373  }) time.  

 A Unified Framework for Light Spanners   
 Hung Le 
  Shay Solomon 
  Seminal works on light spanners over the years provide spanners with optimal lightness in various graph classes, such as in general graphs, Euclidean spanners, and minor-free graphs. Three shortcomings of previous works on light spanners are: (i) The runtimes of these constructions are almost always sub-optimal, and usually far from optimal. (ii) These constructions are optimal in the standard and crude sense, but not in a refined sense that takes into account a wider range of involved parameters. (iii) The techniques are ad hoc per graph class, and thus can’t be applied broadly.  
 This work aims at addressing these shortcomings by presenting a unified framework of light spanners in a variety of graph classes. Informally, the framework boils down to a transformation from sparse spanners to light spanners; since the state-of-the-art for sparse spanners is much more advanced than that for light spanners, such a transformation is powerful. First, we apply our framework to design fast constructions with optimal lightness for several graph classes. Second, we apply our framework to achieve more refined optimality bounds for several graph classes, i.e., the bounds remain optimal when taking into account a wider range of involved parameters, most notably є. Our new constructions are significantly better than the state-of-the-art for every examined graph class.  

 New Algorithms for All Pairs Approximate Shortest Paths   
 Liam Roditty 
  Let G  =( V  , E  ) be an unweighted undirected graph with n  vertices and m  edges. Dor, Halperin, and Zwick [FOCS 1996, SICOMP 2000] presented an (min{ n  3/2  m  1/2  , n  7/3  })-time algorithm that computes estimated distances with an additive approximation of 2 without using Fast Matrix Multiplication (FMM). Recently, Deng, Kirkpatrick, Rong, V. Williams and Zhong [ICALP 2022] improved the running time for dense graphs to ( n  2.29  )-time, using FMM, where an exact solution can be computed with FMM in ( n  ω  ) time (ω < 2.37286) using Seidel’s algorithm.  
 Since an additive 2 approximation is also a multiplicative 2 approximation, computing an additive 2 approximation is at least as hard as computing a multiplicative 2 approximation. Thus, computing a multiplicative 2 approximation might be an easier problem. Nevertheless, more than two decades after the paper of Dor, Halperin, and Zwick was first published, no faster algorithm for computing multiplicative 2 approximation in dense graphs is known, rather then simply computing an additive 2 approximation.  
 In this paper we present faster algorithms for computing a multiplicative 2 approximation without FMM. We show that in (min{ n  1/2  m  , n  9/4  }) time it is possible to compute a multiplicative 2 approximation. For distances at least 4 we can get an even faster algorithm that in (min{ n  7/4  m  1/4  , n  11/5  }) expected time computes a multiplicative 2 approximation.  
 Our algorithms are obtained by a combination of new ideas that take advantage of a careful new case analysis of the additive approximation algorithms of Dor, Halperin, and Zwick. More specifically, one of the main technical contributions we made is an analysis of the algorithm of Dor, Halperin, and Zwick that reveals certain cases in which their algorithm produces improved additive approximations without any modification. This analysis provides a full characterization of the instances for which it is harder to obtain an improved approximation. Using more ideas we can take care of some of these harder cases and to obtain an improved additive approximation also for them. Our new analysis, therefore, serves as a starting point for future research either on improved upper bounds or on conditional lower bounds.  

 Parallel Breadth-First Search and Exact Shortest Paths and Stronger Notions for Approximate Distances   
 Václav Rozhoň 
  Bernhard Haeupler 
  Anders Martinsson 
  Christoph Grunau 
  Goran Zuzic 
  This paper introduces stronger notions for approximate single-source shortest-path distances and gives simple reductions to compute them from weaker standard notions of approximate distances. Strongly-approximate distances isolate, capture, and address the well-known barriers for using approximate distances algorithmically and their reductions directly address these barriers in a clean and modular manner. The reductions are model-independent and require only log O  (1)  n  black-box approximate distance computations. They apply equally to parallel, distributed, and semi-streaming settings. Strongly (1+ε)-approximate distances are equivalent to exact distances in a (1+ε)-perturbed graph and approximately satisfy the subtractive triangle inequality. In directed graphs, this is sufficient to reduce even exact distance computation to arbitrary (1+ε)-approximate ones.  

 A New Approach to Learning Linear Dynamical Systems   
 Ainesh Bakshi 
  Allen Liu 
  Ankur Moitra 
  Morris Yau 
  Linear dynamical systems are the foundational statistical model upon which control theory is built. Both the celebrated Kalman filter and the linear quadratic regulator require knowledge of the system dynamics to provide analytic guarantees. Naturally, learning the dynamics of a linear dynamical system from linear measurements has been intensively studied since Rudolph Kalman's pioneering work in the 1960's. Towards these ends, we provide the first polynomial time algorithm for learning a linear dynamical system from a polynomial length trajectory up to polynomial error in the system parameters under essentially minimal assumptions; observability, controllability, and marginal stability. Our algorithm is built on a method of moments estimator to directly estimate Markov parameters from which the dynamics can be extracted. Furthermore we provide statistical lower bounds when our observability and controllability assumptions are violated.  

 Planning and Learning in Partially Observable Systems via Filter Stability   
 Noah Golowich 
  Ankur Moitra 
  Dhruv Rohatgi 
  Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are an important model in reinforcement learning that take into account the agent’s uncertainty about its current state. In the literature on POMDPs, it is customary to assume access to a planning oracle that computes an optimal policy when the parameters are known, even though this problem is known to be computationally hard. The major obstruction is the Curse of History  , which arises because optimal policies for POMDPs may depend on the entire observation history thus far. In this work, we revisit the planning problem and ask: Are there natural and well-motivated assumptions that avoid the Curse of History in POMDP planning (and beyond)?   
 We assume one-step observability  , which stipulates that well-separated distributions on states lead to well-separated distributions on observations. Our main technical result is a new quantitative bound for filter stability in observable Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and POMDPs ­– i.e. the rate at which the Bayes filter for the latent state forgets its initialization. We give the following algorithmic applications:  
 First, a quasipolynomial-time algorithm for planning in one-step observable POMDPs and a matching computational lower bound under the Exponential Time Hypothesis. Crucially, we require no assumptions on the transition dynamics of the POMDP.  
 Second, a quasipolynomial-time algorithm for improper learning of overcomplete HMMs, which does not require full-rank transitions; full-rankness is violated, for instance, when the number of latent states varies over time. Instead we assume multi-step observability, a generalization of observability which allows observations to be informative in aggregate.  
 Third, a quasipolynomial-time algorithm for computing approximate coarse correlated equilibria in one-step observable Partially Observable Markov Games (POMGs).  
 Thus we show that observability gives a blueprint for circumventing computational intractability in a variety of settings with partial observations, including planning, learning and computing equilibria.  

 Optimistic MLE: A Generic Model-Based Algorithm for Partially Observable Sequential Decision Making   
 Qinghua Liu 
  Praneeth Netrapalli 
  Csaba Szepesvari 
  Chi Jin 
  This paper introduces a simple efficient learning algorithms for general sequential decision making. The algorithm combines Optimism for exploration with Maximum Likelihood Estimation for model estimation, which is thus named OMLE. We prove that OMLE learns the near-optimal policies of an enormously rich class of sequential decision making problems in a polynomial number of samples. This rich class includes not only a majority of known tractable model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems (such as tabular MDPs, factored MDPs, low witness rank problems, tabular weakly-revealing/observable POMDPs and multi-step decodable POMDPs ), but also many new challenging RL problems especially in the partially observable setting that were not previously known to be tractable.  
 Notably, the new problems addressed by this paper include (1) observable POMDPs with continuous observation and function approximation, where we achieve the first sample complexity that is completely independent of the size of observation space; (2) well-conditioned low-rank sequential decision making problems (also known as Predictive State Representations (PSRs)), which include and generalize all known tractable POMDP examples under a more intrinsic representation; (3) general sequential decision making problems under SAIL condition, which unifies our existing understandings of model-based RL in both fully observable and partially observable settings. SAIL condition is identified by this paper, which can be viewed as a natural generalization of Bellman/witness rank to address partial observability. This paper also presents a reward-free variant of OMLE algorithm, which learns approximate dynamic models that enable the computation of near-optimal policies for all reward functions simultaneously.  

 Weighted Edit Distance Computation: Strings, Trees, and Dyck

  MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi 
  Tomasz Kociumaka 
  Barna Saha 
  Given two strings of length n  over alphabet Σ, and an upper bound k  on their edit distance, the algorithm of Myers (Algorithmica’86) and Landau and Vishkin (JCSS’88) from almost forty years back computes the unweighted string edit distance in O  ( n  + k  2  ) time. To date, it remains the fastest algorithm for exact edit distance computation, and it is optimal under the Strong Exponential Hypothesis (Backurs and Indyk; STOC’15). Over the years, this result has inspired many developments, including fast approximation algorithms for string edit distance as well as similar Õ( n  + poly  ( k  ))-time algorithms for generalizations to tree and Dyck edit distances. Surprisingly, all these results hold only for unweighted instances.  
 While unweighted edit distance is theoretically fundamental, almost all real-world applications require weighted edit distance, where different weights are assigned to different edit operations (insertions, deletions, and substitutions), and the weights may vary with the characters being edited. Given a weight function w  : Σ∪{ε} × Σ∪{ε} → ℝ ≥ 0  (such that w  ( a  , a  ) = 0 and w  ( a  , b  ) ≥ 1 for all a  , b  ∈ Σ∪{ε} with a  ≠ b  ), the goal is to find an alignment that minimizes the total weight of edits. Except for the vanilla O  ( n  2  )-time dynamic-programming algorithm and its almost trivial O  ( nk  )-time implementation ( k  being an upper bound on the sought total weight), none of the aforementioned developments on the unweighted edit distance applies to the weighted variant.  
 In this paper, we propose the first O  ( n  + poly  ( k  ))-time algorithm that computes the weighted string edit distance exactly, thus bridging a fundamental decades-old gap between our understanding of unweighted and weighted edit distance. We then generalize this result to the weighted tree and Dyck edit distances, bringing in several new techniques, which lead to a deterministic algorithm that improves upon the previous work even for unweighted tree edit distance. Given how fundamental weighted edit distance is, we believe our O  ( n  + poly  ( k  ))-time algorithm will be instrumental for further significant developments in the area.  

 Stronger 3-SUM Lower Bounds for Approximate Distance Oracles via Additive Combinatorics   
 Amir Abboud 
  Karl Bringmann 
  Nick Fischer 
  The “short cycle removal” technique was recently introduced by Abboud, Bringmann, Khoury and Zamir (STOC ’22) to prove fine-grained hardness of approximation. Its main technical result is that listing all triangles in an n  1/2  -regular graph is n  2− o  (1)  -hard even when the number of short cycles is small; namely, when the number of k  -cycles is O  ( n  k  /2+γ  ) for γ<1/2. Its corollaries are based on the 3-SUM conjecture and their strength depends on γ, i.e. on how effectively the short cycles are removed.  
 Abboud et al. achieve γ≥ 1/4 by applying structure versus randomness arguments on graphs. In this paper, we take a step back and apply conceptually similar arguments on the numbers  of the 3-SUM problem, from which the hardness of triangle listing is derived. Consequently, we achieve the best possible ‍γ=0 and the following lower bound corollaries under the 3-SUM conjecture:  
 * Approximate distance oracles:  The seminal Thorup-Zwick distance oracles achieve stretch 2 k  ± O  (1) after preprocessing a graph in O  ( m  n  1/ k   ) time. For the same stretch, and assuming the query time is ‍ n  o  (1)  Abboud et al. proved an Ω( m  1+1/12.7552 · k   ) lower bound on the preprocessing time; we improve it to Ω( m  1+1/2 k   ) which is only a factor ‍2 away from the upper bound. Additionally, we obtain tight bounds for stretch 2+ o  (1) and 3−є and higher lower bounds for dynamic shortest paths.  
 * Listing 4-cycles:  Abboud et al. proved the first super-linear lower bound for listing all 4-cycles in a graph, ruling out ( m  1.1927  + t  ) 1+ o  (1)  time algorithms where t  is the number of 4-cycles. We settle the complexity of this basic problem by showing that the O  (min( m  4/3  , n  2  ) + t  ) upper bound is tight up to n  o  (1)  factors.  
 Our results exploit a rich tool set from additive combinatorics, most notably the Balog-Szemerédi-Gowers theorem and Rusza’s covering lemma. A key ingredient that may be of independent interest is a truly subquadratic algorithm for 3-SUM if one of the sets has small doubling.  

 Removing Additive Structure in 3SUM-Based Reductions   
 Ce Jin 
  Yinzhan Xu 
  Our work explores the hardness of 3SUM instances without certain additive structures, and its applications. As our main technical result, we show that solving 3SUM on a size- n  integer set that avoids solutions to a  + b  = c  + d  for { a  , b  } ≠ { c  , d  } still requires n  2− o  (1)  time, under the 3SUM hypothesis. Such sets are called Sidon sets and are well-studied in the field of additive combinatorics.  
 Combined with previous reductions, this implies that the All-Edges Sparse Triangle problem on n  -vertex graphs with maximum degree √ n  and at most n  k  /2  k  -cycles for every k  ≥ 3 requires n  2− o  (1)  time, under the 3SUM hypothesis. This can be used to strengthen the previous conditional lower bounds by Abboud, Bringmann, Khoury, and Zamir [STOC’22] of 4-Cycle Enumeration, Offline Approximate Distance Oracle and Approximate Dynamic Shortest Path. In particular, we show that no algorithm for the 4-Cycle Enumeration problem on n  -vertex m  -edge graphs with n  o  (1)  delays has O  ( n  2−ε  ) or O  ( m  4/3−ε  ) pre-processing time for ε >0. We also present a matching upper bound via simple modifications of the known algorithms for 4-Cycle Detection.  
 A slight generalization of the main result also extends the result of Dudek, Gawrychowski, and Starikovskaya [STOC’20] on the 3SUM hardness of nontrivial 3-Variate Linear Degeneracy Testing (3-LDTs): we show 3SUM hardness for all nontrivial 4-LDTs.  
 The proof of our main technical result combines a wide range of tools: Balog-Szemerédi-Gowers theorem, sparse convolution algorithm, and a new almost-linear hash function with almost 3-universal guarantee for integers that do not have small-coefficient linear relations.  

 Fredman’s Trick Meets Dominance Product: Fine-Grained Complexity of Unweighted APSP, 3SUM Counting, and More   
 Timothy M. Chan 
  Virginia Vassilevska Williams 
  Yinzhan Xu 
  In this paper we carefully combine Fredman’s trick [SICOMP’76] and Matoušek’s approach for dominance product [IPL’91] to obtain powerful results in fine-grained complexity.  
 Under the hypothesis that APSP for undirected graphs with edge weights in {1, 2, …, n  } requires n  3− o  (1)  time (when ω=2), we show a variety of conditional lower bounds, including an n  7/3− o  (1)  lower bound for unweighted directed APSP and an n  2.2− o  (1)  lower bound for computing the Minimum Witness Product between two n  × n  Boolean matrices, even if ω=2, improving upon their trivial n  2  lower bounds. Our techniques can also be used to reduce the unweighted directed APSP problem to other problems. In particular, we show that (when ω = 2), if unweighted directed APSP requires n  2.5− o  (1)  time, then Minimum Witness Product requires n  7/3− o  (1)  time.  
 We show that, surprisingly, many central problems in fine-grained complexity are equivalent to their natural counting versions. In particular, we show that Min-Plus Product and Exact Triangle are subcubically equivalent to their counting versions, and 3SUM is subquadratically equivalent to its counting version.  
 We also obtain new algorithms using new variants of the Balog-Szemerédi-Gowers theorem from additive combinatorics. For example, we get an O  ( n  3.83  ) time deterministic algorithm for exactly counting the number of shortest paths in an arbitrary weighted graph, improving the textbook O  ( n  4  ) time algorithm. We also get faster algorithms for 3SUM in preprocessed universes, and deterministic algorithms for 3SUM on monotone sets in {1, 2, …, n  } d   .

 Faster Isomorphism for 𝑝-Groups of Class 2 and Exponent 𝑝   
 Xiaorui Sun 
  The group isomorphism problem determines whether two groups, given by their Cayley tables, are isomorphic. For groups with order n  , an algorithm with n  (log n  + O  (1))  running time, attributed to Tarjan, was proposed in the 1970s (Miller, STOC 1978). Despite the extensive study over the past decades, the current best group isomorphism algorithm has an n  (1 / 4 + o  (1))log n   running time (Rosenbaum 2013).  
 The isomorphism testing for p  -groups of (nilpotent) class 2 and exponent p  has been identified as a major barrier to obtaining an n  o  (log n  )  time algorithm for the group isomorphism problem. Although the p  -groups of class 2 and exponent p  have much simpler algebraic structures than general groups, the best-known isomorphism testing algorithm for this group class also has an n  O  (log n  )  running time.  
 In this paper, we present an isomorphism testing algorithm for p  -groups of class 2 and exponent p  with running time n  O  ((log n  ) 5/6  )  for any prime p  > 2. Our result is based on a novel reduction to the skew-symmetric matrix tuple isometry problem (Ivanyos and Qiao, SIAM J. Computing, 2019). To obtain the reduction, we develop several tools for matrix space analysis, including a matrix space individualization-refinement method and a characterization of the low rank matrix spaces.  

 Linear Independence, Alternants, and Applications   
 Vishwas Bhargava 
  Shubhangi Saraf 
  Ilya Volkovich 
  We develop a new technique for analyzing linear independence of multivariate polynomials. One of our main technical contributions is a Small Witness for Linear Independence  (SWLI) lemma which states the following. If the polynomials f  1  , f  2  , …, f  k   ∈ F  [ X  ] over X  ={ x  1  , …, x  n   } are F  -linearly independent then there exists a subset S  ⊆ X  of size at most k  −1 such that f  1  , f  2  , …, f  k   are also F  ( X  ∖ S  )-linearly independent.  
 We show how to effectively combine this lemma with the use of the alternant  matrix to analyze linear independence of polynomials. We also give applications of our technique to the questions of polynomial identity testing and arithmetic circuit reconstruction. 1) We give a general technique for lifting efficient polynomial identity testing algorithms from basic classes of circuits, satisfying some closure properties, to more general classes of circuits. As one of the corollaries of this result, we obtain the first algorithm for polynomial identity testing for depth-4, constant-occur circuits that works over all fields. This strengthens a result by [ASSS ’16] ( STOC ’12  ) that works in the case when the characteristic is 0 or sufficiently large. Another corollary is an identity testing algorithm for a special case of depth-5 circuits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm for this class of circuits. 2) We give new and efficient black-box reconstruction algorithms for the class of set-multilinear depth-3 circuits of constant top fan-in, where the set-multilinear variable partition is unknown  . This generalizes the results of [BSV ’21] ( STOC ’21  ) and [PSV ’22] ( ECCC ’22  ) which work in the case of known variable partition, and correspond to tensor decomposition of constant-rank tensors.  

 Faster Walsh-Hadamard and Discrete Fourier Transforms from Matrix Non-rigidity   
 Josh Alman 
  Kevin Rao 
  We give algorithms with lower arithmetic operation counts for both the Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT) and the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) on inputs of power-of-2 size N  .  
 For the WHT, our new algorithm has an operation count of 23/24 N  log N  + O  ( N  ). To our knowledge, this gives the first improvement on the N  log N  operation count of the simple, folklore Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform algorithm.  
 For the DFT, our new FFT algorithm uses 15/4 N  log N  + O  ( N  ) real arithmetic operations. Our leading constant 15/4 = 3.75 improves on the leading constant of 5 from the Cooley-Tukey algorithm from 1965, leading constant 4 from the split-radix algorithm of Yavne from 1968, leading constant 34/9=3.7777 from a modification of the split-radix algorithm by Van Buskirk from 2004, and leading constant 3.76875 from a theoretically optimized version of Van Buskirk’s algorithm by Sergeev from 2017.  
 Our new WHT algorithm takes advantage of a recent line of work on the non-rigidity of the WHT: we decompose the WHT matrix as the sum of a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix, and then analyze the structures of these matrices to achieve a lower operation count. Our new DFT algorithm comes from a novel reduction, showing that parts of the previous best FFT algorithms can be replaced by calls to an algorithm for the WHT. Replacing the folklore WHT algorithm with our new improved algorithm leads to our improved FFT.  

 A Borsuk-Ulam Lower Bound for Sign-Rank and Its Applications   
 Hamed Hatami 
  Kaave Hosseini 
  Xiang Meng 
  We introduce a new topological argument based on the Borsuk-Ulam theorem to prove a lower bound on sign-rank.  
 This result implies the strongest possible separation between randomized and unbounded-error communication complexity. More precisely, we show that for a particular range of parameters, the randomized communication complexity of the Gap Hamming Distance problem is O  (1) while its unbounded-error communication complexity is Ω(log( n  )). Previously, it was unknown whether the unbounded-error communication complexity could be asymptotically larger than the randomized communication  
 In connection to learning theory, we prove that, despite its learnability properties, the class of large margin half-spaces in ℝ d   is genuinely high-dimensional, i.e., it cannot be embedded in d  −1  . This result is closely related to a recent conjecture of Alon, Hanneke, Holzman, and Moran (FOCS 2021) about the VC dimension of this class.  
 Our final application is to the theory of dimension reductions. The Johnson-Lindenstrauss theorem implies that any set of N  unit vectors is embeddable in dimension O  (γ −2  log N  ) without altering the signs of those pairwise inner products that have absolute values at least γ>0. Our result establishes the tightness of this bound, which answers a question of Linial, Mendelson, Schechtman, and Shraibman (Combinatorica, 27(2007)) in the case of partial functions.

 Optimal Differentially Private Learning of Thresholds and Quasi-Concave Optimization   
 Edith Cohen 
  Xin Lyu 
  Jelani Nelson 
  Tamás Sarlós 
  Uri Stemmer 
  The problem of learning threshold functions is a fundamental one in machine learning. Classical learning theory implies sample complexity of O  (ξ −1  log(1/β)) (for generalization error ξ with confidence 1−β). The private version of the problem, however, is more challenging and in particular, the sample complexity must depend on the size | X  | of the domain. Progress on quantifying this dependence, via lower and upper bounds, was made in a line of works over the past decade. In this paper, we finally close the gap for approximate-DP and provide a nearly tight upper bound of O  (log *  | X  |), which matches a lower bound by Alon et al (that applies even with improper learning) and improves over a prior upper bound of O  ((log *  | X  |) 1.5  ) by Kaplan et al. We also provide matching upper and lower bounds of Θ(2 log *  | X  |  ) for the additive error of private quasi-concave optimization (a related and more general problem). Our improvement is achieved via the novel Reorder-Slice-Compute paradigm for private data analysis which we believe will have further applications.  

 Privately Estimating a Gaussian: Efficient, Robust, and Optimal

  Pranay Tankala 
  Prayaag Venkat 
  Fred Zhang 
  In this work, we give efficient algorithms for privately estimating a Gaussian distribution in both pure and approximate differential privacy (DP) models with optimal dependence on the dimension in the sample complexity.  
 In the pure DP setting, we give an efficient algorithm that estimates an unknown d  -dimensional Gaussian distribution up to an arbitrary tiny total variation error using O  ( d  2  logκ) samples while tolerating a constant fraction of adversarial outliers. Here, κ is the condition number of the target covariance matrix. The sample bound matches best non-private estimators in the dependence on the dimension (up to a polylogarithmic factor). We prove a new lower bound on differentially private covariance estimation to show that the dependence on the condition number κ in the above sample bound is also tight. Prior to our work, only identifiability results (yielding inefficient super-polynomial time algorithms) were known for the problem.  
 In the approximate DP setting, we give an efficient algorithm to estimate an unknown Gaussian distribution up to an arbitrarily tiny total variation error using O  ( d  2  ) samples while tolerating a constant fraction of adversarial outliers. Prior to our work, all efficient approximate DP algorithms incurred a super-quadratic sample cost or were not outlier-robust. For the special case of mean estimation, our algorithm achieves the optimal sample complexity of O  ( d  ), improving on a O  ( d  1.5  ) bound from prior work.  
 Our pure DP algorithm relies on a recursive private preconditioning subroutine that utilizes recent work of Hopkins et al. (STOC 2022) on private mean estimation. Our approximate DP algorithms are based on a substantial upgrade of the method of stabilizing convex relaxations introduced by Kothari et al. (COLT 2022). In particular, we improve on their mechanism by using a new unnormalized entropy regularization and a new and surprisingly simple mechanism for privately releasing covariances.  

 Robustness Implies Privacy in Statistical Estimation   
 Samuel B. Hopkins

  We study the relationship between adversarial robustness and differential privacy in high-dimensional algorithmic statistics. We give the first black-box reduction from privacy to robustness  which can produce private estimators with optimal tradeoffs among sample complexity, accuracy, and privacy for a wide range of fundamental high-dimensional parameter estimation problems, including mean and covariance estimation. We show that this reduction can be implemented in polynomial time in some important special cases. In particular, using nearly-optimal polynomial-time robust estimators for the mean and covariance of high-dimensional Gaussians which are based on the Sum-of-Squares method, we design the first polynomial-time private estimators for these problems with nearly-optimal samples-accuracy-privacy tradeoffs. Our algorithms are also robust to a nearly optimal fraction of adversarially-corrupted samples.  

 Concurrent Composition Theorems for Differential Privacy   
 Salil Vadhan 
  Wanrong Zhang 
  We study the concurrent composition properties of interactive differentially private mechanisms, whereby an adversary can arbitrarily interleave its queries to the different mechanisms. We prove that all composition theorems for non-interactive differentially private mechanisms extend to the concurrent composition of interactive differentially private mechanisms, whenever differential privacy is measured using the hypothesis testing framework of f  -DP, which captures standard (,δ)-DP as a special case. We prove the concurrent composition theorem by showing that every interactive f  -DP mechanism can be simulated by interactive post-processing of a non-interactive f  -DP mechanism.  
 In concurrent and independent work, Lyu (NeurIPS ‘22) proves a similar result to ours for (,δ)-DP, as well as a concurrent composition theorem for Rényi DP. We also provide a simple proof of Lyu’s concurrent composition theorem for Rényi DP. Lyu leaves the general case of f  -DP as an open problem, which we solve in this paper.  

 Stability Is Stable: Connections between Replicability, Privacy, and Adaptive Generalization

  The notion of replicable algorithms was introduced by Impagliazzo, Lei, Pitassi, and Sorrell (STOC’22) to describe randomized algorithms that are stable under the resampling of their inputs. More precisely, a replicable algorithm gives the same output with high probability when its randomness is fixed and it is run on a new i.i.d. sample drawn from the same distribution. Using replicable algorithms for data analysis can facilitate the verification of published results by ensuring that the results of an analysis will be the same with high probability, even when that analysis is performed on a new data set.  
 In this work, we establish new connections and separations between replicability and standard notions of algorithmic stability. In particular, we give sample-efficient algorithmic reductions between perfect generalization, approximate differential privacy, and replicability for a broad class of statistical problems. Conversely, we show any such equivalence must break down computationally: there exist statistical problems that are easy under differential privacy, but that cannot be solved replicably without breaking public-key cryptography. Furthermore, these results are tight: our reductions are statistically optimal, and we show that any computational separation between DP and replicability must imply the existence of one-way functions.  
 Our statistical reductions give a new algorithmic framework for translating between notions of stability, which we instantiate to answer several open questions in replicability and privacy. This includes giving sample-efficient replicable algorithms for various PAC learning, distribution estimation, and distribution testing problems, algorithmic amplification of δ in approximate DP, conversions from item-level to user-level privacy, and the existence of private agnostic-to-realizable learning reductions under structured distributions.

 An Improved Parameterized Algorithm for Treewidth   
 Tuukka Korhonen 
  Daniel Lokshtanov 
  We give an algorithm that takes as input an n  -vertex graph G  and an integer k  , runs in time 2 O  ( k  2  )  n  O  (1)  , and outputs a tree decomposition of G  of width at most k  , if such a decomposition exists. This resolves the long-standing open problem of whether there is a 2 o  ( k  3  )  n  O  (1)  time algorithm for treewidth. In particular, our algorithm is the first improvement on the dependency on k  in algorithms for treewidth since the 2 O  ( k  3  )  n  O  (1)  time algorithm given by Bodlaender and Kloks [ICALP 1991] and Lagergren and Arnborg [ICALP 1991].  
 We also give an algorithm that given an n  -vertex graph G  , an integer k  , and a rational ε ∈ (0,1), in time k  O  ( k  /ε)  n  O  (1)  either outputs a tree decomposition of G  of width at most (1+ε) k  or determines that the treewidth of G  is larger than k  . Prior to our work, no approximation algorithms for treewidth with approximation ratio less than 2, other than the exact algorithms, were known. Both of our algorithms work in polynomial space.  

 The Complexity of Pattern Counting in Directed Graphs, Parameterised by the Outdegree   
 Marco Bressan 
  Matthias Lanzinger 
  Marc Roth 
  We study the fixed-parameter tractability of the following fundamental problem: given two directed graphs H  →  and G  →  , count the number of copies of H  →  in G  →  . The standard setting, where the tractability is well understood, uses only | H  →  | as a parameter. In this paper we adopt as a parameter | H  →  |+ d  ( G  →  ), where d  ( G  →  ) is the maximum outdegree of | G  →  |. Under this parameterisation, we completely characterize the fixed-parameter tractability of the problem in both its non-induced and induced versions through two novel structural parameters, the fractional cover number ρ *  and the source number α s   . On the one hand we give algorithms with running time f  (| H  →  |, d  ( G  →  )) · | G  →  | ρ *  ( H  →  )+ O  (1)  and f  (| H  →  |, d  ( G  →  )) · | G  →  | α s   ( H  →  )+ O  (1)  for counting respectively the copies and induced copies of H  →  in G  →  ; on the other hand we show that, unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails, for any class C  →  of directed graphs the restriction of the problem to patterns in C  →  is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if ρ *  ( C  →  ) is bounded (α s   ( C  →  ) for the induced version). These results explain how the orientation of the pattern can make counting easy or hard, and prove that a classic algorithm by Chiba and Nishizeki and its extensions (Chiba and Nishizeki, SICOMP ’85; Bressan, Algorithmica ’21) are optimal unless ETH fails.  
 Our proofs consist of several layers of parameterised reductions that preserve the outdegree of the host graph. To start with, we establish a tight connection between counting homomorphisms from H  →  to G  →  to #CSP, the problem of counting solutions of constraint satisfactions problems, for special classes of patterns that we call canonical DAGs. To lift these results from canonical DAGs to arbitrary directed graphs, we exploit a combination of several ingredients: existing results for #CSPs (Marx JACM 13; Grohe, Marx TALG 14), an extension of graph motif parameters (Curticapean, Dell, Marx STOC 17) to our setting, the introduction of what we call monotone reversible minors, and a careful analysis of quotients of directed graphs in order to relate their adaptive width and fractional hypertreewidth to our novel parameters. Along the route we establish a novel bound of the integrality gap for the fractional independence number of hypergraphs based on adaptive width, which might be of independent interest.  

 Parameterized Inapproximability of the Minimum Distance Problem over All Fields and the Shortest Vector Problem in All ℓp Norms   
 Huck Bennett 
  Mahdi Cheraghchi 
  Venkatesan Guruswami 
  João Ribeiro 
  We prove that the Minimum Distance Problem (MDP) on linear codes over any fixed finite field and parameterized by the input distance bound is W  [1]-hard to approximate within any constant factor. We also prove analogous results for the parameterized Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) on integer lattices. Specifically, we prove that SVP in the ℓ p   norm is W  [1]-hard to approximate within any constant factor for any fixed p  >1 and W  [1]-hard to approximate within a factor approaching 2 for p  =1. (We show hardness under randomized reductions in each case.)  
 These results answer the main questions left open (and explicitly posed) by Bhattacharyya, Bonnet, Egri, Ghoshal, Karthik C. S., Lin, Manurangsi, and Marx (Journal of the ACM, 2021) on the complexity of parameterized MDP and SVP. For MDP, they established similar hardness for binary linear codes and left the case of general fields open. For SVP in ℓ p   norms with p  > 1, they showed inapproximability within some constant factor (depending on p  ) and left open showing such hardness for arbitrary constant factors. They also left open showing W[1]-hardness even of exact SVP in the ℓ 1  norm.  

 First-Order Model Checking on Structurally Sparse Graph Classes   
 Jan Dreier 
  Nikolas Mählmann 
  Sebastian Siebertz 
  A class of graphs is structurally nowhere dense if it can be constructed from a nowhere dense class by a first-order transduction. Structurally nowhere dense classes vastly generalize nowhere dense classes and constitute important examples of monadically stable classes. We show that the first-order model checking problem is fixed-parameter tractable on every structurally nowhere dense class of graphs.  
 Our result builds on a recently developed game-theoretic characterization of monadically stable graph classes. As a second key ingredient of independent interest, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for approximating weak neighborhood covers (on general graphs). We combine the two tools into a recursive locality-based model checking algorithm. This algorithm is efficient on every monadically stable graph class admitting flip-closed sparse weak neighborhood covers, where flip-closure is a mild additional assumption. Thereby, establishing efficient first-order model checking on monadically stable classes is reduced to proving the existence of flip-closed sparse weak neighborhood covers on these classes -- a purely combinatorial problem. We complete the picture by proving the existence of the desired covers for structurally nowhere dense classes: we show that every structurally nowhere dense class can be sparsified by contracting local sets of vertices, enabling us to lift the existence of covers from sparse classes.

 The Randomized 𝑘-Server Conjecture Is False!   
 Sébastien Bubeck 
  Christian Coester 
  Yuval Rabani 
  We prove a few new lower bounds on the randomized competitive ratio for the k  -server problem and other related problems, resolving some long-standing conjectures. In particular, for metrical task systems (MTS) we asympotically settle the competitive ratio and obtain the first improvement to an existential lower bound since the introduction of the model 35 years ago (in 1987).  
 More concretely, we show: (1) There exist ( k  +1)-point metric spaces in which the randomized competitive ratio for the k  -server problem is Ω(log 2  k  ). This refutes the folklore conjecture (which is known to hold in some families of metrics) that in all metric spaces with at least k  +1 points, the competitive ratio is Θ(log k  ). (2) Consequently, there exist n  -point metric spaces in which the randomized competitive ratio for MTS is Ω(log 2  n  ). This matches the upper bound that holds for all metrics. The previously best existential lower bound was Ω(log n  ) (which was known to be tight for some families of metrics). (3) For all k  < n  ∈, for all  n  -point metric spaces the randomized k  -server competitive ratio is at least Ω(log k  ), and consequently the randomized MTS competitive ratio is at least Ω(log n  ). These universal lower bounds are asymptotically tight. The previous bounds were Ω(log k  /loglog k  ) and Ω(log n  /loglog n  ), respectively. (4) The randomized competitive ratio for the w  -set metrical service systems problem, and its equivalent width- w  layered graph traversal problem, is Ω( w  2  ). This slightly improves the previous lower bound and matches the recently discovered upper bound. (5) Our results imply improved lower bounds for other problems like k  -taxi, distributed paging, and metric allocation.  
 These lower bounds share a common thread, and other than the third bound, also a common construction.  

 Doubly Efficient Private Information Retrieval and Fully Homomorphic RAM Computation from Ring LWE   
 Wei-Kai Lin 
  Ethan Mook 
  Daniel Wichs 
  A (single server) private information retrieval (PIR)  allows a client to read data from a public database held on a remote server, without revealing to the server which locations she is reading. In a doubly efficient PIR (DEPIR)  , the database is first preprocessed, but the server can subsequently answer any client’s query in time that is sub-linear in the database size. Prior work gave a plausible candidate for a public-key  variant of DEPIR, where a trusted party is needed to securely preprocess the database and generate a corresponding public key for the clients; security relied on a new non-standard code-based assumption and a heuristic use of ideal obfuscation. In this work we construct the stronger unkeyed  notion of DEPIR, where the preprocessing is a deterministic procedure that the server can execute on its own. Moreover, we prove security under just the standard ring learning-with-errors (RingLWE)  assumption. For a database of size N  and any constant ε>0, the preprocessing run-time and size is O  ( N  1+ε  ), while the run-time and communication-complexity of each PIR query is poly  log( N  ). We also show how to update the preprocessed database in time O  ( N  ε  ). Our approach is to first construct a standard PIR where the server’s computation consists of evaluating a multivariate polynomial; we then convert it to a DEPIR by preprocessing the polynomial to allow for fast evaluation, using the techniques of Kedlaya and Umans (STOC ’08).  
 Building on top of our DEPIR, we construct general fully homomorphic encryption for random-access machines (RAM-FHE)  , which allows a server to homomorphically evaluate an arbitrary RAM program P  over a client’s encrypted input x  and the server’s preprocessed plaintext input y  to derive an encryption of the output P  ( x  , y  ) in time that scales with the RAM run-time of the computation rather than its circuit size. Prior work only gave a heuristic candidate construction of a restricted notion of RAM-FHE. In this work, we construct RAM-FHE under the RingLWE assumption with circular security. For a RAM program P  with worst-case run-time T  , the homomorphic evaluation runs in time T  1+ε  · (| x  | + | y  |).

 SDPs and Robust Satisfiability of Promise CSP   
 Joshua Brakensiek 
  Venkatesan Guruswami 
  Sai Sandeep 
  For a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), a robust satisfaction algorithm is one that outputs an assignment satisfying most of the constraints on instances that are near-satisfiable. It is known that the CSPs that admit efficient robust satisfaction algorithms are precisely those of bounded width, i.e., CSPs whose satisfiability can be checked by a simple local consistency algorithm (eg., 2-SAT or Horn-SAT in the Boolean case). While the exact satisfiability of a bounded width CSP can be checked by combinatorial algorithms, the robust algorithm is based on rounding a canonical Semi Definite Programming(SDP) relaxation.  
 In this work, we initiate the study of robust satisfaction algorithms for promise CSPs, which are a vast generalization of CSPs that have received much attention recently. The motivation is to extend the theory beyond CSPs, as well as to better understand the power of SDPs. We present robust SDP rounding algorithms under some general conditions, namely the existence of majority or alternating threshold polymorphisms. On the hardness front, we prove that the lack of such polymorphisms makes the PCSP hard for all pairs of symmetric Boolean predicates. Our method involves a novel method to argue SDP gaps via the absence of certain colorings of the sphere, with connections to sphere Ramsey theory.  
 We conjecture that PCSPs with robust satisfaction algorithms are precisely those for which the feasibility of the canonical SDP implies (exact) satisfiability. We also give a precise algebraic condition, known as a minion characterization, of which PCSPs have the latter property.  

 Approximate Graph Colouring and the Hollow Shadow   
 Lorenzo Ciardo 
  Stanislav Živný 
  We show that approximate graph colouring is not solved by constantly many levels of the lift-and-project hierarchy for the combined basic linear programming and affine integer programming relaxation. The proof involves a construction of tensors whose fixed-dimensional projections are equal up to reflection and satisfy a sparsity condition, which may be of independent interest.  

 On Approximability of Satisfiable k-CSPs: II   
 Amey Bhangale 
  Subhash Khot 
  Dor Minzer 
  Let Σ be an alphabet and µ be a distribution on Σ k   for some k  ≥ 2. Let α > 0 be the minimum probability of a tuple in the support of µ (denoted supp  (µ)). Here, the support of µ is the set of all tuples in Σ k   that have a positive probability mass under µ. We treat the parameters Σ, k  , µ, α as fixed and constant.  
 We say that the distribution µ has a linear embedding if there exist an Abelian group G  (with the identity element 0 G   ) and mappings σ i   : Σ → G  , 1 ≤ i  ≤ k  , such that at least one of the mappings is non-constant and for every ( a  1  , a  2  , …, a  k   )∈ supp  (µ), ∑ i  =1  k   σ i   ( a  i   ) = 0 G   .  
 Let f  i   : Σ n   → [−1,1] be bounded functions, such that at least one of the functions f  i   essentially has degree at least d  , meaning that the Fourier mass of f  i   on terms of degree less than d  is negligible, say at most δ. In particular, |E[ f  i   ]| ≤ δ. The Fourier representation is w.r.t. the marginal of µ on the i  th   co-ordinate, denoted (Σ, µ i   ). If µ has no linear embedding (over any Abelian group), then is it necessarily the case that  
 |E ( x  1  , x  2  , …, x  k   )∼ µ ⊗ n    [ f  1  ( x  1  ) f  2  ( x  2  )⋯ f  k   ( x  k   )] = o  d  , δ  (1),  
 where the right hand side → 0 as the degree d  → ∞ and δ → 0?  
 In this paper, we answer this analytical question fully and in the affirmative for k  =3. We also show the following two applications of the result. The first application is related to hardness of approximation. We show that for every 3-ary predicate P  :Σ 3  → {0,1} such that P  has no linear embedding, an SDP integrality gap instance  of a P  -CSP instance with gap (1, s  ) can be translated into a dictatorship test with completeness 1 and soundness s  + o  (1), under certain additional conditions on the instance. The second application is related to additive combinatorics. We show that if the distribution µ on Σ 3  has no linear embedding, marginals of µ are uniform on Σ, and ( a  , a  , a  )∈ supp  (µ) for every a  ∈ Σ, then every large enough subset of Σ n   contains a triple ( x  1  , x  2  , x  3  ) from µ ⊗ n   (and in fact a significant density of such triples).  

 On Approximability of Satisfiable k-CSPs: III   
 Amey Bhangale 
  Subhash Khot 
  Dor Minzer 
  In this paper we study functions on the Boolean hypercube that have the property that after applying certain random restrictions, the restricted function is correlated to a linear function with non-negligible probability. If the given function is correlated with a linear function then this property clearly holds. Furthermore, the property also holds for low-degree functions as low-degree functions become a constant function under a random restriction with a non-negligible probability. We show that this essentially is the only possible reason. More specifically, we show that the function must be correlated to a product of a linear function and a low-degree function. One of the main motivations of studying this question comes from the recent work of the authors towards understanding approximability of satisfiable Constraint Satisfaction Problems.  
 Towards proving our structural theorem, we analyze a 2-query direct product test for the table F  : [ n  ] qn  → {0,1} qn   where q  ∈ (0,1). We show that, for every constant ε>0, if the test passes with probability ε>0, then there is a global function g  : [ n  ]→ {0,1} such that for at least δ(ε) fraction of sets, the global function g  agrees with the given table on all except  α(ε) many locations  . The novelty of this result lies in the fact that α(ε) is independent of the set sizes. Prior to our work, such a conclusion (in fact, a stronger conclusion with α = 0) was shown by Dinur, Filmus, and Harsha albeit when the test accepts with probability 1−ε for a small constant ε>0. The setting of parameters in our direct product tests is fundamentally different compared to the previous results and hence our analysis involves new techniques, including the use of the small-set expansion property of graphs defined on multi-slices.  
 As one application of our structural result, we give a 4-query linearity test under the p  -biased distribution. More specifically, for any p  ∈ (1/3,2/3), we give a test that queries a given function f  : {0,1} n   → {0,1} at 4 locations, where the marginal distribution of each query is µ p   ⊗ n   . The test has perfect completeness and soundness 1/2+ε – in other words, for every constant ε>0, if the test passes with probability at least 1/2+ε, then the function f  is correlated to a linear function under the µ p   ⊗ n   measure. This qualitatively improves the results on the linearity testing under the p  -biased distribution from the previous work where the authors studied the test with soundness 1−ε, for ε close to 0.  

 An Analogue of Bonami’s Lemma for Functions on Spaces of Linear Maps, and 2-2 Games   
 David Ellis 
  Guy Kindler 
  Noam Lifshitz 
  We prove an analogue of Bonami’s (hypercontractive) lemma for complex-valued functions on L (𝑉 ,𝑊 ), where 𝑉 and 𝑊 are vector spaces over a finite field. This inequality is useful for functions on L (𝑉 ,𝑊 ) whose ‘generalised influences’ are small, in an appropriate sense. It leads to a significant shortening of the proof of a recent seminal result by Khot, Minzer and Safra that pseudorandom sets in Grassmann graphs have near-perfect expansion, which (in combination with the work of Dinur, Khot, Kindler, Minzer and Safra) implies the 2-2 Games conjecture (the variant, that is, with imperfect completeness)  

 Noise Stability on the Boolean Hypercube via a Renormalized Brownian Motion   
 Ronen Eldan 
  Dan Mikulincer 
  Prasad Raghavendra 
  We consider a variant of the classical notion of noise on the Boolean hypercube which gives rise to a new approach to inequalities regarding noise stability. We use this approach to give a new proof of the Majority is Stablest theorem by Mossel, O'Donnell, and Oleszkiewicz, improving the dependence of the bound on the maximal influence of the function from logarithmic to polynomial. We also show that a variant of the conjecture by Courtade and Kumar regarding the most informative Boolean function, where the classical noise is replaced by our notion, holds true. Our approach is based on a stochastic construction that we call the renormalized Brownian motion, which facilitates the use of inequalities in Gaussian space in the analysis of Boolean functions.

 A Constant Factor Prophet Inequality for Online Combinatorial Auctions   
 José Correa 
  Andrés Cristi 
  In online combinatorial auctions m  indivisible items are to be allocated to n  agents who arrive online. Agents have random valuations for the different subsets of items and the goal is to allocate the items on the fly so as to maximize the total value of the assignment. A prophet inequality in this setting refers to the existence of an online algorithm guaranteed to obtain, in expectation, a certain fraction of the expected value obtained by an optimal solution in hindsight. The study of prophet inequalities for online combinatorial auctions has been an intensive area of research in recent years, and constant factor prophet inequalities are known when the agents’ valuation functions are submodular or fractionally subadditive. Despite many efforts, for the more general case of subadditive valuations, the best known prophet inequality has an approximation guarantee of O  (loglog m  ). In this paper, we prove the existence of a constant factor prophet inequality for the subadditive case, resolving a central open problem in the area.  
 Our prophet inequality is achieved by a novel, but elementary, sampling idea which we call the Mirror Lemma  . This lemma is essentially concerned with understanding online algorithms for which the set of items that are allocated and those that are not, distribute equally. The other main ingredient is a nonstandard application of Kakutani’s fixed point theorem. Finally, we note that our prophet inequality works against an almighty adversary and even can be implemented in an incentive compatible way.  

 Complexity of Equilibria in First-Price Auctions under General Tie-Breaking Rules   
 Xi Chen 
  Binghui Peng 
  We study the complexity of finding an approximate (pure) Bayesian Nash equilibrium in a first-price auction with common priors when the tie-breaking rule is part of the input. We show that the problem is PPAD-complete even when the tie-breaking rule is trilateral (i.e., it specifies item allocations when no more than three bidders are in tie, and adopts the uniform tie-breaking rule otherwise). This is the first hardness result for equilibrium computation in first-price auctions with common priors. On the positive side, we give a PTAS for the problem under the uniform tie-breaking rule.  

 Computing Better Approximate Pure Nash Equilibria in Cut Games via Semidefinite Programming   
 Ioannis Caragiannis 
  Zhile Jiang 
  Cut games are among the most fundamental strategic games in algorithmic game theory. It is well-known that computing an exact pure Nash equilibrium in these games is PLS-hard, so research has focused on computing approximate equilibria. We present a polynomial-time algorithm that computes 2.7371-approximate pure Nash equilibria in cut games. This is the first improvement to the previously best-known bound of 3, due to the work of Bhalgat, Chakraborty, and Khanna from EC 2010. Our algorithm is based on a general recipe proposed by Caragiannis, Fanelli, Gravin, and Skopalik from FOCS 2011 and applied on several potential games since then. The first novelty of our work is the introduction of a phase that can identify subsets of players who can simultaneously improve their utilities considerably. This is done via semidefinite programming and randomized rounding. In particular, a negative objective value to the semidefinite program guarantees that no such considerable improvement is possible for a given set of players. Otherwise, randomized rounding of the SDP solution is used to identify a set of players who can simultaneously improve their strategies considerably and allows the algorithm to make progress. The way rounding is performed is another important novelty of our work. Here, we exploit an idea that dates back to a paper by Feige and Goemans from 1995, but we take it to an extreme that has not been analyzed before.  

 Credible Decentralized Exchange Design via Verifiable Sequencing Rules   
 Matheus Venturyne Xavier Ferreira 
  David C. Parkes 
  Trading on decentralized exchanges has been one of the primary use cases for permissionless blockchains with daily trading volume exceeding billions of U.S. ‍dollars. In the status quo, users broadcast transactions they wish to execute in the exchange and miners are responsible for composing a block of transactions and picking an execution ordering — the order in which transactions execute in the exchange. Due to the lack of a regulatory framework, it is common to observe miners exploiting their privileged position by front-running transactions and obtaining risk-fee profits. Indeed, the Flashbots service institutionalizes this exploit, with miners auctioning the right to front-run transactions. In this work, we propose to modify the interaction between miners and users and initiate the study of verifiable sequencing rules  . As in the status quo, miners can determine the content of a block; however, they commit to respecting a sequencing rule that constrains the execution ordering and is verifiable (there is a polynomial time algorithm that can verify if the execution ordering satisfies such constraints). Thus in the event a miner deviates from the sequencing rule, anyone can generate a proof of non-compliance.  
 We ask if there are sequencing rules that limit price manipulation from miners in a two-token liquidity pool exchange. Our first result is an impossibility theorem: for any sequencing rule, there is an instance of user transactions where the miner can obtain non-zero risk-free profits. In light of this impossibility result, our main result is a verifiable sequencing rule that provides execution price guarantees for users. In particular, for any user transaction A  , it ensures that either (1) the execution price of A  is at least as good as if A  was the only transaction in the block, or (2) the execution price of A  is worse than this “standalone” price and the miner does not gain when including A  in the block. Our framework does not require users to use countermeasures against predatory trading strategies, for example, set limit prices or split large transactions into smaller ones. This is likely to improve user experience relative to the status quo.  

 On the Optimal Fixed-Price Mechanism in Bilateral Trade   
 Yang Cai 
  Jinzhao Wu 
  We study the problem of social welfare maximization in bilateral trade, where two agents, a buyer and a seller, trade an indivisible item. The seminal result of Myerson and Satterthwaite shows that no incentive compatible and budget balanced  (i.e., the mechanism does not run a deficit) mechanism can achieve the optimal social welfare in bilateral trade. Motivated by this impossibility result, we focus on approximating the optimal social welfare. We consider arguably the simplest form of mechanisms – the fixed-price mechanisms, where the designer offers trade at a fixed price to the seller and buyer. Besides the simple form, fixed-price mechanisms are also the only dominant strategy incentive compatible  and budget balanced  mechanisms in bilateral trade.  
 We obtain improved approximation ratios of fixed-price mechanisms in both (i) the setting where the designer has the full prior information  , that is, the value distributions of both the seller and buyer; and (ii) the setting where the designer only has access to limited information of the prior. In the full prior information setting, we show that the optimal fixed-price mechanism can achieve at least 0.72 of the optimal welfare, and no fixed-price mechanism can achieve more than 0.7381 of the optimal welfare. Prior to our result the state of the art approximation ratio was 1 − 1/ e  + 0.0001≈ 0.632. Interestingly, we further show that the optimal approximation ratio achievable with full prior information is identical  to the optimal approximation ratio obtainable with only one-sided prior information  , i.e., the buyer’s or the seller’s value distribution. As a simple corollary, our upper and lower bounds in the full prior information setting also apply to the case when the designer only has access to one-sided prior information.  
 We further consider two limited information settings. In the first one, the designer is only given the mean of the buyer’s value (or the mean of the seller’s value). We show that with such minimal information, one can already design a fixed-price mechanism that achieves 2/3 of the optimal social welfare, which surpasses the previous state of the art ratio even when the designer has access to the full prior information. In the second limited information setting, we assume that the designer has access to finitely many samples from the value distributions.  
 Recent results show that one can already obtain a constant factor approximation to the optimal welfare using a single sample from the seller’s distribution. Our goal is to understand what approximation ratios are possible if the designer has more than one but still finitely many samples. This is usually a technically more challenging regime and requires tools different from the single-sample analysis. We propose a new family of sample-based fixed-price mechanisms that we refer to as the order statistic mechanisms  and provide a complete characterization of their approximation ratios for any fixed number of samples. Using the characterization, we provide the optimal approximation ratios obtainable by order statistic mechanism for small sample sizes (no more than 10 samples) and observe that they significantly outperform the single sample mechanism.  

 Improved Approximation Ratios of Fixed-Price Mechanisms in Bilateral Trades   
 Zhengyang Liu 
  Zeyu Ren 
  Zihe Wang 
  We continue the study of the performance for fixed-price mechanisms in the bilateral trade problem, and improve approximation ratios of welfare-optimal mechanisms in several settings. Specifically, in the case where only the buyer distribution is known, we prove that there exists a distribution over different fixed-price mechanisms, such that the approximation ratio lies within the interval of [0.71, 0.7381]. Furthermore, we show that the same approximation ratio holds for the optimal fixed-price mechanism, when both buyer and seller distributions are known. As a result, the previously best-known (1 − 1/ e  +0.0001)-approximation can be improved to 0.71. Additionally, we examine randomized fixed-price mechanisms when we receive just one single sample from the seller distribution, for both symmetric and asymmetric settings. Our findings reveal that posting the single sample as the price remains optimal among all randomized fixed-price mechanisms.

 Improved and Deterministic Online Service with Deadlines or Delay   
 Noam Touitou 
  We consider the problem of online service with delay on a general metric space, first presented by Azar, Ganesh, Ge and Panigrahi (STOC 2017). The best known randomized algorithm for this problem, by Azar and Touitou (FOCS 2019), is O  (log 2  n  )-competitive, where n  is the number of points in the metric space. This is also the best known result for the special case of online service with deadlines, which is of independent interest.  
 In this paper, we present O  (log n  )-competitive deterministic algorithms for online service with deadlines or delay, improving upon the results from FOCS 2019. Furthermore, our algorithms are the first deterministic algorithms for online service with deadlines or delay which apply to general metric spaces and have sub-polynomial competitiveness.  

 Online Unrelated-Machine Load Balancing and Generalized Flow with Recourse   
 Ravishankar Krishnaswamy 
  Shi Li 
  Varun Suriyanarayana 
  We consider the recourse version of the classical online load balancing problem on unrelated machines, where the algorithm is allowed to re-assign prior jobs. We give a (2+є)-competitive algorithm for the problem with O  є  (log n  ) amortized recourse per job. This is the first O  (1)-competitive algorithm for the problem with non-trivial recourse, and the competitive ratio nearly matches the long-standing best-known offline approximation guarantee. We also show an O  (loglog n  /logloglog n  )-competitive algorithm for the problem with O  (1) amortized recourse. The best-known bounds from prior work are O  (loglog n  )-competitive algorithms with O  (1) amortized recourse due to Gupta et al., for the special case of the restricted assignment model.  
 Along the way, we design an algorithm for the recourse version of the online generalized network flow problem (also known as network flow problem with gains). We have a graph with costs and capacities on the edges, and sources arrive online. Upon arrival of a source, we need to send unit flow from the source. In contrast to standard network flow, every edge uv  in the network has a gain parameter  γ uv   > 0, meaning that θ-units of flow sent from u  across uv  becomes γ uv   θ units of flow when it reaches v  . In the recourse version, the algorithm can undo prior flow sent on an edge by incurring a linear cost. We present an online algorithm for the problem with recourse at most O  (1/є) times the offline optimum cost flow for the instance when edge capacities are scaled by a factor 1/1+є. This marks an improvement over prior work in two ways: the known algorithms only apply to standard network flow (i.e., unit gains), and secondly, the guarantees held against an offline flow when edge capacities are scaled by a factor of (2+є). As an immediate corollary of this, we also obtain an improved algorithm for the online b  -matching problem with reassignment costs.  

 Pandora Box Problem with Nonobligatory Inspection: Hardness and Approximation Scheme   
 Hu Fu 
  Jiawei Li 
  Daogao Liu 
  Weitzman (1979) introduced the Pandora Box problem as a model for sequential search with inspection costs, and gave an elegant index-based policy that attains provably optimal expected payoff. In various scenarios, the searching agent may select an option without making a costly inspection. The variant of the Pandora box problem with non-obligatory inspection has attracted interest from both economics and algorithms researchers. Various simple algorithms have proved suboptimal, with the best known 0.8-approximation algorithm due to Guha et al. (2008). No hardness result for the problem was known.  
 In this work, we show that it is NP-hard to compute an optimal policy for Pandora’s problem with nonobligatory inspection. We also give a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) that computes policies with an expected payoff at least (1 − є)-fraction of the optimal, for arbitrarily small є > 0. On the side, we show the decision version of the problem to be in NP.  

 Pandora’s Problem with Nonobligatory Inspection: Optimal Structure and a PTAS   
 Hedyeh Beyhaghi 
  Linda Cai 
  Weitzman (1979) introduced Pandora’s box problem as a mathematical model of sequential search with inspection costs, in which a searcher is allowed to select a prize from one of n  alternatives. Several decades later, Doval (2018) introduced a close version of the problem, where the searcher does not need to incur the inspection cost of an alternative, and can select it uninspected. Unlike the original problem, the optimal solution to the nonobligatory inspection variant is proved to need adaptivity by Doval (2018), and by recent work of Fu Li and Liu (2022), finding the optimal solution is NP-hard.  
 Our first main result is a structural characterization of the optimal policy: We show there exists an optimal policy that follows only two different pre-determined orders of inspection, and transitions from one to the other at most once. Our second main result is a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS). Our proof involves a novel reduction to a framework developed by Fu Li and Xu (2018), utilizing our optimal two-phase structure. Furthermore, we show Pandora’s problem with nonobligatory inspection belongs to class NP, which by using the hardness result of Fu Li and Liu (2022), settles the computational complexity class of the problem. Finally, we provide a tight 0.8 approximation and a novel proof for committing policies  (informally, the set of nonadaptive policies) for general classes of distributions, which was previously shown only for discrete and finite distributions in Guha, Munagala and Sarka (2008).  

 Local and Global Expansion in Random Geometric Graphs   
 Siqi Liu 
  Sidhanth Mohanty 
  Tselil Schramm 
  Elizabeth Yang 
  Consider a random geometric 2-dimensional simplicial complex X  sampled as follows: first, sample n  vectors u  1  ,…, u  n   uniformly at random on S d  −1  ; then, for each triple i  , j  , k  ∈ [ n  ], add { i  , j  , k  } and all of its subsets to X  if and only if ⟨ u  i   , u  j   ⟩ ≥ τ, ⟨ u  i   , u  k   ⟩ ≥ τ, and ⟨ u  j   , u  k   ⟩ ≥ τ. We prove that for every ε > 0, there exists a choice of d  = Θ(log n  ) and τ = τ(ε, d  ) so that with high probability, X  is a high-dimensional expander of average degree n  ε  in which each 1-link has spectral gap bounded away from 1/2.  
 To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a natural distribution over 2-dimensional expanders of arbitrarily small polynomial average degree and spectral link expansion better than 1/2. All previously known constructions are algebraic. This distribution also furnishes an example of simplicial complexes for which the trickle-down theorem is nearly tight.  
 En route, we prove general bounds on the spectral expansion of random induced subgraphs of arbitrary vertex transitive graphs, which may be of independent interest. For example, one consequence is an almost-sharp bound on the second eigenvalue of random n  -vertex geometric graphs on S d  −1  , which was previously unknown for most n  , d  pairs.  
 The full version of this paper can be found here.  

 New High Dimensional Expanders from Covers   
 Yotam Dikstein 
  We present a new construction of high dimensional expanders based on covering spaces of simplicial complexes. High dimensional expanders (HDXs) are hypergraph analogues of expander graphs. They have many uses in theoretical computer science, but unfortunately only few constructions are known which have arbitrarily small local spectral expansion.  
 We give a randomized algorithm that takes as input a high dimensional expander X  (satisfying some mild assumptions). It outputs a sub-complex Y  ⊆ X  that is a high dimensional expander and has infinitely many simplicial covers. These covers form new families of bounded-degree high dimensional expanders. The sub-complex Y  inherits X  ’s underlying graph and its links are sparsifications of the links of X  . When the size of the links of X  is O  (log| X  |), this algorithm can be made deterministic.  
 Our algorithm is based on the groups and generating sets discovered by Lubotzky, Samuels and Vishne (2005), that were used to construct the first discovered high dimensional expanders. We show these groups give rise to many more “randomized” high dimensional expanders.  
 In addition, our techniques also give a random sparsification algorithm for high dimensional expanders, that maintains its local spectral properties. This may be of independent interest.  

 Towards the Erdős-Gallai Cycle Decomposition Conjecture   
 Matija Bucić 
  Richard Montgomery 
  In the 1960’s, Erdős and Gallai conjectured that the edges of any n  -vertex graph can be decomposed into O  ( n  ) cycles and edges. We improve upon the previous best bound of O  ( n  loglog n  ) cycles and edges due to Conlon, Fox and Sudakov, by showing an n  -vertex graph can always be decomposed into O  ( n  log ⋆  n  ) cycles and edges, where log ⋆  n  is the iterated logarithm function. Our arguments make use and further develop the theory of robust sublinear expander graphs.

 An Optimal “It Ain’t Over Till It’s Over” Theorem   
 Ronen Eldan 
  Avi Wigderson 
  Pei Wu 
  We study the probability of Boolean functions with small max influence to become constant under random restrictions. Let f  be a Boolean function such that the variance of f  is Ω(1) and all its individual influences are bounded by τ. We show that when restricting all but a ρ=Ω((log1/τ) −1  ) fraction of the coordinates, the restricted function remains nonconstant with overwhelming probability. This bound is essentially optimal, as witnessed by the tribes function = n  / C  log n   ∘ C  log n   .  
 We extend it to an anti-concentration result, showing that the restricted function has nontrivial variance with probability 1− o  (1). This gives a sharp version of the “it ain’t over till it’s over” theorem due to Mossel, O’Donnell, and Oleszkiewicz. Our proof is discrete, and avoids the use of the invariance principle.  
 We also show two consequences of our above result: (i) As a corollary, we prove that for a uniformly random input x  , the block sensitivity of f  at x  is Ω(log1/τ) with probability 1− o  (1). This should be compared with the implication of Kahn, Kalai and Linial’s result, which implies that the average block sensitivity of f  is Ω(log1/τ). (ii) Combining our proof with a well-known result due to O’Donnell, Saks, Schramm and Servedio, one can also conclude that: Restricting all but a ρ=Ω(1/√log(1/τ) ) fraction of the coordinates of a monotone function f  , then the restricted function has decision tree complexity Ω(τ −Θ(ρ)  ) with probability Ω(1).  

 Randomized versus Deterministic Decision Tree Size   
 Arkadev Chattopadhyay 
  Yogesh Dahiya 
  Nikhil S. Mande 
  Jaikumar Radhakrishnan 
  Swagato Sanyal 
  A classic result of Nisan [SICOMP ’91] states that the deterministic decision tree *depth* complexity of every total Boolean function is at most the cube of its randomized decision tree *depth* complexity. The question whether randomness helps in significantly reducing the *size* of decision trees appears not to have been addressed. We show that the logarithm of the deterministic decision tree size complexity of every total Boolean function on n  input variables is at most the fourth power of the logarithm of its bounded-error randomized decision tree size complexity, ignoring a polylogarithmic factor in the input size.  
 Our result has the following consequences: - The deterministic AND-OR query complexity of a total Boolean function is at most the fourth power of its randomized AND-OR query complexity, ignoring a polylog n factor. - The deterministic AND (OR) query complexity of a total Boolean function is at most the cube of its randomized AND (OR) query complexity, ignoring a polylog n factor. This answers a recent open question posed by Knop, Lovett, McGuire and Yuan [SIGACT News ’21]. - The notion of *rank* of a Boolean function was defined in a classic work of Ehrenfeucht and Haussler [Information and Computation’89] in the context of learning theory, and is characterized by the logarithm of decision tree size up to a logarithmic factor in the input size. Our results confirm a recent conjecture (ignoring a polylog n factor) of Cornelissen, Mande and Patro [FSTTCS ’22], that asserted the equivalence of randomized and deterministic analogs of rank, upto polynomial factors, for all total Boolean functions. - Combined with the above-mentioned work of Ehrenfeucht and Haussler, our result implies that the class of functions computable by randomized decision trees of polynomial size, is PAC-learnable in quasi-polynomial time.  
 To obtain our main result on decision tree size, we use as an intermediate measure the *block number* of a Boolean function, studied first by Kulkarni and Tal [CJTCS’16], which can be thought of as a counting analog of *block sensitivity* of a Boolean function that played a central role in Nisan’s result mentioned above.  

 Optimal Explicit Small-Depth Formulas for the Coin Problem   
 Srikanth Srinivasan 
  Utkarsh Tripathi 
  The δ -Coin Problem  is the problem of distinguishing between a sequence of coin tosses that come up Heads with probability either 1+δ/2 or 1−δ/2. The computational complexity of this problem in various models has been studied in many previous works with various applications related to derandomization, hierarchy theorems, cryptography and meta-complexity.  
 In this paper, we construct improved small-depth explicit formulas for the coin problem. Specifically, we construct explicit formulas of optimal size exp( O  ( d  (1/δ) d  −1  )) and  information-theoretically optimal sample complexity O  (1/δ 2  ) (the sample complexity is the number of coin tosses supplied to the formulas) for this problem, as long as 1/δ ≥ d  C  · d   for a large enough absolute constant C  . Previous constructions of size-optimal AC  0  formulas for the coin problem were either randomized (and hence non-explicit) or had a much worse sample complexity of (1/δ) Ω( d  )  .  
 Our improved construction yields better Fixed-Depth Size Hierarchy theorems for uniform classes of small-depth circuits with AND, OR and ⊕ gates.  
 Our techniques deviate considerably from previous explicit constructions with non-trivial sample complexity due to Limaye, Sreenivasaiah, Venkitesh and the two authors (SICOMP 2021). While the approach there was to derandomize randomized formula constructions based on results of O’Donnell and Wimmer (ICALP 2007) and Amano (ICALP 2009), we instead look to derandomize a randomized circuit construction due to Rossman and Srinivasan (Theory of Computing 2019). This leads us to the problem of constructing certain pseudorandom graphs, which we do explicitly using ideas of Viola (Computational Complexity 2014) involving an iterative use of expander graphs. The constructions of these graphs, which are related to dispersers, may be independently interesting.  

 Depth-𝑑 Threshold Circuits vs. Depth-(𝑑+1) AND-OR Trees   
 Pooya Hatami 
  William M. Hoza 
  Avishay Tal 
  Roei Tell 
  For any n  ∈ ℕ and d  = o  (loglog( n  )), we prove that there is a Boolean function F  on n  bits and a value γ = 2 −Θ( d  )  such that F  can be computed by a uniform depth-( d  + 1) AC  0  circuit with O  ( n  ) wires, but F  cannot be computed by any depth- d  TC  0  circuit with n  1 + γ  wires. This bound matches the current state-of-the-art lower bounds for computing explicit functions by threshold circuits of depth d  > 2, which were previously known only for functions outside AC  0  such as the parity function. Furthermore, in our result, the AC  0  circuit computing F  is a monotone *read-once formula* (i.e., an AND-OR tree), and the lower bound holds even in the average-case setting with respect to advantage n  −γ  .  
 At a high level, our proof strategy combines two prominent approaches in circuit complexity from the last decade: The celebrated *random projections* method of Håstad, Rossman, Servedio, and Tan (J. ACM 2017), which was previously used to show a tight average-case depth hierarchy for AC  0  ; and the line of works analyzing the effect of *random restrictions* on threshold circuits. We show that under a modified version of Håstad, Rossman, Servedio, and Tan’s projection procedure, any depth- d  threshold circuit with n  1 + γ  wires simplifies to a near-trivial function, whereas an appropriately parameterized AND-OR tree of depth d  + 1 maintains structure.

 Good Quantum LDPC Codes with Linear Time Decoders

  We construct a new explicit family of good quantum low-density parity-check codes which additionally have linear time decoders. Our codes are based on a three-term chain (2 m  × m   ) V   → δ 0   (2 m   ) E   → δ 1   2 F   where V  ( X  -checks) are the vertices, E  (qubits) are the edges, and F  ( Z  -checks) are the squares of a left-right Cayley complex, and where the maps are defined based on a pair of constant-size random codes C  A   , C  B   :2 m   →2 Δ  where Δ is the regularity of the underlying Cayley graphs.  
 One of the main ingredients in the analysis is a proof of an essentially-optimal robustness property for the tensor product of two random codes.  

 An Efficient Decoder for a Linear Distance Quantum LDPC Code   
 Shouzhen Gu 
  Christopher A. Pattison 
  Eugene Tang 
  Recent developments have shown the existence of quantum low-density parity check (qLDPC) codes with constant rate and linear distance. A natural question concerns the efficient decodability of these codes. In this paper, we present a linear time decoder for the recent quantum Tanner codes construction of asymptotically good qLDPC codes, which can correct all errors of weight up to a constant fraction of the blocklength. Our decoder is an iterative algorithm which searches for corrections within constant-sized regions. At each step, the corrections are found by reducing a locally defined and efficiently computable cost function which serves as a proxy for the weight of the remaining error.  

 Certified Randomness from Quantum Supremacy   
 Scott Aaronson 
  Shih-Han Hung 
  We propose an application for near-term quantum devices: namely, generating cryptographically certified random bits, to use (for example) in proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies. Our protocol repurposes the existing “quantum supremacy” experiments, based on random circuit sampling, that Google and USTC have successfully carried out starting in 2019. We show that, whenever the outputs of these experiments pass the now-standard Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark (LXEB), under plausible hardness assumptions they necessarily contain Ω( n  ) min-entropy, where n  is the number of qubits. To achieve a net gain in randomness, we use a small random seed to produce pseudorandom challenge circuits. In response to the challenge circuits, the quantum computer generates output strings that, after verification, can then be fed into a randomness extractor to produce certified nearly-uniform bits—thereby “bootstrapping” from pseudorandomness to genuine randomness. We prove our protocol sound in two senses: (i) under a hardness assumption called Long List Quantum Supremacy Verification, which we justify in the random oracle model, and (ii) unconditionally in the random oracle model against an eavesdropper who could share arbitrary entanglement with the device. (Note that our protocol’s output is unpredictable even to a computationally unbounded adversary who can see the random oracle.) Currently, the central drawback of our protocol is the exponential cost of verification, which in practice will limit its implementation to at most n  ∼ 60 qubits, a regime where attacks are expensive but not impossible. Modulo that drawback, our protocol appears to be the only practical application of quantum computing that both requires a QC and is physically realizable today.

  We give a polynomial time classical algorithm for sampling from the output distribution of a noisy random quantum circuit in the regime of anti-concentration to within inverse polynomial total variation distance.

  We prove that 1− o  (1) fraction of all k  -SAT functions on n  Boolean variables are unate (i.e., monotone after first negating some variables), for any fixed positive integer k  and as n  → ∞. This resolves a conjecture by Bollobás, Brightwell, and Leader from 2003.  
 This paper is the second half of a two-part work solving the problem. The first part, by Dong, Mani, and Zhao, reduces the conjecture to a Turán problem on partially directed hypergraphs. In this paper we solve this Turán problem.

  For integers ‍ k  ≥ 1 and n  ≥ 2 k  +1, the Kneser graph ‍ K  ( n  , k  ) has as vertices all k  -element subsets of an n  -element ground set, and an edge between any two disjoint sets. It has been conjectured since the 1970s that all Kneser graphs admit a Hamilton cycle, with one notable exception, namely the Petersen graph ‍ K  (5,2). This problem received considerable attention in the literature, including a recent solution for the sparsest case n  =2 k  +1. The main contribution of this paper is to prove the conjecture in full generality. We also extend this Hamiltonicity result to all connected generalized Johnson graphs (except the Petersen graph). The generalized Johnson graph ‍ J  ( n  , k  , s  ) has as vertices all k  -element subsets of an n  -element ground set, and an edge between any two sets whose intersection has size exactly ‍ s  . Clearly, we have K  ( n  , k  )= J  ( n  , k  ,0), i.e., generalized Johnson graph include Kneser graphs as a special case. Our results imply that all known families of vertex-transitive graphs defined by intersecting set systems have a Hamilton cycle, which settles an interesting special case of Lovász’ conjecture on Hamilton cycles in vertex-transitive graphs from ‍1970. Our main technical innovation is to study cycles in Kneser graphs by a kinetic system of multiple gliders that move at different speeds and that interact over time, reminiscent of the gliders in Conway’s Game of Life, and to analyze this system combinatorially and via linear algebra.  

 Random Walks on Rotating Expanders   
 Gil Cohen 
  Gal Maor 
  Random walks on expanders are a powerful tool which found applications in many areas of theoretical computer science, and beyond. However, they come with an inherent cost – the spectral expansion of the corresponding power graph deteriorates at a rate that is exponential in the length of the walk. As an example, when G  is a d  -regular Ramanujan graph, the power graph G  t   has spectral expansion 2 Ω( t  )  √ D  , where D  = d  t   is the regularity of G  t   , thus, G  t   is 2 Ω( t  )  away from being Ramanujan. This exponential blowup manifests itself in many applications.  
 In this work we bypass this barrier by permuting the vertices of the given graph after each random step. We prove that there exists a sequence of permutations for which the spectral expansion deteriorates by only a linear  factor in t  . In the Ramanujan case this yields an expansion of O  ( t  √ D  ). We stress that the permutations are tailor-made to the graph at hand and require no randomness to generate.  
 Our proof, which holds for all sufficiently high girth graphs, makes heavy use of the powerful framework of finite free probability and interlacing families that was developed in a seminal sequence of works by Marcus, Spielman and Srivastava.  

 Algorithmic Applications of Hypergraph and Partition Containers   
 Or Zamir 
  We present a general method to convert algorithms into faster algorithms for almost-regular input instances. Informally, an almost-regular input is an input in which the maximum degree is larger than the average degree by at most a constant factor. This family of inputs vastly generalizes several families of inputs for which we commonly have improved algorithms, including bounded-degree inputs and random inputs. It also generalizes families of inputs for which we don’t usually have faster algorithms, including regular-inputs of arbitrarily high degree and very dense inputs. We apply our method to achieve breakthroughs in exact algorithms for several central NP-Complete problems including k  -SAT, Graph Coloring, and Maximum Independent Set.  
 Our main tool is the first algorithmic application of the relatively new Hypergraph Container Method (Saxton and Thomason 2015, Balogh, Morris and Samotij 2015). This recent breakthrough, which generalizes an earlier version for graphs (Kleitman and Winston 1982, Sapozhenko 2001), has been used extensively in recent years in extremal combinatorics. An important component of our work is the generalization of (hyper-)graph containers to Partition Containers.

 Subsampling Suffices for Adaptive Data Analysis   
 Guy Blanc 
  Ensuring that analyses performed on a dataset are representative of the entire population is one of the central problems in statistics. Most classical techniques assume that the dataset is independent of the analyst’s query and break down in the common setting where a dataset is reused for multiple, adaptively chosen, queries. This problem of adaptive data analysis  was formalized in the seminal works of Dwork et al. (STOC, 2015) and Hardt and Ullman (FOCS, 2014).  
 We identify a remarkably simple set of assumptions under which the queries will continue to be representative even when chosen adaptively: The only requirements are that each query takes as input a random subsample and outputs few bits. This result shows that the noise inherent in subsampling is sufficient to guarantee that query responses generalize. The simplicity of this subsampling-based framework allows it to model a variety of real-world scenarios not covered by prior work.  
 In addition to its simplicity, we demonstrate the utility of this framework by designing mechanisms for two foundational tasks, statistical queries and median finding. In particular, our mechanism for answering the broadly applicable class of statistical queries is both extremely simple and state of the art in many parameter regimes.  

 The Power of Multi-step Vizing Chains   
 Aleksander Bjørn Grodt Christiansen 
  Recent papers have addressed different variants of the (Δ + 1)-edge-colouring problem by concatenating or gluing together many Vizing chains to form what Bernshteyn coined multi-step Vizing chains  . In this paper, we consider the most general definition of this term and apply different multi-step Vizing chain constructions to prove combinatorial properties of edge-colourings that lead to (improved) algorithms for computing edge-colouring across different models of computation. This approach seems especially powerful for constructing augmenting subgraphs which respect some notion of locality.  
 First, we construct strictly local multi-step Vizing chains and use them to show a local version of Vizing’s Theorem thus confirming a recent conjecture of Bonamy, Delcourt, Lang and Postle. That is, we show that there exists a proper edge-colouring of a graph such that every edge uv  receives a colour from the list {1,2, …, max{ d  ( u  ), d  ( v  )}+1}. Our proof is constructive and also implies an O  ( n  2  Δ) time algorithm for computing such a colouring.  
 Then, we show that for any uncoloured edge there exists an augmenting subgraph of size O  (Δ 7  log n  ), answering an open problem of Bernshteyn. Chang, He, Li, Pettie and Uitto show a lower bound of Ω(Δ log n  /Δ) for the size of augmenting subgraphs, so the upper bound is asymptotically tight up to Δ factors. These ideas also extend to give a faster deterministic LOCAL algorithm for (Δ + 1)-edge-colouring running in Õ((Δ)log 6  n  ) rounds. These results improve the dependency on log n  compared to the recent breakthrough result of Bernshteyn, who showed the existence of augmenting subgraphs of size O  (Δ 6  log 2  n  ), and used these to give the first (Δ + 1)-edge-colouring algorithm in the LOCAL model running in O  ((Δ, log n  )) rounds.  
 Finally for dynamic graphs, we show how to maintain a(1+ε)Δ-edge-colouring fully adaptive to Δ in O  (ε −6  log 9  n  log 6  Δ) worst-case update time w.h.p without any restrictions on Δ. This should be compared to the edge-colouring algorithm of Duan, He and Zhang that runs in O  (ε −4  log 8  n  ) amortised update time w.h.p under the condition that Δ = Ω(ε −2  log 2  n  ). Our algorithm avoids the use of O  (ε −1  log n  ) copies of the graph, resulting in a smaller space consumption and an algorithm with provably low recourse.

 Capturing One-Way Functions via NP-Hardness of Meta-Complexity   
 Shuichi Hirahara 
  A one-way function is a function that is easy to compute but hard to invert *on average*. We establish the first characterization of a one-way function by *worst-case* hardness assumptions, by introducing a natural meta-computational problem whose NP-hardness (and the worst-case hardness of NP) characterizes the existence of a one-way function. Specifically, we generalize the notion of time-bounded conditional Kolmogorov complexity to *distributional Kolmogorov complexity*, and prove that a one-way function exists if and only if it is NP-hard to approximate the distributional Kolmogorov complexity under randomized polynomial-time reductions and NP is hard in the worst case. We also propose the *Meta-Complexity Padding Conjecture*, which postulates that distributional Kolmogorov complexity is paddable by an approximation-preserving reduction. Under this conjecture, we prove that the worst-case hardness of an approximate version of the Minimum Circuit Size Problem characterizes the existence of a one-way function.  
 Our results extend the emerging paradigm of meta-complexity, which suggests that proving NP-hardness of meta-computational problems (i.e., problems that ask to compute complexity) is sufficient to exclude errorless Heuristica and error-prone Pessiland from Impagliazzo's five worlds. The key technical contribution is to conditionally close the gap between errorless and error-prone average-case complexities by combining Nanashima's proof techniques of showing "limits" of black-box reductions (ITCS'21) with non-black-box worst-case-to-average-case reductions of Hirahara (FOCS'18).  

 A Duality between One-Way Functions and Average-Case Symmetry of Information   
 Shuichi Hirahara 
  Rahul Ilango 
  Zhenjian Lu 
  Mikito Nanashima 
  Igor C. Oliveira 
  Symmetry of Information (SoI) is a fundamental property of Kolmogorov complexity that relates the complexity of a pair of strings and their conditional complexities. Understanding if this property holds in the time-bounded  setting is a longstanding open problem. In the nineties, Longpré and Mocas (1993) and Longpré and Watanabe (1995) established that if SoI holds for time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity then cryptographic one-way functions do not exist, and asked if a converse holds.  
 We show that one-way functions exist if and only if  (probabilistic) time-bounded SoI fails on average, i.e., if there is a samplable distribution of pairs ( x  , y  ) of strings such that SoI for pK  t   complexity fails for many of these pairs. Our techniques rely on recent perspectives offered by probabilistic Kolmogorov complexity and meta-complexity, and reveal further equivalences between inverting one-way functions and the validity of key properties of Kolmogorov complexity in the time-bounded setting: (average-case) language compression and (average-case) conditional coding.  
 Motivated by these results, we investigate correspondences of this form for the worst-case hardness of (i.e., ‍ NP  ⊈ BPP  ) and for the average-case hardness of (i.e., DistNP  ⊈ HeurBPP  ), respectively. Our results establish the existence of similar dualities  between these computational assumptions and the failure of results from Kolmogorov complexity in the time-bounded setting. In particular, these characterizations offer a novel way to investigate the main hardness conjectures of complexity theory (and the relationships among them) through the lens of Kolmogorov complexity and its properties.  

 Unprovability of Strong Complexity Lower Bounds in Bounded Arithmetic   
 Jiatu Li 
  Igor C. Oliveira 
  While there has been progress in establishing the unprovability of complexity statements in lower fragments of bounded arithmetic, understanding the limits of Jerabek’s theory APC  1  (2007) and of higher levels of Buss’s hierarchy S  2  i   (1986) has been a more elusive task. Even in the more restricted setting of Cook’s theory PV  (1975), known results often rely on a less natural formalization that encodes a complexity statement using a collection of sentences instead of a single sentence. This is done to reduce the quantifier complexity of the resulting sentences so that standard witnessing results can be invoked.  
 In this work, we establish unprovability results for stronger theories and for sentences of higher quantifier complexity. In particular, we unconditionally show that APC  1  cannot prove strong complexity lower bounds separating the third level of the polynomial hierarchy. In more detail, we consider non-uniform average-case separations, and establish that APC  1  cannot prove a sentence stating that  
 * ∀ n  ≥ n  0  ∃ f  n   ∈ Π 3  -SIZE[ n  d   ] that is (1/ n  )-far from every Σ 3  -SIZE[2 n  δ   ] circuit.  
 This is a consequence of a much more general result showing that, for every i  ≥ 1, strong separations for Π i   -SIZE[ poly  ( n  )] versus Σ i   -SIZE[2 n  Ω(1)   ] cannot be proved in the theory T  PV   i   consisting of all true ∀ Σ i  −1  b   -sentences in the language of Cook’s theory PV  .  
 Our argument employs a convenient game-theoretic witnessing result that can be applied to sentences of arbitrary quantifier complexity. We combine it with extensions of a technique introduced by Krajicek (2011) that was recently employed by Pich and Santhanam (2021) to establish the unprovability of lower bounds in PV  (i.e., the case i  =1 above, but under a weaker formalization) and in a fragment of APC  1  .  

 Range Avoidance, Remote Point, and Hard Partial Truth Table via Satisfying-Pairs Algorithms   
 Yeyuan Chen 
  Yizhi Huang 
  Jiatu Li 
  Hanlin Ren 
  The range avoidance problem, denoted as C-Avoid, asks to find a non-output of a given C-circuit C:0,1^n -> 0,1^l with stretch l>n. This problem has recently received much attention in complexity theory for its connections with circuit lower bounds and other explicit construction problems. Inspired by the Algorithmic Method for circuit lower bounds, Ren, Santhanam, and Wang (FOCS’22) established a framework to design FP^NP algorithms for C-Avoid via slightly non-trivial data structures related to C. However, a major drawback of their approach is the lack of unconditional results even for C=AC^0.  
 In this work, we present the first unconditional FP^NP algorithm for ACC^0-Avoid. Indeed, we obtain FP^NP algorithms for the following stronger problems:  
 (ACC^0-RemotePoint). Given C:0,1^n -> 0,1^l for some l=quasipoly(n) such that each output bit of C is computed by a quasipoly(n)-size AC^0[m] circuit, we can find some y ∈0,1^l in FP^NP such that for every x ∈0, 1^n, the relative Hamming distance between y and C(x) is at least 1/2-1/poly(n). This problem is the ”average-case” analogue of ACC^0-Avoid.  
 (ACC^0-AvgPartialHard). Given x_1,…,x_l ∈0,1^n for some l=quasipoly(n), we can compute l bits y_1,…,y_l ∈0,1 in FP^NP such that for every 2^log c  (n)-size ACC^0 circuit C, Pr_i[C(x_i)≠y_i]≥1/2-1/poly(n), where c=O(1). This problem generalises the strong average-case circuit lower bounds against ACC^0 in a different way.  
 Our algorithms can be seen as natural generalisations of the best known almost-everywhere average-case lower bounds against ACC^0 circuits by Chen, Lyu, and Williams (FOCS’20). Note that both problems above have been studied prior to our work, and no FP^NP algorithm was known even for weak circuit classes such as GF(2)-linear circuits and DNF formulas.  
 Our results follow from a strengthened algorithmic method: slightly non-trivial algorithms for the Satisfying-Pairs problem for C implies FP^NP algorithms for C-Avoid (as well as C-RemotePoint and C-AvgPartialHard). Here, given C-circuits C_i and inputs x_j, the C-Satisfying-Pairs problem asks to (approximately) count the number of pairs (i,j) such that C_i(x_j)=1.  
 A technical contribution of this work is a construction of a short, smooth, and rectangular PCP of Proximity that combines two previous PCP constructions, which may be of independent interest. It serves as a key tool that allows us to generalise the framework for Avoid to the average-case scenarios.  

 NP-Hardness of Approximating Meta-Complexity: A Cryptographic Approach   
 Yizhi Huang 
  Rahul Ilango 
  Hanlin Ren 
  It is a long-standing open problem whether the Minimum Circuit Size Problem ( MCSP  ) and related meta-complexity problems are NP  -complete. Even for the rare cases where the NP  -hardness of meta-complexity problems are known, we only know very weak hardness of approximation.  
 In this work, we prove NP  -hardness of approximating meta-complexity with nearly-optimal approximation gaps. Our key idea is to use cryptographic constructions  in our reductions, where the security of the cryptographic construction implies the correctness of the reduction. We present both conditional and unconditional hardness of approximation results as follows.  
 1. Assuming subexponentially-secure witness encryption exists, we prove essentially optimal NP  -hardness of approximating conditional time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity ( K  t   ( x  | y  )) in the regime where t  >> | y  |. Previously, the best hardness of approximation known was a | x  | 1/ (loglog| x  |)  factor and only in the sublinear regime ( t  << | y  |).  
 2. Unconditionally, we show that for any constant c  > 1, the Minimum Oracle Circuit Size Problem ( MOCSP  ) is NP  -hard to approximate, where Yes instances have circuit complexity at most s  , and No instances have circuit complexity at least s  c   . Our reduction builds on a witness encryption construction proposed by Garg, Gentry, Sahai, and Waters (STOC’13). Previously, it was unknown whether it is NP  -hard to distinguish between oracle circuit complexity s  versus 10 s  log N  .  
 3. Finally, we define a “multi-valued” version of MCSP  , called mvMCSP  , and show that w.p. ‍1 over a random oracle O  , it is NP  -hard to approximate mvMCSP  O   under quasi-polynomial-time reductions with an O  oracle. Intriguingly, this result follows almost directly from the security of Micali’s CS Proofs (Micali, SICOMP’00).  
 In conclusion, we give three results convincingly demonstrating the power of cryptographic techniques in proving NP  -hardness of approximating meta-complexity.  

 Indistinguishability Obfuscation, Range Avoidance, and Bounded Arithmetic   
 Rahul Ilango 
  Jiatu Li 
  R. Ryan Williams 
  The range avoidance problem  (denoted by Avoid  ) asks to find a string outside of the range of a given circuit C  :{0,1} n   →{0,1} m   , where m  > n  . Although at least half of the strings of length m  are correct answers, it is not clear how to deterministically  find one. Recent results of Korten (FOCS’21) and Ren, Wang, and Santhanam (FOCS’ 22) show that efficient deterministic algorithms for Avoid  would have far-reaching consequences, including strong circuit lower bounds and explicit constructions of combinatorial objects (e.g., Ramsey graphs, extractors, rigid matrices). This strongly motivates the question: does an efficient deterministic algorithm for Avoid  actually exist?  
 In this work, we prove under the existence of subexponentially secure indistinguishability obfuscation  ( i  O  ) that polynomial-time deterministic algorithms for Avoid  imply NP  = coNP  . Combining this with Jain, Lin, and Sahai’s recent breakthrough construction of i  O  from well-founded assumptions (STOC’21, EUROCRYPT’22), we provide the first plausible evidence that Avoid  has no efficient deterministic algorithm. Moreover, we also prove the hardness of Avoid  based on polynomially-secure i  O  and a weaker variant of the Nondeterministic Exponential Time Hypothesis (NETH).  
 Extending our techniques, we prove a surprising separation in bounded arithmetic  , conditioned on similar assumptions. Assuming subexponentially secure i  O  and coNP  is not infinitely often in , we show that Avoid  has no deterministic polynomial-time algorithm even when we are allowed O  (1) queries to an oracle that can invert the given input circuit on an arbitrarily chosen m  -bit string. It follows that the dual Weak Pigeonhole Principle  , the combinatorial principle underlying Avoid  , is not provable in Cook’s theory PV  1  . This gives (under plausible assumptions) the first separation of Cook’s theory PV  1  for polynomial-time reasoning and Jeřábek’s theory APV  1  for probabilistic polynomial-time reasoning.

 NLTS Hamiltonians from Good Quantum Codes   
 Anurag Anshu 
  Nikolas P. Breuckmann 
  Chinmay Nirkhe 
  The NLTS (No Low-Energy Trivial State) conjecture of Freedman and Hastings posits that there exist families of Hamiltonians with all low energy states of non-trivial complexity (with complexity measured by the quantum circuit depth preparing the state). We prove this conjecture by showing that a particular family of constant-rate and linear-distance qLDPC codes correspond to NLTS local Hamiltonians, although we believe this to be true for all current constructions of good qLDPC codes.  

 Memory-Sample Lower Bounds for Learning with Classical-Quantum Hybrid Memory   
 Qipeng Liu 
  Ran Raz 
  Wei Zhan 
  In a work by Raz (J. ACM and FOCS 16), it was proved that any algorithm for parity learning on n  bits requires either Ω( n  2  ) bits of classical memory or an exponential number (in ‍ n  ) of random samples. A line of recent works continued that research direction and showed that for a large collection of classical learning tasks, either super-linear classical memory size or super-polynomially many samples are needed. All these works consider learning algorithms as classical branching programs, which perform classical computation within bounded memory. However, these results do not capture all physical computational models, remarkably, quantum computers and the use of quantum memory. It leaves the possibility that a small piece of quantum memory could significantly reduce the need for classical memory or samples and thus completely change the nature of the classical learning task. Despite the recent research on the necessity of quantum memory for intrinsic quantum learning problems like shadow tomography and purity testing, the role of quantum memory in classical learning tasks remains obscure. In this work, we study classical learning tasks in the presence of quantum memory. We prove that any quantum algorithm with both, classical memory and quantum memory, for parity learning on n  bits, requires either Ω( n  2  ) bits of classical memory or Ω( n  ) bits of quantum memory or an exponential number of samples. In other words, the memory-sample lower bound for parity learning remains qualitatively the same, even if the learning algorithm can use, in addition to the classical memory, a quantum memory of size c  n  (for some constant c  >0). Our result is more general and applies to many other classical learning tasks. Following previous works, we represent by the matrix M  : A  × X  → {−1,1} the following learning task. An unknown x  is sampled uniformly at random from a concept class X  , and a learning algorithm tries to uncover x  by seeing streaming of random samples ( a  i   , b  i   = M  ( a  i   , x  )) where for every i  , a  i   ∈ A  is chosen uniformly at random. Assume that k  ,ℓ, r  are integers such that any submatrix of M  of at least 2 − k   ·| A  | rows and at least 2 −ℓ  ·| X  | columns, has a bias of at most 2 − r   . We prove that any algorithm with classical and quantum hybrid memory for the learning problem corresponding to M  needs either (1) Ω( k  · ℓ) bits of classical memory, or (2) Ω( r  ) qubits of quantum memory, or (3) 2 Ω( r  )  random samples, to achieve a success probability at least 2 − O  ( r  )  . Our results refute the possibility that a small amount of quantum memory significantly reduces the size of classical memory needed for efficient learning on these problems. Our results also imply improved security of several existing cryptographical protocols in the bounded-storage model (protocols that are based on parity learning on n  bits), proving that security holds even in the presence of a quantum adversary with at most c  n  2  bits of classical memory and c  n  bits of quantum memory (for some constant c  >0).  

 Quantum Depth in the Random Oracle Model

  Matthew Coudron 
  Alexandru Gheorghiu 
  Uttam Singh 
  Hendrik Waldner 
  We give a comprehensive characterisation of the computational power of shallow quantum circuits combined with classical computation. Specifically, for classes of search problems, we show that the following statements hold, relative to a random oracle:  
 (a) BPP  QNC  BPP    ≠ BQP  . This refutes Jozsa’s conjecture in the random oracle model. As a result, this gives the first instantiatable separation between the classes by replacing the oracle with a cryptographic hash function, yielding a resolution to one of Aaronson’s ten semi-grand challenges in quantum computing.  
 (b) BPP  QNC   ⊈ QNC  BPP   and QNC  BPP   ⊈ BPP  QNC   . This shows that there is a subtle interplay between classical computation and shallow quantum computation. In fact, for the second separation, we establish that, for some problems, the ability to perform adaptive measurements in a single shallow quantum circuit, is more useful than the ability to perform polynomially many shallow quantum circuits without adaptive measurements. We also show that BPP  QNC   and BPP  QNC   are both strictly contained in BPP  QNC  BPP    .  
 (c) There exists a 2-message proof of quantum depth protocol. Such a protocol allows a classical verifier to efficiently certify that a prover must be performing a computation of some minimum quantum depth. Our proof of quantum depth can be instantiated using the recent proof of quantumness construction by Yamakawa and Zhandry.  

 Multidimensional Quantum Walks   
 Stacey Jeffery 
  Sebastian Zur 
  While the quantum query complexity of k  -distinctness is known to be O  ( n  3/4 − 1/4(2 k   −1)  ) for any constant k  ≥ 4 [Belovs, FOCS 2012], the best previous upper bound on the time complexity was O  ( n  1−1/ k   ). We give a new upper bound of O  ( n  3/4 − 1/4(2 k   −1)  ) on the time complexity, matching the query complexity up to polylogarithmic factors. In order to achieve this upper bound, we give a new technique for designing quantum walk search algorithms, which is an extension of the electric network framework. We also show how to solve the welded trees problem in O  ( n  ) queries and O  ( n  2  ) time using this new technique, showing that the new quantum walk framework can achieve exponential speedups.  

 Mind the Gap: Achieving a Super-Grover Quantum Speedup by Jumping to the End   
 Alexander M. Dalzell

  Earl T. Campbell 
  Fernando G.S.L. Brandão 
  We present a quantum algorithm that has rigorous runtime guarantees for several families of binary optimization problems, including Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), Ising spin glasses ( p  -spin model), and k  -local constraint satisfaction problems ( k  -CSP). We show that either (a) the algorithm finds the optimal solution in time O  *  (2 (0.5− c  ) n   ) for an n  -independent constant c  , a 2 cn   advantage over Grover’s algorithm; or (b) there are sufficiently many low-cost solutions such that classical random guessing produces a (1−η) approximation to the optimal cost value in sub-exponential time for arbitrarily small choice of η. Additionally, we show that for a large fraction of random instances from the k  -spin model and for any fully satisfiable or slightly frustrated k  -CSP formula, statement (a) is the case. The algorithm and its analysis are largely inspired by Hastings’ short-path algorithm.  

 Approximating Binary Longest Common Subsequence in Almost-Linear Time   
 Xiaoyu He 
  Ray Li 
  The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) is a fundamental string similarity measure, and computing the LCS of two strings is a classic algorithms question. A textbook dynamic programming algorithm gives an exact algorithm in quadratic time, and this is essentially best possible under plausible fine-grained complexity assumptions, so a natural problem is to find faster approximation algorithms. When the inputs are two binary strings, there is a simple 1/2-approximation in linear time: compute the longest common all-0s or all-1s subsequence. It has been open whether a better approximation is possible even in truly subquadratic time. Rubinstein and Song showed that the answer is yes under the assumption that the two input strings have equal lengths. We settle the question, generalizing their result to unequal length strings, proving that, for any ε>0, there exists δ>0 and a (1/2+δ)-approximation algorithm for binary LCS that runs in n  1+ε  time. As a consequence of our result and a result of Akmal and Vassilevska-Williams, for any ε>0, there exists a (1/ q  +δ)-approximation for LCS over q  -ary strings in n  1+ε  time.  
 Our techniques build on the recent work of Guruswami, He, and Li who proved new bounds for error-correcting codes tolerating deletion errors. They prove a combinatorial “structure lemma” for strings which classifies them according to their oscillation patterns. We prove and use an algorithmic generalization of this structure lemma, which may be of independent interest.

 A New Deterministic Algorithm for Fully Dynamic All-Pairs Shortest Paths   
 Julia Chuzhoy 
  Ruimin Zhang 
  We study the fully dynamic All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) problem in undirected edge-weighted graphs. Given an n  -vertex graph G  with non-negative edge lengths, that undergoes an online sequence of edge insertions and deletions, the goal is to support approximate distance queries and shortest-path queries. We provide a deterministic algorithm for this problem, that, for a given precision parameter є, achieves approximation factor (loglog n  ) 2 O  (1/є 3  )   , and has amortized update time O  ( n  є  log L  ) per operation, where L  is the ratio of longest to shortest edge length. Query time for distance-query is O  (2 O  (1/є)  · log n  · loglog L  ), and query time for shortest-path query is O  (| E  ( P  )|+2 O  (1/є)  · log n  · loglog L  ), where P  is the path that the algorithm returns. To the best of our knowledge, even allowing any o  ( n  )-approximation factor, no adaptive-update algorithms with better than Θ( m  ) amortized update time and better than Θ( n  ) query time were known prior to this work. We also note that our guarantees are stronger than the best current guarantees for APSP in decremental graphs in the adaptive-adversary setting.  
 In order to obtain these results, we consider an intermediate problem, called Recursive Dynamic Neighborhood Cover (RecDynNC), that was formally introduced in [Chuzhoy, STOC ’21]. At a high level, given an undirected edge-weighted graph G  undergoing an online sequence of edge deletions, together with a distance parameter D  , the goal is to maintain a sparse D  -neighborhood cover of G  , with some additional technical requirements. Our main technical contribution is twofolds. First, we provide a black-box reduction from APSP in fully dynamic graphs to the RecDynNC problem. Second, we provide a new deterministic algorithm for the RecDynNC problem, that, for a given precision parameter є, achieves approximation factor (loglog m  ) 2 O  (1/є 2  )   , with total update time O  ( m  1+є  ), where m  is the total number of edges ever present in G  . This improves the previous algorithm of [Chuzhoy, STOC ’21], that achieved approximation factor (log m  ) 2 O  (1/є)   with similar total update time. Combining these two results immediately leads to the deterministic algorithm for fully-dynamic APSP with the guarantees stated above.  

 Deterministic Incremental APSP with Polylogarithmic Update Time and Stretch   
 Sebastian Forster 
  Yasamin Nazari

  We provide the first deterministic data structure that given a weighted undirected graph undergoing edge insertions, processes each update with polylogarithmic amortized update time and answers queries for the distance between any pair of vertices in the current graph with a polylogarithmic approximation in O  (loglog n  ) time.  
 Prior to this work, no data structure was known for partially dynamic graphs, i.e., graphs undergoing either edge insertions or deletions, with less than n  o  (1)  update time except for dense graphs, even when allowing randomization against oblivious adversaries or considering only single-source distances.  

 Dynamic ((1+𝜖) ln 𝑛)-Approximation Algorithms for Minimum Set Cover and Dominating Set   
 Shay Solomon 
  Amitai Uzrad 
  The minimum set cover (MSC) problem admits two classic algorithms: a greedy  ln n  -approximation and a primal-dual f  -approximation, where n  is the universe size and f  is the maximum frequency of an element. Both algorithms are simple and efficient, and remarkably — one cannot improve these approximations under hardness results by more than a factor of (1+є), for any constant є > 0.  
 In their pioneering work, Gupta et al. [STOC’17] showed that the greedy algorithm can be dynamized  to achieve O  (log n  )-approximation with update time O  ( f  log n  ). Building on this result, Hjuler et al. [STACS’18] dynamized the greedy minimum dominating set (MDS) algorithm, achieving a similar approximation with update time O  (Δ log n  ) (the analog of O  ( f  log n  )), albeit for unweighted instances. The approximations of both algorithms, which are the state-of-the-art, exceed the static ln n  -approximation by a rather large constant factor. In sharp contrast, the current best dynamic primal-dual  MSC algorithms, by Bhattacharya et al. [SODA’21] and Assadi-Solomon [ESA’21], both with update time O  ( f  2  ) — exceed the static f  -approximation by a factor of (at most) 1+є, for any є > 0.  
 This paper aims to bridge the gap between the best approximation factor of the dynamic  greedy MSC and MDS algorithms and the static  ln n  bound. We present dynamic algorithms for weighted  greedy MSC and MDS with approximation (1+є)ln n  for any є > 0, while achieving the same update time (ignoring dependencies on є) of the best previous algorithms (with approximation significantly larger than ln n  ). Moreover, we prove that the same algorithms achieve O  (min{ log n  , log C  }) amortized recourse  ; the recourse measures the number of changes to the maintained structure per update step, and the cost of each set lies in the range [1/ C  ,1].  

 Improved Dynamic Colouring of Sparse Graphs   
 Aleksander Bjørn Grodt Christiansen 
  Krzysztof Nowicki 
  Eva Rotenberg 
  Given a dynamic graph subject to edge insertions and deletions, we show how to update an implicit representation of a proper vertex colouring, such that colours of vertices are computable upon query time. We give a deterministic algorithm that uses O  (α 2  ) colours for a dynamic graph of arboricity α, and a randomised algorithm that uses O  (min{α logα, α logloglog n  }) colours in the oblivious adversary model. Our deterministic algorithm has update- and query times polynomial in α and log n  , and our randomised algorithm has amortised update- and query time that with high probability is polynomial in log n  with no dependency on the arboricity.  
 Thus, we improve the number of colours exponentially compared to the state-of-the art for implicit colouring, namely from O  (2 α  ) colours, and we approach the theoretical lower bound of Ω(α) for this arboricity-parameterised approach. Simultaneously, our randomised algorithm improves the update- and query time to run in time solely polynomial in log n  with no dependency on α. Our algorithms are fully adaptive to the current value of the dynamic arboricity at query or update time.  

 Dynamic Maxflow via Dynamic Interior Point Methods   
 Jan van den Brand 
  Yang P. Liu 
  Aaron Sidford 
  In this paper we provide an algorithm for maintaining a (1−є)-approximate maximum flow in a dynamic, capacitated graph undergoing edge insertions. Over a sequence of m  insertions to an n  -node graph where every edge has capacity O  ( poly  ( m  )) our algorithm runs in time O  ( m  √ n  · є −1  ). To obtain this result we design dynamic data structures for the more general problem of detecting when the value of the minimum cost circulation in a dynamic graph undergoing edge insertions achieves value at most F  (exactly) for a given threshold F  . Over a sequence m  insertions to an n  -node graph where every edge has capacity O  ( poly  ( m  )) and cost O  ( poly  ( m  )) we solve this thresholded minimum cost flow problem in O  ( m  √ n  ). Both of our algorithms succeed with high probability against an adaptive adversary. We obtain these results by dynamizing the recent interior point method by [Chen et al. ‍FOCS 2022] used to obtain an almost linear time algorithm for minimum cost flow, and introducing a new dynamic data structure for maintaining minimum ratio cycles in an undirected graph that succeeds with high probability against adaptive adversaries.  

 Fast Algorithms via Dynamic-Oracle Matroids   
 Joakim Blikstad 
  Sagnik Mukhopadhyay 
  Danupon Nanongkai 
  Ta-Wei Tu 
  We initiate the study of matroid problems in a new oracle model called dynamic oracle  . Our algorithms in this model lead to new bounds for some classic problems, and a “unified” algorithm whose performance matches previous results developed in various papers for various problems. We also show a lower bound that answers some open problems from a few decades ago. Concretely, our results are as follows.  
 Improved algorithms for matroid union and disjoint spanning trees. We show an algorithm with Õ k   ( n  + r  √ r  ) dynamic-rank-query and time complexities for the matroid union problem over k  matroids, where n  is the input size, r  is the output size, and Õ k   hides poly  ( k  , log( n  )). This implies the following consequences. (i) An improvement over the Õ k   ( n  √ r  ) bound implied by [Chakrabarty-Lee-Sidford-Singla-Wong FOCS’19] for matroid union in the traditional rank-query model. (ii) An Õ k   (| E  |+| V  |√| V  |)-time algorithm for the k  -disjoint spanning tree problem. This is nearly linear for moderately dense input graphs and improves the Õ k   (| V  |√| E  |) bounds of Gabow-Westermann [STOC’88] and Gabow [STOC’91]. Consequently, this gives improved bounds for, e.g., Shannon Switching Game and Graph Irreducibility.  
 Matroid intersection. We show a matroid intersection algorithm with Õ( n  √ r  ) dynamic-rank-query and time complexities. This implies new bounds for some problems (e.g. maximum forest with deadlines) and bounds that match the classic ones obtained in various papers for various problems, e.g. colorful spanning tree [Gabow-Stallmann ICALP’85], graphic matroid intersection [Gabow-Xu FOCS’89], simple job scheduling matroid intersection [Xu-Gabow ISAAC’94], and Hopcroft-Karp combinatorial bipartite matching. More importantly, this is done via a “unified” algorithm in the sense that an improvement over our dynamic-rank-query algorithm would imply improved bounds for all  the above problems simultaneously.  
 Lower bounds. We show simple super-linear (Ω( n  log n  )) query lower bounds for matroid intersection and union problems in our dynamic-rank-oracle and the traditional independence-query models; the latter improves the previous log 2  (3) n  − o  ( n  ) bound by Harvey [SODA’08] and answers an open problem raised by, e.g., Welsh [1976] and CLSSW [FOCS’19].

 Hard Languages in NP ∩ coNP and NIZK Proofs from Unstructured Hardness

  Eyal Kushilevitz 
  Paul Lou 
  Amit Sahai 
  The existence of “unstructured” hard languages in NP  ∩ coNP  is an intriguing open question. Bennett and Gill (SICOMP, 1981) asked whether P  is separated from NP  ∩ coNP  relative to a random oracle, a question that remained open ever since. While a hard language in NP  ∩ coNP  can be constructed in a black-box way from a one-way permutation  , for which only few (structured) candidates exist, Bitansky et al. (SICOMP, 2021) ruled out such a construction based on an injective one-way function  , an unstructured primitive that is easy to instantiate heuristically. In fact, the latter holds even with a black-box use of indistinguishability obfuscation.  
 We give the first evidence for the existence of unstructured hard languages in NP  ∩ coNP  by showing that if UP  ⊈ RP  , which follows from the existence of injective one-way functions, the answer to Bennett and Gill’s question is affirmative: with probability 1 over a random oracle O  , we have that P  O   ≠ NP  O   ∩ coNP  O   . Our proof gives a constructive non-black-box  approach for obtaining candidate hard languages in NP  ∩ coNP  from cryptographic hash functions.  
 The above conditional separation builds on a new construction of non-interactive zero-knowledge  (NIZK) proofs, with a computationally unbounded prover, to convert a hard promise problem into a hard language. We obtain such NIZK proofs for NP  , with a uniformly random  reference string, from a special kind of hash function which is implied by (an unstructured) random oracle. This should be contrasted with previous constructions of such NIZK proofs that are based on one-way permutations or other structured  primitives, as well as with (computationally sound) NIZK arguments  in the random oracle model.  

 On the Consistency of Circuit Lower Bounds for Non-deterministic Time   
 Albert Atserias 
  Sam Buss 
  Moritz Müller 
  We prove the first unconditional consistency result for superpolynomial circuit lower bounds with a relatively strong theory of bounded arithmetic. Namely, we show that the theory ‍V 2  0  is consistent with the conjecture that ‍NEXP ‍⊈ ‍P/poly, i.e., some problem that is solvable in non-deterministic exponential time does not have polynomial size circuits. We suggest this is the best currently available evidence for the truth of the conjecture. Additionally, we establish a magnification result on the hardness of proving circuit lower bounds.  

 Shellability Is Hard Even for Balls   
 Pavel Paták 
  Martin Tancer 
  The main goal of this paper is to show that shellability is NP-hard for triangulated d  -balls (this also gives hardness for triangulated d  -manifolds/ d  -pseudomanifolds with boundary) as soon as d  ≥ 3. This extends our earlier work with Goaoc, Patáková and Wagner on hardness of shellability of 2-complexes and answers some questions implicitly raised by Danaraj and Klee in 1978 and explicitly mentioned by Santamaría-Galvis and Woodroofe. Together with the main goal, we also prove that collapsibility is NP-hard for 3-complexes embeddable in 3-space, extending an earlier work of the second author and answering an open question mentioned by Cohen, Fasy, Miller, Nayyeri, Peng and Walkington; and that shellability is NP-hard for 2-complexes embeddable in 3-space, answering another question of Santamaría-Galvis and Woodroofe (in a slightly stronger form than what is given by the main result).  

 The Complexity of Counting Planar Graph Homomorphisms of Domain Size 3   
 Jin-Yi Cai 
  Ashwin Maran 
  We prove a complexity dichotomy theorem for counting planar graph homomorphisms of domain size 3. Given any 3 by 3 real valued symmetric matrix H  defining a graph homomorphism from all planar graphs G  ↦ Z  H   ( G  ), we completely classify the computational complexity of this problem according to the matrix H  . We show that for every H  , the problem is either polynomial time computable or #P-hard. The P-time computable cases consist of precisely those that are P-time computable for general graphs (a complete classification is known) or computable by Valiant’s holographic algorithm via matchgates. We also prove several results about planar graph homomorphisms for general domain size q  . The proof uses mainly analytic arguments.

 Approximating Nash Social Welfare by Matching and Local Search   
 Jugal Garg 
  Edin Husić 
  Wenzheng Li 
  László A. Végh 
  Jan Vondrák 
  For any >0, we give a simple, deterministic (4+)-approximation algorithm for the Nash social welfare (NSW) problem under submodular valuations. The previous best approximation factor was 380 via a randomized algorithm. We also consider the asymmetric variant of the problem, where the objective is to maximize the weighted geometric mean of agents’ valuations, and give an (ω + 2 + ) -approximation if the ratio between the largest weight and the average weight is at most ω.  
 We also show that the 12-EFX envy-freeness property can be attained simultaneously with a constant-factor approximation. More precisely, we can find an allocation in polynomial time which is both 12-EFX and a (8+)-approximation to the symmetric NSW problem under submodular valuations. The previous best approximation factor under 12-EFX was linear in the number of agents.  

 Multi-agent Contracts   
 Paul Dütting 
  Tomer Ezra 
  Michal Feldman 
  Thomas Kesselheim 
  We study a natural combinatorial single-principal multi-agent contract design problem, in which a principal motivates a team of agents to exert effort toward a given task. At the heart of our model is a reward function  , which maps the agent efforts to an expected reward of the principal. We seek to design computationally efficient algorithms for finding optimal (or near-optimal) linear contracts for reward functions that belong to the complement-free hierarchy.  
 Our first main result gives constant-factor approximation algorithms for submodular and XOS reward functions, with value and demand oracles, respectively. It relies on an unconventional use of “prices” and (approximate) demand queries for selecting the set of agents that the principal should contract with, and exploits a novel scaling property of XOS functions and their marginals, which may be of independent interest.  
 Our second main result is an Ω(√ n  ) impossibility for settings with n  agents and subadditive reward functions, even with demand oracle access. A striking feature of this impossibility is that it applies to subadditive functions that are constant-factor close to submodular. This presents a surprising departure from previous literature, e.g., on combinatorial auctions.  

 Approximate Max-Flow Min-Multicut Theorem for Graphs of Bounded Treewidth   
 Tobias Friedrich 
  Davis Issac 
  Nikhil Kumar 
  Nadym Mallek 
  Ziena Zeif 
  We prove an approximate max-multiflow min-multicut theorem for bounded treewidth graphs. In particular, we show the following: Given a treewidth- r  graph, there exists a (fractional) multicommodity flow of value f  , and a multicut of capacity c  such that f  ≤ c  ≤ O  (ln( r  +1)) · f  . It is well known that the multiflow-multicut gap on an r  -vertex (constant degree) expander graph can be Ω(ln r  ), and hence our result is tight up to constant factors. Our proof is constructive, and we also obtain a polynomial time O  (ln( r  +1))-approximation algorithm for the minimum multicut problem on treewidth- r  graphs. Our algorithm proceeds by rounding the optimal fractional solution to the natural linear programming relaxation of the multicut problem. We introduce novel modifications to the well-known region growing algorithm to facilitate the rounding while guaranteeing at most a logarithmic factor loss in the treewidth.  

 A PTAS for Minimizing Weighted Flow Time on a Single Machine   
 Alexander Armbruster 
  Lars Rohwedder 
  Andreas Wiese 
  An important objective function in the scheduling literature is to minimize the sum of weighted flow times. We are given a set of jobs, where each job is characterized by a release time, a processing time, and a weight. Our goal is to find a preemptive schedule on a single machine that minimizes the sum of the weighted flow times of the jobs, where the flow time of a job is the time between its completion time and its release time. The currently best known polynomial time algorithm for the problem is a (2+є)-approximation by Rohwedder and Wiese [STOC 2021], which builds on the prior break-through result by Batra, Garg, and Kumar [FOCS 2018] who found the first pseudo-polynomial time constant factor approximation algorithm for the problem, and on the result by Feige, Kulkarni, and Li [SODA 2019] who turned the latter into a polynomial time algorithm. However, it remains open whether the problem admits a PTAS.  
 We answer this question in the affirmative and present a polynomial time (1+є)-approximation algorithm for weighted flow time on a single machine. We use a reduction of the problem to a geometric covering problem, which was introduced in the mentioned (2+є)-approximation algorithm and which loses only a factor of 1+є in the approximation ratio. However, unlike that algorithm, we solve the resulting instances of the covering problem exactly, rather than losing a factor 2+є. Key for this is to identify and exploit structural properties of instances of that problem covering problem which arise in the reduction from weighted flow time.

 Random Graph Matching at Otter’s Threshold via Counting Chandeliers   
 Cheng Mao 
  Yihong Wu 
  Jiaming Xu 
  Sophie H. Yu 
  We propose an efficient algorithm for graph matching based on similarity scores constructed from counting a certain family of weighted trees rooted at each vertex. For two Erdős–Rényi graphs G  ( n  , q  ) whose edges are correlated through a latent vertex correspondence, we show that this algorithm correctly matches all but a vanishing fraction of the vertices with high probability, provided that nq  →∞ and the edge correlation coefficient ρ satisfies ρ 2  >α ≈ 0.338, where α is Otter’s tree-counting constant. Moreover, this almost exact matching can be made exact under an extra condition that is information-theoretically necessary. This is the first polynomial-time graph matching algorithm that succeeds at an explicit constant correlation and applies to both sparse and dense graphs. In comparison, previous methods either require ρ=1− o  (1) or are restricted to sparse graphs.  
 The crux of the algorithm is a carefully curated family of rooted trees called chandeliers  , which allows effective extraction of the graph correlation from the counts of the same tree while suppressing the undesirable correlation between those of different trees.  

 Uniformly Random Colourings of Sparse Graphs   
 Eoin Hurley 
  François Pirot 
  We analyse uniformly random proper k  -colourings of sparse graphs with maximum degree Δ in the regime Δ < k  ln k  . This regime corresponds to the lower side of the shattering threshold for random graph colouring, a paradigmatic example of the shattering threshold for random Constraint Satisfaction Problems. We prove a variety of results about the solution space geometry of colourings of fixed graphs, generalising work of Achlioptas and Coja-Oghlan, and Molloy on random graphs, and justifying the performance of stochastic local search algorithms in this regime. Our central proof relies only on elementary techniques, namely the first-moment method and a quantitative induction, yet it strengthens list-colouring results due to Vu, and more recently Davies, Kang, P., and Sereni, and generalises state-of-the-art bounds from Ramsey theory in the context of sparse graphs. It further yields an approximately tight lower bound on the number of colourings, also known as the partition function of the Potts model, with implications for efficient approximate counting.  

 Maximum Length-Constrained Flows and Disjoint Paths: Distributed, Deterministic, and Fast   
 Bernhard Haeupler 
  D. Ellis Hershkowitz 
  Thatchaphol Saranurak 
  Computing routing schemes that support both high throughput and low latency is one of the core challenges of network optimization. Such routes can be formalized as h  -length flows which are defined as flows whose flow paths have length at most h  . Many well-studied algorithmic primitives—such as maximal and maximum length-constrained disjoint paths—are special cases of h  -length flows. Likewise the optimal h  -length flow is a fundamental quantity in network optimization, characterizing, up to poly-log factors, how quickly a network can accomplish numerous distributed primitives.  
 In this work, we give the first efficient algorithms for computing (1 − є)-approximate h  -length flows that are nearly “as integral as possible.” We give deterministic algorithms that take Õ(poly( h  , 1/є)) parallel time and Õ(poly( h  , 1/є) · 2 O  (√log n  )  ) distributed CONGEST time. We also give a CONGEST algorithm that succeeds with high probability and only takes Õ(poly( h  , 1/є)) time.  
 Using our h  -length flow algorithms, we give the first efficient deterministic CONGEST algorithms for the maximal disjoint paths problem with length constraints—settling an open question of Chang and Saranurak (FOCS 2020)—as well as essentially-optimal parallel and distributed approximation algorithms for maximum length-constrained disjoint paths. The former greatly simplifies deterministic CONGEST algorithms for computing expander decompositions. We also use our techniques to give the first efficient and deterministic (1−є)-approximation algorithms for bipartite b  -matching in CONGEST. Lastly, using our flow algorithms, we give the first algorithms to efficiently compute h  -length cutmatches, an object at the heart of recent advances in length-constrained expander decompositions.  

 Tight Conditional Lower Bounds for Vertex Connectivity Problems   
 Zhiyi Huang 
  Yaowei Long 
  Thatchaphol Saranurak 
  Benyu Wang 
  We study the fine-grained complexity of graph connectivity problems in unweighted undirected graphs. Recent development shows that all variants of edge connectivity  problems, including single-source-single-sink, global, Steiner, single-source, and all-pairs connectivity, are solvable in m  1+ o  (1)  time, collapsing the complexity of these problems into the almost-linear-time regime. While, historically, vertex connectivity  has been much harder, the recent results showed that both single-source-single-sink and global vertex connectivity can be solved in m  1+ o  (1)  time, raising the hope of putting all variants of vertex connectivity problems into the almost-linear-time regime too.  
 We show that this hope is impossible, assuming conjectures on finding 4-cliques. Moreover, we essentially settle the complexity landscape by giving tight bounds for combinatorial  algorithms in dense graphs. There are three separate regimes:  
 (1) all-pairs and Steiner vertex connectivity have complexity Θ( n  4  ),  
 (2) single-source vertex connectivity has complexity Θ( n  3  ), and  
 (3) single-source-single-sink and global vertex connectivity have complexity Θ( n  2  ).  
 For graphs with general density, we obtain tight bounds of Θ( m  2  ), Θ( m  1.5  ), Θ( m  ), respectively, assuming Gomory-Hu trees for element connectivity can be computed in almost-linear time.

  An f  -edge fault-tolerant distance sensitive oracle ( f  -DSO) with stretch σ ≥ 1 is a data structure that preprocesses a given undirected, unweighted graph G  with n  vertices and m  edges, and a positive integer f  . When queried with a pair of vertices s  , t  and a set F  of at most f  edges, it returns a σ-approximation of the s  - t  -distance in G  − F  .  
 We study f  -DSOs that take subquadratic space. Thorup and Zwick [JACM ‍2015] showed that this is only possible for σ ≥ 3. We present, for any constant f  ≥ 1 and α ∈ (0, 1/2), and any ε > 0, an f  -DSO with stretch 3 + that takes O  ( n  2−α/ f  +1  /ε) · O  (log n  /ε) f  +1  space and has an O  ( n  α  /ε 2  ) query time.  
 We also give an improved construction for graphs with diameter at most D  . For any constant k  , we devise an f  -DSO with stretch 2 k  −1 that takes O  ( D  f  + o  (1)  n  1+1/ k   ) space and has O  ( D  o  (1)  ) query time, with a preprocessing time of O  ( D  f  + o  (1)  mn  1/ k   ).  
 Chechik, Cohen, Fiat, and Kaplan [SODA 2017] presented an f  -DSO with stretch 1+ and preprocessing time O  ( n  5  ) · O  (log n  /ε) f   , albeit with a super-quadratic space requirement. We show how to reduce their preprocessing time to O  ( mn  2  ) · O  (log n  /ε) f   .  

 External Memory Fully Persistent Search Trees   
 Gerth Stølting Brodal 
  Casper Moldrup Rysgaard 
  Rolf Svenning 
  We present the first fully-persistent external-memory search tree achieving amortized I/O bounds matching those of the classic (ephemeral) B-tree by Bayer and McCreight. The insertion and deletion of a value in any version requires amortized O  (log B   N  v   ) I/Os and a range reporting query in any version requires worst-case O  (log B   N  v   + K  / B  ) I/Os, where K  is the number of values reported, N  v   is the number of values in the version v  of the tree queried or updated, and B  is the external-memory block size. The data structure requires space linear in the total number of updates. Compared to the previous best bounds for fully persistent B-trees [Brodal, Sioutas, Tsakalidis, and Tsichlas, SODA 2012], this paper eliminates from the update bound an additive term of O  (log 2  B  ) I/Os. This result matches the previous best bounds for the restricted case of partial persistent B-trees [Arge, Danner and Teh, JEA 2003]. Central to our approach is to consider the problem as a dynamic set of two-dimensional rectangles that can be merged and split.  

 The Rate of Interactive Codes Is Bounded Away from 1   
 Klim Efremenko 
  Gillat Kol 
  Dmitry Paramonov 
  Raghuvansh R. Saxena 
  Kol and Raz [STOC 2013] showed how to simulate any alternating  two-party communication protocol designed to work over the noiseless channel, by a protocol that works over a stochastic channel that corrupts each sent symbol with probability ‍є>0 independently, with only a 1+ O  (√(є)) blowup to the communication. In particular, this implies that the maximum rate  of such interactive codes  approaches 1 as є goes to ‍0, as is also the case for the maximum rate of classical error correcting codes. Over the past decade, followup works have strengthened and generalized this result to other noisy channels, stressing on how fast the rate approaches 1 as є goes to 0, but retaining the assumption that the noiseless protocol is alternating.  
 In this paper we consider the general case, where the noiseless protocols can have arbitrary orders of speaking  . In contrast to Kol-Raz and to the followup results in this model, we show that the maximum rate of interactive codes that encode general protocols is upper bounded by a universal constant strictly smaller than 1. To put it differently, we show that there is an inherent blowup in communication when protocols with arbitrary orders of speaking are faced with any constant fraction of errors ‍є > 0. We mention that our result assumes a large alphabet set and resolves the (non-binary variant) of a conjecture by Haeupler [FOCS ‍2014].  

 A Near-Cubic Lower Bound for 3-Query Locally Decodable Codes from Semirandom CSP Refutation   
 Omar Alrabiah 
  Venkatesan Guruswami 
  Pravesh K. Kothari 
  Peter Manohar 
  A code C  ∶ {0,1} k   → {0,1} n   is a q  -locally decodable code ( q  -LDC) if one can recover any chosen bit b  i   of the message b  ∈ {0,1} k   with good confidence by randomly querying the encoding x  = C  ( b  ) on at most q  coordinates. Existing constructions of 2-LDCs achieve n  = exp( O  ( k  )), and lower bounds show that this is in fact tight. However, when q  = 3, far less is known: the best constructions achieve n  = exp( k  o  (1)  ), while the best known results only show a quadratic lower bound n  ≥ Ω( k  2  /log( k  )) on the blocklength.  
 In this paper, we prove a near-cubic lower bound of n  ≥ Ω( k  3  /log 6  ( k  )) on the blocklength of 3-query LDCs. This improves on the best known prior works by a polynomial factor in k  . Our proof relies on a new connection between LDCs and refuting constraint satisfaction problems with limited randomness. Our quantitative improvement builds on the new techniques for refuting semirandom instances of CSPs and, in particular, relies on bounding the spectral norm of appropriate Kikuchi matrices.  

 Efficient Interactive Coding Achieving Optimal Error Resilience over the Binary Channel   
 Meghal Gupta 
  Rachel Yun Zhang 
  Given a noiseless protocol π 0  computing a function f  ( x  , y  ) of Alice and Bob’s private inputs x  , y  , the goal of interactive coding is to construct an error-resilient protocol π computing f  such that even if some fraction of the communication is adversarially corrupted, both parties still learn f  ( x  , y  ). Ideally, the resulting scheme π should be positive rate, computationally efficient, and achieve optimal error resilience.  
 While interactive coding over large alphabets is well understood, the situation over the binary alphabet has remained evasive. At the present moment, the known schemes over the binary alphabet that achieve a higher error resilience than a trivial adaptation of large alphabet schemes are either still suboptimally error resilient, or optimally error resilient with exponential communication complexity. In this work, we construct a scheme achieving optimality in all three parameters: our protocol is positive rate, computationally efficient, and resilient to the optimal 1/6 − є adversarial errors.  
 Our protocol employs a new type of code that we call a layered code, which may be of independent interest. Like a tree code, a layered code allows the coder to encode a message in an online fashion, but is defined on a graph instead of a tree.  

 A High Dimensional Goldreich-Levin Theorem   
 Parker Newton 
  Silas Richelson 
  Chase Wilson 
  In this work we prove a high dimensional analogue of the beloved Goldreich-Levin Theorem (STOC 1989). We consider the following algorithmic problem: given oracle access to a function f  :ℤ q   m   →ℤ q   n   such that Pr x  ∼ℤ q   m    [ f  ( x  )= Ax  ]≥ε for some A  ∈ℤ q   n  × m   and ε>0, recover A  (or a list of all such matrices). We focus on the case ε≤ 1/ q  since when ε ≥ 1/ q  +δ, the problem is solved by the original Goldreich-Levin Theorem. As stated, this problem cannot be efficiently solved, since when ε ≤ 1/ q  the list of A  with good agreement with f  might be exponentially large. Our main theorem gives an algorithm which efficiently recovers a list of affine maps of size (1/ε ) which have good agreement with f  , and such that every linear map which has good agreement with f  , also has good agreement with some affine map in our list. Our proof makes novel use of Fourier analysis. Our main theorem has applications to effective property testing.  

 Binary Error-Correcting Codes with Minimal Noiseless Feedback   
 Meghal Gupta 
  Venkatesan Guruswami 
  Rachel Yun Zhang 
  In the setting of error-correcting codes with feedback, Alice wishes to communicate a k  -bit message x  to Bob by sending a sequence of bits over a channel while noiselessly receiving feedback from Bob. It has been long known (Berlekamp, 1964) that in this model, Bob can still correctly determine x  even if ≈ 1/3 of Alice’s bits are flipped adversarially. This improves upon the classical setting without feedback, where recovery is not possible for error fractions exceeding 1/4.  
 The original feedback setting assumes that after transmitting each bit, Alice knows (via feedback) what bit Bob received. In this work, our focus in on the limited feedback model, where Bob is only allowed to send a few bits at a small number of pre-designated points in the protocol. For any desired є > 0, we construct a coding scheme that tolerates a fraction 1/3−є of bit flips relying only on O  є  (log k  ) bits of feedback from Bob sent in a fixed O  є  (1) number of rounds. We complement this with a matching lower bound showing that Ω(log k  ) bits of feedback are necessary to recover from an error fraction exceeding 1/4 (the threshold without any feedback), and for schemes resilient to a fraction 1/3−є of bit flips, the number of rounds must grow as є → 0.  
 We also study (and resolve) the question for the simpler model of erasures. We show that O  є  (log k  ) bits of feedback spread over O  є  (1) rounds suffice to tolerate a fraction (1−є) of erasures. Likewise, our Ω(log k  ) lower bound applies for erasure fractions exceeding 1/2, and an increasing number of rounds are required as the erasure fraction approaches 1.  

 Generic Reed-Solomon Codes Achieve List-Decoding Capacity   
 Joshua Brakensiek 
  Sivakanth Gopi 
  Visu Makam 
  In a recent paper, Brakensiek, Gopi and Makam introduced higher order MDS codes as a generalization of MDS codes. An order-ℓ MDS code, denoted by MDS(ℓ), has the property that any ℓ subspaces formed from columns of its generator matrix intersect as minimally as possible. An independent work by Roth defined a different notion of higher order MDS codes as those achieving a generalized singleton bound for list-decoding. In this work, we show that these two notions of higher order MDS codes are (nearly) equivalent.  
 We also show that generic Reed-Solomon codes are MDS(ℓ) for all ℓ, relying crucially on the GM-MDS theorem which shows that generator matrices of generic Reed-Solomon codes achieve any possible zero pattern. As a corollary, this implies that generic Reed-Solomon codes achieve list decoding capacity. More concretely, we show that, with high probability, a random Reed-Solomon code of rate R  over an exponentially large field is list decodable from radius 1− R  −є with list size at most (1− R  −є)/є, resolving a conjecture of Shangguan and Tamo.  

 Optimal Bounds for Noisy Sorting   
 Yuzhou Gu 
  Yinzhan Xu 
  Sorting is a fundamental problem in computer science. In the classical setting, it is well-known that (1± o  (1)) n  log 2  n  comparisons are both necessary and sufficient to sort a list of n  elements. In this paper, we study the Noisy Sorting problem, where each comparison result is flipped independently with probability p  for some fixed p  ∈ (0, 1/2). As our main result, we show that (1± o  (1)) ( 1/ I  ( p  ) + 1/(1−2 p  ) log 2  (1− p  / p  ) ) n  log 2  n  noisy comparisons are both necessary and sufficient to sort n  elements with error probability o  (1) using noisy comparisons, where I  ( p  )=1 + p  log 2  p  +(1− p  )log 2  (1− p  ) is capacity of BSC channel with crossover probability p  . This simultaneously improves the previous best lower and upper bounds (Wang, Ghaddar and Wang, ISIT 2022) for this problem.  
 For the related Noisy Binary Search problem, we show that (1± o  (1)) ((1−δ)log 2  ( n  )/ I  ( p  ) + 2 log 2  (1/δ)/(1−2 p  )log 2  (1− p  / p  )) noisy comparisons are both necessary and sufficient to find the predecessor of an element among n  sorted elements with error probability δ. This extends the previous bounds of (Burnashev and Zigangirov, 1974), which are only tight for δ = 1/ n  o  (1)  .

  We study the complexity of lattice problems in a world where algorithms, reductions, and protocols can run in superpolynomial time. Specifically, we revisit four foundational results in this context—two protocols and two worst-case to average-case reductions. We show how to improve the approximation factor in each result by a factor of roughly √ n  /log n  when running the protocol or reduction in 2 є n   time instead of polynomial time, and we show a novel protocol with no polynomial-time analog. Our results are as follows.  
 (1) We show a worst-case to average-case reduction proving that secret-key cryptography (specifically, collision-resistant hash functions) exists if the (decision version of the) Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) cannot be approximated to within a factor of Õ(√ n  ) in 2 є n   time. This extends to our setting Ajtai’s celebrated polynomial-time reduction for the Short Integer Solutions (SIS) problem (1996),which showed (after improvements by Micciancio and Regev (2004, 2007)) that secret-key cryptography exists if SVP cannot be approximated to within a factor of Õ( n  ) in polynomial time.  
 (2) We show another worst-case to average-case reduction proving that public-key  cryptography exists if SVP cannot be approximated to within a factor of Õ( n  ) in 2 є n   time. This extends Regev’s celebrated polynomial-time reduction for the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem (2005, 2009), which achieved an approximation factor of Õ( n  1.5  ). In fact, Regev’s reduction is quantum, but we prove our result under a classical reduction, generalizing Peikert’s polynomial-time classical reduction (2009), which achieved an approximation factor of Õ( n  2  ).  
 (3) We show that the (decision version of the) Closest Vector Problem (CVP) with a constant approximation factor has a coAM  protocol with a 2 є n   -time verifier. We prove this via a (very simple) generalization of the celebrated polynomial-time protocol due to Goldreich and Goldwasser (1998, 2000). It follows that the recent series of 2 є n   -time and even 2 (1−є) n   -time hardness results for CVP cannot be extended to large constant approximation factors γ unless AMETH is false. We also rule out 2 (1−є) n   -time lower bounds for any constant approximation factor γ > √2, under plausible complexity-theoretic assumptions. (These results also extend to arbitrary norms, with different constants.)  
 (4) We show that O  (√log n  )-approximate SVP has a coNTIME  protocol with a 2 є n   -time verifier. Here, the analogous (also celebrated!) polynomial-time result is due to Aharonov and Regev (2005), who showed a polynomial-time protocol achieving an approximation factor of √ n  (for both  SVP and CVP, while we only achieve this result for CVP). This result implies similar barriers to hardness, with a larger approximation factor under a weaker complexity-theoretic conjectures (as does the next result).  
 (5) Finally, we give a novel coMA  protocol for constant-factor-approximate CVP with a 2 є n   -time verifier. Unlike our other results, this protocol has no known analog in the polynomial-time regime.  
 All of the results described above are special cases of more general theorems that achieve time-approximation factor tradeoffs. In particular, the tradeoffs for the first four results smoothly interpolate from the polynomial-time results in prior work to our new results in the exponential-time world.

 The Round Complexity of Statistical MPC with Optimal Resiliency   
 Benny Applebaum 
  Eliran Kachlon 
  Arpita Patra 
  In STOC 1989, Rabin and Ben-Or (RB) established an important milestone in the fields of cryptography and distributed computing by showing that every functionality can be computed with statistical (information-theoretic) security in the presence of an active (aka Byzantine) rushing adversary that controls up to half of the parties. We study the round complexity of general secure multiparty computation and several related tasks in the RB model.  
 Our main result shows that every functionality can be realized in only four rounds of interaction which is known to be optimal. This completely settles the round complexity of statistical actively-secure optimally-resilient MPC, resolving a long line of research.  
 Along the way, we construct the first round-optimal statistically-secure verifiable secret sharing protocol (Chor, Goldwasser, Micali, and Awerbuch; STOC 1985), show that every single-input functionality (e.g., multi-verifier zero-knowledge) can be realized in 3 rounds, and prove that the latter bound is optimal. The complexity of all our protocols is exponential in the number of parties, and the question of deriving polynomially-efficient protocols is left for future research.  
 Our main technical contribution is a construction of a new type of statistically-secure signature scheme whose existence was open even for smaller resiliency thresholds. We also describe a new statistical compiler that lifts up passively-secure protocols to actively-secure protocols in a round-efficient way via the aid of protocols for single-input functionalities. This compiler can be viewed as a statistical variant of the GMW compiler (Goldreich, Micali, Wigderson; STOC, 1987) that originally employed zero-knowledge proofs and public-key encryption.  

 Constant-Round Arguments from One-Way Functions   
 Noga Amit 
  Guy N. Rothblum 
  We study the following question: what cryptographic assumptions are needed for obtaining constant-round computationally-sound argument systems? We focus on argument systems with almost-linear verification time for subclasses of P  , such as depth-bounded computations. Kilian’s celebrated work [STOC 1992] provides such 4-message arguments for P  (actually, for NP  ) using collision-resistant hash functions. We show that one  - way  functions  suffice for obtaining constant-round arguments of almost-linear verification time for languages in P  that have log-space uniform circuits of linear depth and polynomial size. More generally, the complexity of the verifier scales with the circuit depth. Furthermore, our argument systems (like Kilian’s) are doubly-efficient; that is, the honest prover strategy can be implemented in polynomial-time. Unconditionally sound interactive proofs for this class of computations do not rely on any cryptographic assumptions, but they require a linear number of rounds [Goldwasser, Kalai and Rothblum, STOC 2008]. Constant-round interactive proof systems of linear verification complexity are not known even for NC  (indeed, even for AC  1  ).  

 Boosting Batch Arguments and RAM Delegation   
 Yael Kalai 
  Alex Lombardi 
  Vinod Vaikuntanathan 
  Daniel Wichs 
  We show how to generically  improve the succinctness of non-interactive publicly verifiable batch argument ( BARG  ) systems. In particular, we show (under a mild additional assumption) how to convert a BARG  that generates proofs of length poly  ( m  )· k  1−є  , where m  is the length of a single instance and k  is the number of instances being batched, into one that generates proofs of length poly  ( m  , log k  ), which is the gold standard for succinctness of BARG  s. By prior work, such BARG  s imply the existence of SNARG  s for deterministic time T  computation with succinctness poly  (log T  ).  
 Our result reduces the long-standing challenge of building publicly-verifiable delegation schemes to a much easier problem: building a batch argument system that beats the trivial construction.  It also immediately implies new constructions of BARG  s and SNARG  s with polylogarithmic succinctness based on either bilinear maps or a combination of the DDH  and QR  assumptions.  
 Along the way, we prove an equivalence  between BARG  s and a new notion of SNARG  s for (deterministic) RAM  computations that we call “ flexible  RAM   SNARG  s with partial input soundness  .” This is the first demonstration that SNARG  s for deterministic computation (of any kind) imply BARG  s. Our RAM  SNARG  notion is of independent interest and has already been used in a recent work on constructing rate-1 BARG  s (Devadas et. ‍al. FOCS 2022).  

 Succinct Computational Secret Sharing

  A secret-sharing scheme enables a dealer to share a secret s  among n  parties such that only authorized subsets of parties, specified by a monotone access structure  f  :{0,1} n   →{0,1}, can reconstruct s  from their shares. Other subsets of parties learn nothing about s  .  
 The question of minimizing the (largest) share size  for a given f  has been the subject of a large body of work. However, in most existing constructions for general access structures f  , the share size is not much smaller than the size of some natural computational representation of the access structure f  , a fact that has often been referred to as the “representation size barrier” in secret sharing.  
 In this work, we initiate a systematic study of succinct computational secret sharing  (SCSS), where the secrecy requirement is computational and the goal is to substantially beat the representation size barrier. We obtain the following main results.  
 First, we introduce the notion of a projective PRG  , a pseudorandom generator for which any subset of the output bits can be revealed while keeping the other output bits hidden, using a short  projective seed. We construct projective PRGs with different levels of succinctness under a variety of computational assumptions, and apply them towards constructing SCSS for graph access structures, monotone CNF formulas, and (less succinctly) useful subclasses of monotone circuits and branching programs. Most notably, under the sub-exponential RSA assumption, we obtain a SCSS scheme that, given an arbitrary  access structure f  , represented by a truth table of size N  =2 n   , produces shares of size polylog  ( N  )= poly  ( n  ) in time Õ( N  ). For comparison, the share size of the best known information-theoretic schemes is O  ( N  0.58  ).  
 Secondly, under the (minimal) assumption that one-way functions exist, we obtain a near-quadratic separation between the total share size of computational and information-theoretic secret sharing. This is the strongest separation one can hope for, given the state of the art in secret sharing lower bounds. We also construct SCSS schemes from one-way functions for useful classes of access structures, including forbidden graphs and monotone DNF formulas. This leads to constructions of fully-decomposable conditional disclosure of secrets (also known as privacy-free garbled circuits) for general functions, represented by a truth table of size N  =2 n   , with share size polylog  ( N  ) and computation time Õ( N  ), assuming sub-exponentially secure one-way functions.  

 Obfuscation of Pseudo-Deterministic Quantum Circuits   
 James Bartusek 
  Fuyuki Kitagawa 
  Ryo Nishimaki 
  Takashi Yamakawa 
  We show how to obfuscate pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits, assuming the quantum hardness of learning with errors (QLWE) and post-quantum virtual black-box (VBB) obfuscation for classical circuits. Given the classical description of a quantum circuit Q  , our obfuscator outputs a quantum state Q  that can be used to evaluate Q  repeatedly on arbitrary inputs.  
 Instantiating the VBB obfuscator for classical circuits with any candidate post-quantum indistinguishability obfuscator gives us the first candidate construction of indistinguishability obfuscation for all polynomial-size pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits. In particular, our scheme is the first candidate obfuscator for a class of circuits that is powerful enough to implement Shor’s algorithm (SICOMP 1997).  
 Our approach follows Bartusek and Malavolta (ITCS 2022), who obfuscate null  quantum circuits by obfuscating the verifier of an appropriate classical verification of quantum computation (CVQC) scheme. We go beyond null circuits by constructing a publicly-verifiable CVQC scheme for quantum partitioning  circuits, which can be used to verify the evaluation procedure of Mahadev’s quantum fully-homomorphic encryption scheme (FOCS 2018). We achieve this by upgrading the one-time secure scheme of Bartusek (TCC 2021) to a fully reusable scheme, via a publicly-decodable Pauli functional commitment  , which we formally define and construct in this work. This commitment scheme, which satisfies a notion of binding against committers that can access the receiver’s standard and Hadamard basis decoding functionalities, is constructed by building on techniques of Amos, Georgiou, Kiayias, and Zhandry (STOC 2020) introduced in the context of equivocal but collision-resistant hash functions.  

 Commitments to Quantum States   
 Sam Gunn 
  Nathan Ju 
  Fermi Ma 
  Mark Zhandry 
  What does it mean to commit to a quantum state? In this work, we propose a simple answer: a commitment to quantum messages is binding if, after the commit phase, the committed state is hidden from the sender's view. We accompany this new definition with several instantiations. We build the first non-interactive succinct quantum state commitments, which can be seen as an analogue of collision-resistant hashing for quantum messages. We also show that hiding quantum state commitments (QSCs) are implied by any commitment scheme for classical messages. All of our constructions can be based on quantum-cryptographic assumptions that are implied by but are potentially weaker than one-way functions.  
 Commitments to quantum states open the door to many new cryptographic possibilities. Our flagship application of a succinct QSC is a quantum-communication version of Kilian's succinct arguments for any language that has quantum PCPs with constant error and polylogarithmic locality. Plugging in the PCP theorem, this yields succinct arguments for NP under significantly weaker assumptions than required classically; moreover, if the quantum PCP conjecture holds, this extends to QMA. At the heart of our security proof is a new rewinding technique for extracting quantum information.  

 Quantum Cryptography in Algorithmica   
 William Kretschmer 
  Luowen Qian 
  Makrand Sinha 
  Avishay Tal 
  We construct a classical oracle relative to which P  = NP  yet single-copy secure pseudorandom quantum states exist. In the language of Impagliazzo’s five worlds, this is a construction of pseudorandom states in ”Algorithmica,” and hence shows that in a black-box setting, quantum cryptography based on pseudorandom states is possible even if one-way functions do not exist. As a consequence, we demonstrate that there exists a property of a cryptographic hash function that simultaneously (1) suffices to construct pseudorandom states, (2) holds for a random oracle, and (3) is independent of P  vs. NP  in the black-box setting. We also introduce a conjecture that would generalize our results to multi-copy secure pseudorandom states.  
 We build on the recent construction by Aaronson, Ingram, and Kretschmer (CCC 2022) of an oracle relative to which P  = NP  but BQP  ≠ QCMA  , based on hardness of the OR  ∘ Forrelation problem. Our proof also introduces a new discretely-defined variant of the Forrelation distribution, for which we prove pseudorandomness against AC  0  circuits. This variant may be of independent interest.  

 Quantum Free Games   
 Anand Natarajan 
  Tina Zhang 
  The complexity of free games with two or more classical players was essentially settled by Aaronson, Impagliazzo, and Moshkovitz (CCC’14). In the quantum world, there are two complexity classes that can be considered quantum analogues of classical free games: (1) AM  *  , the multiprover interactive proof class corresponding to free games with entangled players, and, somewhat less obviously, (2) BellQMA  (2), the class of quantum Merlin-Arthur proof systems with two unentangled Merlins, whose proof states are separately measured by Arthur. In this work, we make significant progress towards a tight characterization of both of these classes. (1) We show a BellQMA  (2) protocol for 3SAT on n  variables, where the total amount of communication is Õ(√ n  ). This answers an open question of Chen and Drucker (2010) and also shows, conditional on ETH, that the algorithm of Brandão, Christandl and Yard (STOC’11) for optimizing over separable states is tight up to logarithmic factors. (2) We show that AM  *  with n  provers  = 2, question length O  (1), and answer-length log( n  ) is equal to RE  , i.e. that free entangled games with constant-sized questions are as powerful as general entangled games. (In contrast, Aaronson, Impagliazzo and Moshkovitz show that classical free games are much weaker than general classical games.) We show this using a question “hyper-compression” theorem that iteratively applies the introspection technique of Ji et al. (2020). Our result is a significant improvement over the headline result of Ji et al., whose MIP  *  protocol for the halting problem has ( n  )-sized questions and answers. (3) By the same techniques, we obtain a zero-gap AM  *  protocol for a Π 2  complete language with constant-size questions and almost logarithmically ( O  (log n  · log *  n  )) large answers, improving on the headline result of Mousavi, Nezhadi and Yuen (STOC’22). (4) Using a connection to the nonuniform complexity of the halting problem we show that any MIP  *  protocol for RE  requires Ω(log n  ) bits of communication. It follows that our results in item 3 are optimal up to an O  (log *  n  ) factor, and that the gapless compression theorems of Mousavi, Nezhadi and Yuen are asymptotically optimal. We conjecture that these bounds can be saturated in the gapped case as well.  

 Quantum Advantage from Any Non-local Game   
 Yael Kalai 
  Alex Lombardi 
  Vinod Vaikuntanathan 
  Lisa Yang 
  We show a general method of compiling any k  -prover non-local game into a single-prover (computationally sound) interactive game maintaining the same quantum completeness and classical soundness guarantees, up to a negligible additive factor in a security parameter. Our compiler uses any quantum homomorphic encryption scheme (Mahadev, FOCS 2018; Brakerski, CRYPTO 2018) satisfying a natural form of correctness with respect to auxiliary quantum input. The homomorphic encryption scheme is used as a cryptographic mechanism to simulate the effect of spatial separation, and is required to evaluate k  −1 prover strategies out of k  on encrypted queries.  
 In conjunction with the rich literature on (entangled) multi-prover non-local games starting from the celebrated CHSH game (Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt, Physical Review Letters 1969), our compiler gives a broad and rich framework for constructing protocols that classically verify quantum advantage.  

 The Power of Unentangled Quantum Proofs with Non-negative Amplitudes   
 Fernando Granha Jeronimo 
  Pei Wu 
  Quantum entanglement is a fundamental property of quantum mechanics and it serves as a basic resource in quantum computation and information. Despite its importance, the power and limitations of quantum entanglement are far from being fully understood. Here, we study entanglement via the lens of computational complexity. This is done by studying quantum generalizations of the class NP with multiple unentangled  quantum proofs, the so-called QMA(2) and its variants. The complexity of QMA(2) is known to be closely connected to a variety of problems such as deciding if a state is entangled and several classical optimization problems. However, determining the complexity of QMA(2) is a longstanding open problem, and only the trivial complexity bounds ⊆ (2) ⊆ are known.  
 In this work, we study the power of unentangled  quantum proofs with non-negative  amplitudes, a class which we denote QMA +  (2). In this setting, we are able to design proof verification protocols for (increasingly) hard problems both using logarithmic  size quantum proofs and having a constant  probability gap in distinguishing yes from no instances. In particular, we design global  protocols for small set expansion (SSE), unique games (UG), and PCP verification. As a consequence, we obtain NP ⊆ QMA log  +  (2) with a constant gap. By virtue of the new constant  gap, we are able to “scale up” this result to QMA +  (2), obtaining the full characterization QMA +  (2)=NEXP by establishing stronger explicitness properties of the for . We believe that our protocols are interesting examples of proof verification and property testing in their own right. Moreover, each of our protocols has a single isolated property testing task relying on non-negative amplitudes which if generalized would allow transferring our results to QMA(2).  
 One key novelty of these protocols is the manipulation of quantum proofs in a global  and coherent  way yielding constant gaps. Previous protocols (only available for general amplitudes) are either local  having vanishingly small gaps or treating the quantum proofs as classical probability distributions requiring polynomially many proofs. In both cases, these known protocols do not imply non-trivial bounds on QMA(2).

 Testing Distributional Assumptions of Learning Algorithms   
 Ronitt Rubinfeld 
  Arsen Vasilyan 
  There are many important high dimensional  function classes that have fast agnostic learning algorithms when strong assumptions on the distribution of examples can be made, such as Gaussianity or uniformity over the domain. But how can one be sufficiently confident that the data indeed satisfies the distributional assumption, so that one can trust in the output quality of the agnostic learning algorithm? We propose a model by which to systematically study the design of tester-learner pairs  ( A  , T  ), such that if the distribution on examples in the data passes the tester T  then one can safely trust  the output of the agnostic learner A  on the data.  
 To demonstrate the power of the model, we apply it to the classical problem of agnostically learning halfspaces under the standard Gaussian distribution and present a tester-learner pair with a combined run-time of n  Õ(1/є 4  )  . This qualitatively matches that of the best known ordinary agnostic learning algorithms for this task. In contrast, finite sample Gaussian distribution testers do not exist for the L  1  and EMD distance measures. Previously it was known that half-spaces are well-approximated with low-degree polynomials relative to the Gaussian distribution. A key step in our analysis is showing that this is the case even relative to distributions whose low-degree moments approximately match those of a Gaussian.  
 We also go beyond spherically-symmetric distributions, and give a tester-learner pair for halfspaces under the uniform distribution on {0,1} n   with combined run-time of n  Õ(1/є 4  )  . This is achieved using polynomial approximation theory and critical index machinery of [Diakonikolas, Gopalan, Jaiswal, Servedio, and Viola 2009].  
 Can one design agnostic learning algorithms under distributional assumptions and count on future technical work to produce, as a matter of course, tester-learner pairs with similar run-time? Our answer is a resounding no, as we show there exist some well-studied settings for which 2 Õ(√ n  )  run-time agnostic learning algorithms are available, yet the combined run-times of tester-learner pairs must be as high as 2 Ω( n  )  . On that account, the design of tester-learner pairs is a research direction in its own right independent of standard agnostic learning. To be specific, our lower bounds apply to the problems of agnostically learning convex sets under the Gaussian distribution and for monotone Boolean functions under the uniform distribution over {0,1} n   .  

 A Moment-Matching Approach to Testable Learning and a New Characterization of Rademacher Complexity   
 Aravind Gollakota 
  Adam R. Klivans 
  Pravesh K. Kothari 
  A remarkable recent paper by Rubinfeld and Vasilyan (2022) initiated the study of testable learning  , where the goal is to replace hard-to-verify distributional assumptions (such as Gaussianity) with efficiently testable ones and to require that the learner succeed whenever the unknown distribution passes the corresponding test. In this model, they gave an efficient algorithm for learning halfspaces under testable assumptions that are provably satisfied by Gaussians.  
 In this paper we give a powerful new approach for developing algorithms for testable learning using tools from moment matching and metric distances in probability. We obtain efficient testable learners for any concept class that admits low-degree sandwiching polynomials  , capturing most important examples for which we have ordinary agnostic learners. We recover the results of Rubinfeld and Vasilyan as a corollary of our techniques while achieving improved, near-optimal sample complexity bounds for a broad range of concept classes and distributions.  
 Surprisingly, we show that the information-theoretic sample complexity of testable learning is tightly characterized by the Rademacher complexity of the concept class, one of the most well-studied measures in statistical learning theory. In particular, uniform convergence is necessary and sufficient for testable learning. This leads to a fundamental separation from (ordinary) distribution-specific agnostic learning, where uniform convergence is sufficient but not necessary.  

 Learning Polynomial Transformations via Generalized Tensor Decompositions   
 Sitan Chen 
  Jerry Li 
  Yuanzhi Li 
  Anru R. Zhang 
  We consider the problem of learning high dimensional polynomial transformations of Gaussians. Given samples of the form f  ( x  ), where x  ∼ N  (0, I  r   ) is hidden and f  : ℝ r   → ℝ d   is a function where every output coordinate is a low-degree polynomial, the goal is to learn the distribution over f  ( x  ). One can think of this as a simple model for learning deep generative models, namely pushforwards of Gaussians under two-layer neural networks with polynomial activations, though the learning problem is mathematically natural in its own right.  
 Our first main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for learning quadratic transformations of Gaussians in a smoothed setting. Our second main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for learning constant-degree polynomial transformations of Gaussian in a smoothed setting, when the rank of the associated tensors is small. In fact our results extend to any rotation-invariant input distribution, not just Gaussian. These are the first end-to-end guarantees for learning a pushforward under a neural network with more than one layer.  
 While our work aims to take an initial step towards understanding why generative models perform so well in practice, the algorithmic problems that we solve along the way are also of independent interest. We give the first provably efficient algorithms for tensor ring decomposition, a popular non-commutative generalization of tensor decomposition that is used in practice to implicitly store large tensors, as well as for a new variant of matrix factorization where the factors arise from low-rank tensors.  

 Average-Case Complexity of Tensor Decomposition for Low-Degree Polynomials   
 Alexander S. Wein 
  Suppose we are given an n  -dimensional order-3 symmetric tensor T  ∈ (ℝ n   ) ⊗ 3  that is the sum of r  random rank-1 terms. The problem of recovering the rank-1 components is possible in principle when r  ≲ n  2  but polynomial-time algorithms are only known in the regime r  ≪ n  3/2  . Similar “statistical-computational gaps” occur in many high-dimensional inference tasks, and in recent years there has been a flurry of work on explaining the apparent computational hardness in these problems by proving lower bounds against restricted (yet powerful) models of computation such as statistical queries (SQ), sum-of-squares (SoS), and low-degree polynomials (LDP). However, no such prior work exists for tensor decomposition, largely because its hardness does not appear to be explained by a “planted versus null” testing problem.  
 We consider a model for random order-3 tensor decomposition where one component is slightly larger in norm than the rest (to break symmetry), and the components are drawn uniformly from the hypercube. We resolve the computational complexity in the LDP model: O  (log n  )-degree polynomial functions of the tensor entries can accurately estimate the largest component when r  ≪ n  3/2  but fail to do so when r  ≫ n  3/2  . This provides rigorous evidence suggesting that the best known algorithms for tensor decomposition cannot be improved, at least by known approaches. A natural extension of the result holds for tensors of any fixed order k  ≥ 3, in which case the LDP threshold is r  ∼ n  k  /2  .  

 What Makes a Good Fisherman? Linear Regression under Self-Selection Bias   
 Yeshwanth Cherapanamjeri 
  Constantinos Daskalakis 
  Andrew Ilyas 
  Manolis Zampetakis 
  In the classical setting of self-selection, the goal is to learn k  models simultaneously, from observations ( x  ( i  )  , y  ( i  )  ) where y  ( i  )  is the output of one of k  underlying models on input x  ( i  )  . In contrast to mixture models, where we observe the output of a randomly selected model (and therefore the selection of which model is observed is exogenous  ), in self-selection models the observed model depends on the realized outputs of the underlying models themselves, as determined by some known selection criterion (e.g., we might observe the highest output, the smallest output, or the median output of the k  models), and is thus endogenous  . In known-index self-selection, the identity of the observed model output is observable; in unknown-index self-selection, it is not. Self-selection has a long history in Econometrics (going back to the works of Roy, Gronau, Lewis, Heckman, and others) and many applications in various theoretical and applied fields, including treatment effect estimation, imitation learning, learning from strategically reported data, and learning from markets at disequilibrium.  
 In this work, we present the first computationally and statistically efficient estimation algorithms for the most standard setting of this problem where the models are linear. In the known-index case, we require poly(1/ε, k  , d  ) sample and time complexity to estimate all model parameters to accuracy ε in d  dimensions, and can accommodate quite general selection criteria. In the more challenging unknown-index case, even the identifiability of the linear models (from infinitely many samples) was not known. We show three results in this case for the commonly studied max self-selection criterion: (1) we show that the linear models are indeed identifiable, (2) for general k  we provide an algorithm with poly( d  )· exp(poly( k  )) sample and time complexity to estimate the regression parameters up to error 1/poly( k  ), and (3) for k  = 2 we provide an algorithm for any error ε and poly( d  , 1/ε) sample and time complexity.  

 A Characterization of List Learnability   
 Moses Charikar 
  Chirag Pabbaraju 
  A classical result in learning theory shows the equivalence of PAC learnability of binary hypothesis classes and the finiteness of VC dimension. Extending this to the multiclass setting was an open problem, which was settled in a recent breakthrough result characterizing multiclass PAC learnability via the DS dimension introduced earlier by Daniely and Shalev-Shwartz.  
 In this work we consider list PAC learning where the goal is to output a list of k  predictions. List learning algorithms have been developed in several settings before and indeed, list learning played an important role in the recent characterization of multiclass learnability. In this work we ask: when is it possible to k  -list learn a hypothesis class?  
 We completely characterize k  -list learnability in terms of a generalization of DS dimension that we call the k  -DS dimension. Generalizing the recent characterization of multiclass learnability, we show that a hypothesis class is k  -list learnable if and only if the k  -DS dimension is finite.  

 A Unifying Theory of Distance from Calibration   
 Jarosław Błasiok 
  Parikshit Gopalan 
  Lunjia Hu 
  Preetum Nakkiran 
  We study the fundamental question of how to define and measure the distance from calibration for probabilistic predictors. While the notion of perfect calibration  is well-understood, there is no consensus on how to quantify the distance from perfect calibration. Numerous calibration measures have been proposed in the literature, but it is unclear how they compare to each other, and many popular measures such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) fail to satisfy basic properties like continuity.  
 We present a rigorous framework for analyzing calibration measures, inspired by the literature on property testing. We propose a ground-truth notion of distance from calibration: the ℓ 1  distance to the nearest perfectly calibrated predictor. We define a consistent calibration measure  as one that is polynomially related to this distance. Applying our framework, we identify three calibration measures that are consistent  and can be estimated efficiently: smooth calibration, interval calibration, and Laplace kernel calibration. The former two give quadratic approximations to the ground truth distance, which we show is information-theoretically optimal in a natural model for measuring calibration which we term the prediction-only access  model. Our work thus establishes fundamental lower and upper bounds on measuring the distance to calibration, and also provides theoretical justification for preferring certain metrics (like Laplace kernel calibration) in practice.  

 A Strongly Polynomial Algorithm for Approximate Forster Transforms and Its Application to Halfspace Learning   
 Ilias Diakonikolas 
  Christos Tzamos 
  Daniel M. Kane 
  The Forster transform is a method of regularizing a dataset by placing it in radial isotropic position  while maintaining some of its essential properties. Forster transforms have played a key role in a diverse range of settings spanning computer science and functional analysis. Prior work had given weakly  polynomial time algorithms for computing Forster transforms, when they exist. Our main result is the first strongly polynomial time  algorithm to compute an approximate Forster transform of a given dataset or certify that no such transformation exists. By leveraging our strongly polynomial Forster algorithm, we obtain the first strongly polynomial time algorithm for distribution-free  PAC learning of halfspaces. This learning result is surprising because proper  PAC learning of halfspaces is equivalent  to linear programming. Our learning approach extends to give a strongly polynomial halfspace learner in the presence of random classification noise and, more generally, Massart noise.  

 Lifting Uniform Learners via Distributional Decomposition   
 Guy Blanc 
  Jane Lange 
  Ali Malik 
  Li-Yang Tan 
  We show how any PAC learning algorithm that works under the uniform distribution can be transformed, in a blackbox fashion, into one that works under an arbitrary and unknown distribution ‍ D  . The efficiency of our transformation scales with the inherent complexity of ‍ D  , running in ( n  , ( md  ) d   ) time for distributions over n   whose pmfs are computed by depth- d  decision trees, where m  is the sample complexity of the original algorithm. For monotone distributions our transformation uses only samples from ‍ D  , and for general ones it uses subcube conditioning samples.  
 A key technical ingredient is an algorithm which, given the aforementioned access to D  , produces an optimal decision tree decomposition of D  : an approximation of D  as a mixture of uniform distributions over disjoint subcubes. With this decomposition in hand, we run the uniform-distribution learner on each subcube and combine the hypotheses using the decision tree. This algorithmic decomposition lemma also yields new algorithms for learning decision tree distributions with runtimes that exponentially improve on the prior state of the art—results of independent interest in distribution learning.  

 Hausdorff and Gromov-Hausdorff Stable Subsets of the Medial Axis   
 André Lieutier 
  Mathijs Wintraecken 
  In this paper we introduce a pruning of the medial axis called the (λ,α)-medial axis (ax λ  α  ). We prove that the (λ,α)-medial axis of a set K  is stable in a Gromov-Hausdorff sense under weak assumptions. More formally we prove that if K  and K  ′ are close in the Hausdorff ( d  H   ) sense then the (λ,α)-medial axes of K  and K  ′ are close as metric spaces, that is the Gromov-Hausdorff distance ( d  GH   ) between the two is 1/4-Hölder in the sense that d  GH   (ax λ  α  ( K  ),ax λ  α  ( K  ′)) ≲ d  H   ( K  , K  ′) 1/4  . The Hausdorff distance between the two medial axes is also bounded, by d  H   (ax λ  α  ( K  ), λ  α  ( K  ′)) ≲ d  H   ( K  , K  ′) 1/2  . These quantified stability results provide guarantees for practical computations of medial axes from approximations. Moreover, they provide key ingredients for studying the computability of the medial axis in the context of computable analysis.

 Faster Deterministic Distributed MIS and Approximate Matching   
 Mohsen Ghaffari 
  Christoph Grunau 
  We present an Õ(log 2  n  ) round deterministic distributed algorithm for the maximal independent set problem. By known reductions, this round complexity extends also to maximal matching, Δ+1 vertex coloring, and 2Δ−1 edge coloring. These four problems are among the most central problems in distributed graph algorithms and have been studied extensively for the past four decades. This improved round complexity comes closer to the Ω(log n  ) lower bound of maximal independent set and maximal matching [Balliu et al. FOCS ’19]. The previous best known deterministic complexity for all of these problems was Θ(log 3  n  ). Via the shattering technique, the improvement permeates also to the corresponding randomized complexities, e.g., the new randomized complexity of Δ+1 vertex coloring is now Õ(log 2  log n  ) rounds.  
 Our approach is a novel combination of the previously known (and seemingly orthogonal) two methods for developing fast deterministic algorithms for these problems, namely global derandomization via network decomposition  (see e.g., [Rozhon, Ghaffari STOC’20; Ghaffari, Grunau, Rozhon SODA’21; Ghaffari et al. SODA’23]) and local rounding of fractional solutions  (see e.g., [Fischer DISC’17; Harris FOCS’19; Fischer, Ghaffari, Kuhn FOCS’17; Ghaffari, Kuhn FOCS’21; Faour et al. SODA’23]). We consider a relaxation of the classic network decomposition concept, where instead of requiring the clusters in the same block to be non-adjacent, we allow each node to have a small number of neighboring clusters. We also show a deterministic algorithm that computes this relaxed decomposition faster than standard decompositions. We then use this relaxed decomposition to significantly improve the integrality of certain fractional solutions, before handing them to the local rounding procedure that now has to do fewer rounding steps.  

 Finding a Small Vertex Cut on Distributed Networks   
 Yonggang Jiang 
  Sagnik Mukhopadhyay 
  We present an algorithm for distributed networks to efficiently find a small vertex cut in the CONGEST model. Given a positive integer κ, our algorithm can, with high probability, either find κ vertices whose removal disconnects the network or return that such κ vertices do not exist. Our algorithm takes κ 3  · Õ( D  +√ n  ) rounds, where n  is the number of vertices in the network and D  denotes the network’s diameter. This implies Õ( D  +√ n  ) round complexity whenever κ=polylog( n  ).  
 Prior to our result, a bound of Õ( D  ) is known only when κ=1,2 [Parter, Petruschka DISC’22]. For κ≥ 3, this bound can be obtained only by an O  (log n  )-approximation algorithm [Censor-Hillel, Ghaffari, Kuhn PODC’14], and the only known exact algorithm takes O  ((κΔ D  ) O  (κ)  ) rounds, where Δ is the maximum degree [Parter DISC’19]. Our result answers an open problem by Nanongkai, Saranurak, and Yingchareonthawornchai [STOC’19].  

 New Subset Selection Algorithms for Low Rank Approximation: Offline and Online   
 David P. Woodruff 
  Taisuke Yasuda 
  Subset selection for the rank k  approximation of an n  × d  matrix A  offers improvements in the interpretability of matrices, as well as a variety of computational savings. This problem is well-understood when the error measure is the Frobenius norm, with various tight algorithms known even in challenging models such as the online model, where an algorithm must select the column subset irrevocably when the columns arrive one by one. In sharp contrast, when the error measure is replaced by other matrix losses, optimal trade-offs between the subset size and approximation quality have not been settled, even in the standard offline setting. We give a number of results towards closing these gaps.  
 In the offline setting, we achieve nearly optimal bicriteria algorithms in two settings. First, we remove a √ k  factor from a prior result of Song–Woodruff–Zhong when the loss function is any entrywise loss with an approximate triangle inequality and at least linear growth, which includes, e.g., the Huber loss. Our result is tight when applied to the ℓ 1  loss. We give a similar improvement for the entrywise ℓ p   loss for p  >2, improving a previous distortion of Õ( k  1−1/ p   ) to O  ( k  1/2−1/ p   ). We show this is tight for p  = ∞, while for 2< p  <∞, we give the first bicriteria algorithms for (1+ε)-approximate entrywise ℓ p   low rank approximation. Our results come from a general technique which improves distortions by replacing the use of a well-conditioned basis with a slightly larger spanning set for which any vector can be expressed as a linear combination with small Euclidean norm. This idea may be of independent interest and we show, for example, that it also gives the first oblivious ℓ p   subspace embeddings for 1≤ p  < 2 with Õ( d  1/ p   ) distortion, which is nearly optimal and improves the previously best known Õ( d  ) and closes a long line of work.  
 In the online setting, we give the first online subset selection algorithm for ℓ p   subspace approximation and entrywise ℓ p   low rank approximation by showing how to implement the classical sensitivity sampling algorithm online, which is challenging due to the sequential nature of sensitivity sampling. Our main technique is an online algorithm for detecting when an approximately optimal subspace changes substantially. We also give new related results for the online setting, including online coresets for Euclidean ( k  , p  ) clustering as well as an online active regression algorithm making Θ( d  p  /2  /ε p  −1  ) queries, answering open questions of Musco–Musco–Woodruff–Yasuda and Chen–Li–Sun.  

 Resolving Matrix Spencer Conjecture Up to Poly-logarithmic Rank   
 Nikhil Bansal 
  Haotian Jiang 
  Raghu Meka 
  We give a simple proof of the matrix Spencer conjecture up to poly-logarithmic rank: given symmetric d  × d  matrices A  1  ,…, A  n   each with || A  i   || op   ≤ 1 and rank at most n  /log 3  n  , one can efficiently find ± 1 signs x  1  ,…, x  n   such that their signed sum has spectral norm ||∑ i  =1  n   x  i   A  i   || op   = O  (√ n  ). This result also implies a log n  − Ω( loglog n  ) qubit lower bound for quantum random access codes encoding n  classical bits with advantage ≫ 1/√ n  .  
 Our proof uses the recent refinement of the non-commutative Khintchine inequality in [Bandeira, Boedihardjo, van Handel, 2021] for random matrices with correlated Gaussian entries.

 A (1.5+ε)-Approximation Algorithm for Weighted Connectivity Augmentation   
 Vera Traub 
  Rico Zenklusen 
  Connectivity augmentation problems are among the most elementary questions in Network Design. Many of these problems admit natural 2-approximation algorithms, often through various classic techniques, whereas it remains open whether approximation factors below 2 can be achieved. One of the most basic examples thereof is the Weighted Connectivity Augmentation Problem (WCAP). In WCAP, one is given an undirected graph together with a set of additional weighted candidate edges, and the task is to find a cheapest set of candidate edges whose addition to the graph increases its edge-connectivity. We present a (1.5+ε)-approximation algorithm for WCAP, showing for the first time that factors below 2 are achievable.  
 On a high level, we design a well-chosen local search algorithm, inspired by recent advances for Weighted Tree Augmentation. To measure progress, we consider a directed weakening of WCAP and show that it has highly structured planar solutions. Interpreting a solution of the original problem as one of this directed weakening allows us to describe local exchange steps in a clean and algorithmically amenable way. Leveraging these insights, we show that we can efficiently search for good exchange steps within a component class of link sets that is closely related to bounded treewidth subgraphs of circle graphs. Moreover, we prove that an optimum solution can be decomposed into smaller components, at least one of which leads to a good local search step as long as we did not yet achieve the claimed approximation guarantee.  

 Cheeger Inequalities for Directed Graphs and Hypergraphs using Reweighted Eigenvalues   
 Lap Chi Lau 
  Kam Chuen Tung 
  Robert Wang 
  We derive Cheeger inequalities for directed graphs and hypergraphs using the reweighted eigenvalue approach that was recently developed for vertex expansion in undirected graphs. The goal is to develop a new spectral theory for directed graphs and an alternative spectral theory for hypergraphs.  
 The first main result is a Cheeger inequality relating the vertex expansion of a directed graph to the vertex-capacitated maximum reweighted second eigenvalue. This provides a combinatorial characterization of the fastest mixing time of a directed graph by vertex expansion, and builds a new connection between reweighted eigenvalued, vertex expansion, and fastest mixing time for directed graphs.  
 The second main result is a stronger Cheeger inequality relating the edge conductance of a directed graph to the edge-capacitated maximum reweighted second eigenvalue. This provides a certificate for a directed graph to be an expander and a spectral algorithm to find a sparse cut in a directed graph, playing a similar role as Cheeger's inequality in certifying graph expansion and in the spectral partitioning algorithm for undirected graphs.  
 We also use this reweighted eigenvalue approach to derive the improved Cheeger inequality for directed graphs, and furthermore to derive several Cheeger inequalities for hypergraphs that match and improve the existing results. These are supporting results that this provides a unifying approach to lift the spectral theory for undirected graphs to more general settings.  

 An Improved Approximation Guarantee for Prize-Collecting TSP   
 Jannis Blauth 
  Martin Nägele 
  We present a new approximation algorithm for the (metric) prize-collecting traveling salesperson problem (PCTSP). In PCTSP, opposed to the classical traveling salesperson problem (TSP), one may choose to not include a vertex of the input graph in the returned tour at the cost of a given vertex-dependent penalty, and the objective is to balance the length of the tour and the incurred penalties for omitted vertices by minimizing the sum of the two. We present an algorithm that achieves an approximation guarantee of 1.774 with respect to the natural linear programming relaxation of the problem. This significantly reduces the gap between the approximability of classical TSP and PCTSP, beating the previously best known approximation factor of 1.915. As a key ingredient of our improvement, we present a refined decomposition technique for solutions of the LP relaxation, and show how to leverage components of that decomposition as building blocks for our tours.  

 Better Trees for Santa Claus   
 Étienne Bamas 
  Lars Rohwedder 
  We revisit the problem max-min degree arborescence, which was introduced by Bateni et al. [STOC’09] as a central special case of the general Santa Claus problem, which constitutes a notorious open question in approximation algorithms. In the former problem we are given a directed graph with sources and sinks and our goal is to find vertex disjoint arborescences rooted in the sources such that at each non-sink vertex of an arborescence the out-degree is at least k  , where k  is to be maximized. This problem is of particular interest, since it appears to capture much of the difficulty of the Santa Claus problem: (1) like in the Santa Claus problem the configuration LP has a large integrality gap in this case and (2) previous progress by Bateni et al. was quickly generalized to the Santa Claus problem (Chakrabarty et al. [FOCS’09]). These results remain the state-of-the-art both for the Santa Claus problem and for max-min degree arborescence and they yield a polylogarithmic approximation in quasi-polynomial time. We present an exponential improvement to this, a poly  (loglog n  )-approximation in quasi-polynomial time for the max-min degree arborescence problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of breaking the logarithmic barrier for a special case of the Santa Claus problem, where the configuration LP cannot be utilized. The main technical novelty of our result are locally good solutions: informally, we show that it suffices to find a poly  (log n  )-approximation that locally has stronger guarantees. We use a lift-and-project type of LP and randomized rounding, which were also used by Bateni et al., but unlike previous work we integrate careful pruning steps in the rounding. In the proof we extensively apply Lovász Local Lemma and a local search technique, both of which were previously used only in the context of the configuration LP.  

 SESSION: Session 10C  
 Interior Point Methods with a Gradient Oracle   
 Adrian Vladu 
  We provide an interior point method based on quasi-Newton iterations, which only requires first-order access to a strongly self-concordant barrier function. To achieve this, we extend the techniques of Dunagan-Harvey [STOC ’07] to maintain a preconditioner, while using only first-order information. We measure the quality of this preconditioner in terms of its relative excentricity to the unknown Hessian matrix, and we generalize these techniques to convex functions with a slowly-changing Hessian. We combine this with an interior point method to show that, given first-order access to an appropriate barrier function for a convex set K  , we can solve well-conditioned linear optimization problems over K  to ε precision in time O  (( T  + n  2  )√ n  νlog(1/ε)), where ν is the self-concordance parameter of the barrier function, and T  is the time required to make a gradient query.  
 As a consequence we show that:  
 Linear optimization over n  -dimensional convex sets can be solved in time O  (( T  n  + n  3  )log(1/ε)). This parallels the running time achieved by state of the art algorithms for cutting plane methods, when replacing separation oracles with first-order oracles for an appropriate barrier function. We can solve semidefinite programs involving m  ≥ n  matrices in ℝ n  × n   in time O  ( mn  4  + m  1.25  n  3.5  log(1/ε)), improving over the state of the art algorithms, in the case where m  =Ω( n  3.5/ω−1.25  ).  
 Along the way we develop a host of tools allowing us to control the evolution of our potential functions, using techniques from matrix analysis and Schur convexity.  

 The Smoothed Complexity of Policy Iteration for Markov Decision Processes   
 Miranda Christ 
  Mihalis Yannakakis 
  We show subexponential lower bounds (i.e., 2 Ω ( n  c   )  ) on the smoothed complexity of the classical Howard’s Policy Iteration algorithm for Markov Decision Processes. The bounds hold for the total reward and the average reward criteria. The constructions are robust in the sense that the subexponential bound holds not only on the average for independent random perturbations of the MDP parameters (transition probabilities and rewards), but for all arbitrary perturbations within an inverse polynomial range. We show also an exponential lower bound on the worst-case complexity for the simple reachability objective.  

 Upper and Lower Bounds on the Smoothed Complexity of the Simplex Method   
 Sophie Huiberts 
  Yin Tat Lee 
  Xinzhi Zhang 
  The simplex method for linear programming is known to be highly efficient in practice, and understanding its performance from a theoretical perspective is an active research topic. The framework of smoothed analysis, first introduced by Spielman and Teng (JACM ’04) for this purpose, defines the smoothed complexity of solving a linear program with d  variables and n  constraints as the expected running time when Gaussian noise of variance σ 2  is added to the LP data. We prove that the smoothed complexity of the simplex method is O  (σ −3/2  d  13/4  log 7/4  n  ), improving the dependence on 1/σ compared to the previous bound of O  (σ −2  d  2  √log n  ). We accomplish this through a new analysis of the shadow bound  , key to earlier analyses as well. Illustrating the power of our new method, we use our method to prove a nearly tight upper bound on the smoothed complexity of two-dimensional polygons.  

 Algorithms Approaching the Threshold for Semi-random Planted Clique   
 Rares-Darius Buhai 
  Pravesh K. Kothari 
  David Steurer 
  We design new polynomial-time algorithms for recovering planted cliques in the semi-random graph model introduced by Feige and Kilian. The previous best algorithms for this model succeed if the planted clique has size at least n  2/3  in a graph with n  vertices. Our algorithms work for planted-clique sizes approaching n  1/2  — the information-theoretic threshold in the semi-random model and a conjectured computational threshold even in the easier fully-random model. This result comes close to resolving open questions by Feige and Steinhardt.  
 To generate a graph in the semi-random planted-clique model, we first 1) plant a clique of size k  in an n  -vertex –graph with edge probability 1/2 and then adversarially add or delete an arbitrary number edges not touching the planted clique and delete any subset of edges going out of the planted clique. For every є>0, we give an n  O  (1/є)  -time algorithm that recovers a clique of size k  in this model whenever k  ≥ n  1/2+є  . In fact, our algorithm computes, with high probability, a list of about n  / k  cliques of size k  that contains the planted clique. Our algorithms also extend to arbitrary edge probabilities p  and improve on the previous best guarantee whenever p  ≤ 1− n  −0.001  .  
 Our algorithms rely on a new conceptual connection that translates certificates of upper bounds on biclique numbers in unbalanced  bipartite –random graphs into algorithms for semi-random planted clique. Analogous to the (conjecturally) optimal algorithms for the fully-random model, the previous best guarantees for semi-random planted clique correspond to spectral relaxations of biclique numbers based on eigenvalues of adjacency matrices. We construct an SDP lower bound that shows that the n  2/3  threshold in prior works is an inherent limitation of these spectral relaxations. We go beyond this limitation by using higher-order sum-of-squares relaxations for biclique numbers.  
 We also provide some evidence that the information-computation trade-off of our current algorithms may be inherent by proving an average-case lower bound for unbalanced bicliques in the low-degree polynomial model.

 Call for Papers  
 The 22nd ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks (HotNets 2023) will bring together researchers in computer networks and systems to engage in a lively debate on the theory and practice of computer networking. HotNets provides a venue for discussing innovative ideas and for debating future research agendas in networking.  
 We invite researchers and practitioners to submit short position papers. We encourage papers that identify fundamental open questions, advocate a new approach, offer a constructive critique of the state of networking research, re-frame or debunk existing work, report unexpected early results from a deployment, report on promising but unproven ideas, or propose new evaluation methods. Novel ideas need not be supported by full evaluations; well-reasoned arguments or preliminary evaluations can support the possibility of the paper’s claims.  
 We seek early-stage work, where the authors can benefit from community feedback. An ideal submission has the potential to open a line of inquiry for the community that results in multiple conference papers in related venues (SIGCOMM, NSDI, CoNEXT, SOSP, OSDI, MobiCom, MobiSys, etc.), rather than a single follow-on conference paper. We strongly discourage “conference papers in the miniature”, and the program committee will explicitly favor early work and papers likely to stimulate reflection and discussion over something that is ready for publication at a conference. Finished work that fits in a short paper is likely a better fit with the short-paper tracks at either CoNEXT or IMC, for example.  
 HotNets takes a broad view of networking research. This includes new ideas relating to (but not limited to) mobile, wide-area, data-center, home, and enterprise networks using a variety of link technologies (e.g. wired, wireless, optical, visual, and acoustic), as well as social networks and network architecture. It encompasses all aspects of networks, including (but not limited to) packet-processing and transmission hardware and software, virtualization, mobility, provisioning and resource management, performance, energy consumption, sustainability, topology, robustness and security, measurement, diagnosis, verification, privacy, economics and evolution, interactions with applications, interactions between machine learning and networking, and usability of underlying networking technologies.  
 Position papers will be selected based on originality, likelihood of stimulating insightful discussion at the workshop, and technical merit. Accepted papers will be posted online prior to the workshop and will be published in the ACM Digital Library to facilitate wide dissemination of the ideas discussed at the workshop.  
 Policy on Concurrent Submissions  
 Concurrent submissions to HotNets 2023 and any other peer-reviewed venue that cover the same work (differences in the degree of detail given the two venues’ length limits notwithstanding) are prohibited, and will result in the immediate rejection of the HotNets submission in question. “Concurrent” means any other peer-reviewed venue whose reviewing period (i.e., between submission and notification) overlaps with that of HotNets. The “same work” means, for example, a submission overlapping significantly in content with a conference submission. However, a position paper submitted to HotNets (e.g., that reflects broadly on the state of some aspect of the field, adopts a position as to how the field should move forward, or articulates a broad avenue of future work) will not be considered the “same work” as a conference-length paper on a specific system that addresses a point under the broad umbrella covered by the position paper. Authors with questions about the concurrent submission policy are encouraged to contact the PC chairs (Hitesh and Panda) prior to submitting.  
 Ethical Concerns  
 As part of the submission process, authors must attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of their home institution(s), including, but not limited to privacy policies and policies on experiments involving humans. Note that submitting research for approval by one’s institution’s ethics review body is necessary, but not sufficient – in cases where the PC has concerns about the ethics of the work in a submission, the PC will have its own discussion of the ethics of that work. The PC takes a broad view of what constitutes an ethical concern, and authors agree to be available at any time during the review process to rapidly respond to queries from the PC chairs regarding ethical standards.  
 Workshop Participation  
 HotNets attendance is limited to roughly 90 people in person to facilitate a lively discussion (potentially with additional virtual participants). In-person invitations will be allocated first to one author of each paper, HotNets organizers and committee members, and conference sponsors. We require the paper presentations to be in-person (if authors have any concerns about this, they are welcome to contact the PC chairs). To promote an inclusive workshop, HotNets will also make a limited number of open registration slots for in-person attendance available to the community.  
 Submission and Formatting  
 Submitted papers must be no longer than 6 pages (10 point font, 12 point leading, 7 inch by 9.25 inch text block) including all content except references (appendices are not allowed). There are no limits for reference pages. This archive  contains a LaTeX class file that follows the prescribed submission format and an example of a paper formatted using that class.  
 All submissions must be blind: they must not indicate the names or affiliations of the authors in the paper. Only electronic submissions in PDF will be accepted. Submissions must be written in English, render without error using standard tools (e.g., Acrobat Reader), and print on US Letter paper. Papers must contain novel ideas and must differ significantly in content from previously published papers.  
 Submit papers on the HotCRP  .  
 Important Dates  
  
 Paper submission deadline: | Friday June 30, 2023 (5:59:59 pm EDT) 
 Acceptance/rejection notification: | September 15, 2023

 PLDI 2023  
   
 PLDI echoes FCRC  ’s statement regarding recent legislation in Florida. Anyone, from any background, should feel encouraged to participate and contribute to PLDI. Differences – in age, race, gender and sexual orientation, nationality, physical ability, thinking style and experience – bring richness to our efforts in providing quality programs and services for the global computing community. Thus, PLDI is committed to creating an environment that welcomes new ideas and perspectives, and where hostility or other antisocial behaviors are not tolerated.   
  Welcome to the home page of the 44th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI 2023)!  
 PLDI is the premier forum in the field of programming languages and programming systems research, covering the areas of design, implementation, theory, applications, and performance.  
 PLDI’23 will held in-person as part of FCRC’23  , sharing the venue and activities with ten other top computer science conferences.  
 Free Virtual Attendance   
 We’re sorry that not all can attend the conference in Florida, whether due to recent laws passed in Florida, the difficulty many face in getting US visas, or the substantial cost involved in attending such a conference. However, we are very proud to provide free and open virtual access to the conference for all  , with talks streamed and PLDI papers available via open access.

 Time Band   
   
 By setting a time band, the program will dim events that are outside this time window. This is useful for (virtual) conferences with a continuous program (with repeated sessions).  
  The time band will also limit the events that are included in the personal iCalendar subscription service.   Display full program    Specify a time band   -

 POPL 2023 Call for Papers  
  
 PACMPL Issue POPL 2023 seeks contributions on all aspects of programming languages and programming systems, both theoretical and practical. Authors of papers published in PACMPL Issue POPL 2023 will be invited to present their work in the POPL conference in January 2023, which is sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN, in cooperation with ACM SIGACT and ACM SIGLOG.  
 Scope   
 Principles of Programming Languages (POPL) is a forum for the discussion of all aspects of programming languages and programming systems. Both theoretical and experimental papers are welcome, on topics ranging from formal frameworks to experience reports. We seek submissions that make principled, enduring contributions to the theory, design, understanding, implementation, or application of programming languages.  
 Evaluation Criteria   
 The Review Committee will evaluate the technical contribution of each submission as well as its accessibility to both experts and the general POPL audience. All papers will be judged on significance, originality, relevance, correctness, and clarity. Each paper must explain its scientific contribution in both general and technical terms, identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant, and comparing it with previous work. Advice on writing technical papers can be found on the SIGPLAN author information page  .  
 Deadlines and formatting requirements, detailed below, will be strictly enforced.  
 Evaluation Process   
 NEW THIS YEAR  : POPL 2023 will use a double-blind reviewing process (instead of the lightweight double-blind process used in recent years). This means that identities of authors will not be visible to reviewers until after conditional-acceptance decisions have been made. For authors, the main change is that there is no option to upload non-anonymized  supplementary material; only anonymized  supplementary material may be submitted  .  
 Also new this year: POPL 2023 will have three Associate Chairs who will help the PC Chair monitor reviews, solicit external expert reviews for submissions when there is not enough expertise on the committee, and facilitate reviewer discussions.  
 As in previous years, authors will have a multi-day period to respond to reviews, as indicated in the Important Dates table. Responses are optional. A response must be concise, addressing specific points raised in the reviews; in particular, it must not introduce new technical results. Reviewers will write a short reaction to these author responses.  
 The Review Committee (RC) will discuss papers electronically and, new this year, also during two days of synchronous, face-to-face, virtual Review Committee meetings. There will be no physical RC meeting; this will avoid the time, cost, and environmental impact of transporting an increasingly large committee to one point on the globe. There is no formal External Review Committee, though experts outside the committee will be consulted. Reviews will be accompanied by a short summary of the reasons behind the committee’s decision with the goal of clarifying the reasons behind the decision.  
 To conform with ACM requirements for journal publication, all POPL papers will be conditionally accepted; authors will be required to submit a short description of the changes made to the final version of the paper, including how the changes address any requirements imposed by the Review Committee. That the changes are sufficient will be confirmed by the original reviewers prior to acceptance to POPL. Authors of conditionally accepted papers must submit a satisfactory revision to the Review Committee by the requested deadline or risk rejection.  
 For additional information about the reviewing process, see: Principles of POPL  , a presentation of the underlying organizational and reviewing policies for POPL. For POPL 2023, policies specified in this Call for Papers supersede those in the Principles of POPL document.  
 Double-Blind Reviewing   
 POPL 2023 will use double-blind reviewing. This means that author names and affiliations must be omitted from the submission. Additionally, if the submission refers to prior work done by the authors, that reference should be made in third person. These are firm submission requirements. Any supplementary material must also be anonymized.  
 The FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing  clarifies the policy for the most common scenarios. But there are many gray areas and trade-offs. If you have any doubts about how to interpret the double-blind rules, please contact the Program Chair. Make sure to contact the Program Chair for complex cases that are not fully covered by the FAQ.  
 Submission Site Information   
 The submission site is https://popl23.hotcrp.com  .  
 Authors can submit multiple times prior to the deadline. Only the last submission will be reviewed. There is no abstract deadline. The submission site requires entering author names and affiliations, relevant topics, and potential conflicts. Addition or removal of authors after the submission deadline will need to be approved by the Program Chair (as this kind of change potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts during paper assignment).  
 The submission deadline is 11:59PM July 7, 2022 anywhere on earth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth   
 Conflicts of Interest   
 Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc; forever), between an author and a co-author (papers and proposals; for two years), between people at the same institution (branches of large companies or different locations of research institutes are considered to be the same institution; for two years after leaving an institution), between people with financial conflicts of interest, and between friends or relatives.  
 Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are especially harmful if the aim is to exclude potential reviewers, so spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about a conflict, please consult the Program Chair.  
 Submission Guidelines   
 The following two points should not be overlooked:  
 Conflicts | : For each submission, the authors must make sure that they properly declare all potential conflicts of interest for all of the authors of that submission. This includes marking PC conflicts as well as “Other Conflicts (external)”. A conflict caught late in the reviewing process leads to a voided review which may be infeasible to replace. 
  Anonymity | : POPL 2023 will employ a double-blind reviewing process. Make sure that your submitted paper is fully anonymized. 
  Prior to the paper submission deadline, the authors will upload their full anonymized paper. Each paper should have no more than 25 pages of text, excluding bibliography  , using the ACM Proceedings format. This format is chosen for compatibility with PACMPL. It is a single-column page layout with a 10 pt font, 12 pt line spacing, and wider margins than recent POPL page layouts. In this format, the main text block is 5.478 in (13.91 cm) wide and 7.884 in (20.03 cm) tall. Use of a different format (e.g., smaller fonts or a larger text block) is grounds for summary rejection. PACMPL templates for Microsoft Word and LaTeX can be found at the SIGPLAN author information page  . In particular, authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall option. We also strongly encourage the review and screen options. Submissions may use numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers must use author-year format for citations. Submissions should be in PDF and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper. Papers may be resubmitted to the submission site multiple times up until the deadline, but the last version submitted before the deadline will be the version reviewed. Papers that exceed the length requirement, that deviate from the expected format, or that are submitted late will be rejected.  
 Submitted papers must adhere to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy  and the ACM Policy on Plagiarism  . Concurrent submissions to other conferences, workshops, journals, or similar forums of publication are not allowed.  
 POPL 2023 will employ a double-blind reviewing process. To facilitate this, submitted papers must adhere to two rules:  
 author names and institutions must be omitted, and 
  references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). 
  The purpose of this process is to help the Review Committee and external reviewers come to a judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important background references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors may disseminate their ideas and post draft versions of their paper on their webpage, but should not take steps that would almost certainly reveal their identities to members of the Review Committee, e.g., directly contacting RC members or publicizing the work on social media or major mailing lists used by the community. The FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing  clarifies the policy for many common concerns.  
 The submission itself is the object of review, so it should strive to convince the reader of at least the plausibility of reported results. Still, we encourage authors to provide any supplementary material that is required to support the claims made in the paper, such as detailed proofs, proof scripts, or experimental data. These materials must be uploaded at submission time, as a single pdf or a tarball, not via a URL. All supplementary material should be anonymized. Reviewers are under no obligation to look at the supplementary material but may refer to it if they have questions about the material in the body of the paper.  
 Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers   
 Authors of conditionally accepted papers will be invited to formally submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Artifact submission is strongly encouraged but voluntary and will not influence the final decision regarding the papers. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings, by including them as “source materials” in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Copyright, Publication, and Presentation   
 As a Gold Open Access journal, PACMPL is committed to making peer-reviewed scientific research free of restrictions on both access and (re-)use. Authors are strongly encouraged to support libre open access by licensing their work with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) license  , which grants readers liberal (re-)use rights.  
 Authors of accepted papers will be required to choose one of the following publication rights:  
 Author licenses the work with a | Creative Commons license | , retains copyright, and (implicitly) grants ACM non-exclusive permission to publish (suggested choice). 
  Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive permission to publish license. 
  Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive permission to publish license. 
  Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM. 
  These choices follow from ACM Copyright Policy and ACM Author Rights, corresponding to ACM’s “author pays” option. While PACMPL may ask authors who have funding for open-access fees to voluntarily cover the article processing charge (currently, US$400), payment is not required for publication. PACMPL and SIGPLAN continue to explore the best models for funding open access, focusing on approaches that are sustainable in the long-term while reducing short-term risk.  
 All papers will be archived by the ACM Digital Library. Authors will have the option of including supplementary material with their paper. The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 Authors of accepted papers are required to give a short talk (roughly 25 minutes long) at the conference, according to the conference schedule.  
 Distinguished Paper Awards   
 At most 10% of the accepted papers of POPL 2023 will be designated as Distinguished Papers. This award highlights papers that the Review Committee thinks should be read by a broad audience due to their relevance, originality, significance, and clarity. The selection of the distinguished papers will be made based on the final version of the paper and through a second review process.  

 FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing  
   
 General   
 Q: Why are you using double-blind reviewing?   
 A: Studies have shown that a reviewer’s attitude toward a submission may be affected, even unconsciously, by the identity of the authors. We want reviewers to be able to approach each submission without any such, possibly involuntary, pre-judgment. Many computer science conferences have embraced double-blind reviewing. POPL has used lightweight double-blind reviewing for several years now as stipulated in the Principles of POPL  .  
 Q: Do you really think blinding actually works? I suspect reviewers can often guess who the authors are anyway.   
 A: It is rare for authorship to be guessed correctly, even by expert reviewers, as detailed in this study  .  
 Q: Couldn’t blind submission create an injustice where a paper is inappropriately rejected based upon supposedly-prior work which was actually by the same authors and not previously published?   
 A: Reviewers are held accountable for their positions and are required to identify any supposed prior work that they believe undermines the novelty of the paper. Any assertion that “this has been done before” by reviewers should be supported with concrete information. The author response mechanism exists in part to hold reviewers accountable for claims that may be incorrect.  
 For authors   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 A: Use common sense. Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are. The specific guidelines stated in the call for papers are simple: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on amphibious type systems, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on statically typed toads [Smith 2004],” you might say “We extend Smith’s [2004] earlier work on statically typed toads.” Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity. In general, you should aim to reduce the risk of accidental unblinding. For example, if your paper is the first to describe a system with a well-known name or codename, or you use a personally-identifiable naming convention for your work, then use a different name for your submission (which you may indicate has been changed for the purposes of double-blind reviewing). You should also avoid revealing the institutional affiliation of authors or at which the work was performed.  
 Q: I would like to provide supplementary material for consideration, e.g., the code of my implementation or proofs of theorems. How do I do this?   
 A (and also see the next question): On the submission site there will be an option to submit supplementary material along with your main paper. This supplementary material should also be anonymized; it may be viewed by reviewers during the review period, so it should adhere to the same double-blind guidelines. e discourage authors from providing supplementary materials via links to external web sites. It is possible to change the linked items after the submission deadline has passed, and, to be fair to all authors, we would like to be sure reviewers evaluate materials that have been completed prior to the submission deadline. Having said that, it is appropriate to link to items, such as an online demo, that can’t easily be submitted. Needless to say, attempting to discover the reviewers for your paper by tracking visitors to such a demo site would be a breach of academic integrity. Supplementary items such as PDFs should always be uploaded to HotCRP.  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository or I would like to provide a link to an online demo. How do I deal with this?   
 A: Making your code publicly available is not incompatible with double-blind reviewing. You should do the following. First, cite the code in your paper, but remove the actual URL and, instead say “link to repository removed for double-blind review” or similar. Second, if, when writing your author response, you believe reviewer access to your code would help, say so in your author response (without providing the URL), and send the URL to the Program Chair. The same policy applies if you wish to provide a link to an online demo that can’t easily be submitted as supplementary material.  
 Q: I am building on my own past work on the WizWoz system. Do I need to rename this system in my paper for purposes of anonymity, so as to remove the implied connection between my authorship of past work on this system and my present submission?   
 A: No. The relationship between systems and authors changes over time, so there will be at least some doubt about authorship. Increasing this doubt by changing the system name would help with anonymity, but it would compromise the research process. In particular, changing the name requires explaining a lot about the system again because you can’t just refer to the existing papers, which use the proper name. Not citing these papers runs the risk of the reviewers who know about the existing system thinking you are replicating earlier work. It is also confusing for the reviewers to read about the paper under Name X and then have the name be changed to Name Y. Will all the reviewers go and re-read the final version with the correct name? If not, they have the wrong name in their heads, which could be harmful in the long run.  
 Q: I am submitting a paper that extends my own work that previously appeared at a workshop. Should I anonymize any reference to that prior work?   
 A: No. But we recommend you do not use the same title for your POPL submission, so that it is clearly distinguished from the prior paper. In general, there is rarely a good reason to anonymize a citation. One possibility is for work that is tightly related to the present submission and is also under review. When in doubt, contact the Program Chair.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my (non-blinded) paper on my web page? Can I advertise the unblinded version of my paper on mailing lists or send it to colleagues? Can I give a talk about my work while it is under review? How do I handle social media? What about arXiv?   
 A: We have developed guidelines, described here, to help everyone navigate in the same way the tension between the normal communication of scientific results, which double-blind reviewing should not impede, and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of the authors for a submission. Roughly speaking, you may (of course!) discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are gray areas and trade-offs; we cannot describe every possible scenario.  
 Things you may  do:  
 Put your submission on your home page. 
  Discuss your work with anyone who is not on the review committees, or with people on the committees with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. 
  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on arXiv or a similar site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-blind reviewing, etc. 
  Things you should not  do:  
 Contact members of the review committees about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. 
  Publicize your work on major mailing lists used by the community (because potential reviewers likely read these lists). 
  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, POPL paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternately, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Program Chair. 
  Q: Will the fact that POPL is double-blind have an impact on handling conflicts-of-interest?   
 A: Double-blind reviewing does not change the principle that reviewers should not review papers with which they have a conflict of interest, even if they do not immediately know who the authors are. Authors declare conflicts of interest when submitting their papers using the guidelines in the call for papers. Papers will not be assigned to reviewers who have a conflict.  
 For reviewers   
 Q: What should I do if I learn the authors’ identity? What should I do if a prospective POPL author contacts me and asks to visit my institution?   
 A: If you feel that the authors’ actions are largely aimed at ensuring that potential reviewers know their identity, contact the Program Chair. Otherwise, you should not treat double-blind reviewing differently from other reviewing. In particular, refrain from seeking out information on the authors’ identity, but if you discover it accidentally this will not automatically disqualify you as a reviewer. Use your best judgment.  
 Q: The authors have provided a URL to supplemental material. I would like to see the material but I worry they will snoop my IP address and learn my identity. What should I do?   
 A: Contact the Program Chair, who will download the material on your behalf and make it available to you.  
 Q: If I am assigned a paper for which I feel I am not an expert, how do I seek an outside review?   
 A: PC members should do their own reviews, not delegate them to someone else. If doing so is problematic for some papers, e.g., you don’t feel completely qualified, then consider the following options. First, submit a review for your paper that is as careful as possible, outlining areas where you think your knowledge is lacking. Assuming we have sufficient expert reviews, that could be the end of it: non-expert reviews are valuable too, since conference attendees are by-and-large not experts for any given paper. Second, work with the PC Chair and/or Associate Chairs, who will check for conflicts and then solicit an external review if additional expertise is needed. Please do not contact outside reviewers yourself. As a last resort, if you feel like your review would be extremely uninformed and you’d rather not even submit a first cut, contact the Program Chair.  
 Q: How do we handle potential conflicts of interest since I cannot see the author names?   
 A: The conference review system will ask that you identify conflicts of interest when you get an account on the submission system. It is critical that you enter these at least a week before the POPL submission deadline. Feel free to also identify additional authors whose papers you feel you could not review fairly for reasons other than those given (e.g., strong personal friendship).  
 Q: How should I avoid learning the authors’ identity if I am using web-search in the process of performing my review?   
 A: You should make a good-faith effort not to find the authors’ identity during the review period, but if you inadvertently do so, this does not disqualify you from reviewing the paper. As part of the good-faith effort, do not use search engines with terms like the paper’s title or the name of a new system being discussed.  
  These guidelines are largely based on guidelines for PLDI 2020  , with slight modifications by Amal Ahmed based on the guidelines for POPL 2019  . Both of those are an evolution of guidelines originally created by Michael Hicks for POPL 2012.

 Call for Previously Un-presented SIGPLAN Paper Presentations  
  
 PLDI’23 will continue the tradition of allowing previously un-presented work from ICFP, POPL, and OOPSLA to be presented at PLDI. This mechanism is designed to provide an opportunity to authors who, for reasons beyond their control, could not present at the venue in which their work was accepted, and would like the opportunity to present to an audience at PLDI.  
 Please note that unfortunately there will be limited spots available due to the space constraints at the venue, so there is no guarantee that we will be able to accept your work for presentation at PLDI’23. We will announce decisions no later than Monday April 3, 2023.  
 Please use the form below to inform us of your desire to present your work at PLDI’23.  
 https://forms.gle/AZtKMwDNycDnWwvi9   

 Call for Papers  
  
 PACMPL Issue PLDI 2023 seeks contributions on all aspects of programming languages research, broadly construed, including design, implementation, theory, applications, and performance. Authors of papers published in PACMPL Issue PLDI 2023 will be invited to present their work in the PLDI conference in June 2023, which is sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN.  
 Scope   
 PLDI is a premier forum for programming language research, broadly construed. Outstanding research that extends and/or applies programming-language concepts to advance the field of computing is welcome. Novel system designs, thorough empirical work, well-motivated theoretical results, and new application areas are all in scope for PLDI.  
 Evaluation Criteria and Process   
 Reviewers will evaluate submissions for accuracy, significance, originality, and clarity. Submissions should be organized to communicate clearly to a broad programming-language audience as well as experts on the paper’s topics. Papers should identify what has been accomplished and how it relates to previous work. Authors of empirical papers are encouraged to consider the seven categories of the SIGPLAN Empirical Evaluation Guidelines  when preparing submissions.  
 To conform with ACM requirements for journal publication, the selection of papers will be made in two rounds of reviewing. In the first round, reviewers will assesses the papers according to the quality criteria listed above. Authors will be given several days to compose a written response to the reviews received in the first round—e.g., to correct errors and clarify technical concerns. At the end of the first round, the Review Committee will conditionally accept a subset of the submissions and all other submissions will be rejected. In the second round, authors of conditionally-accepted papers will be given an opportunity to improve specific aspects of the research and the paper, as identified by the reviewers. Authors will have sufficient time to perform the required revisions and re-submit the paper. The same reviewers as in the first round will then assess how the revision requests have been acted upon by the authors. Revisions that fail to adequately address the reviewers’ original concerns will result in rejection.  
 The Review Committee will make final decisions regarding (conditional) acceptance and rejection, although reviews for a given paper will typically be performed by a subset of the committee. Authors may only contact the Associate Editor about submitted papers during the review period. Contacting Review Committee members about submitted paper(s) is an ethical violation and may be grounds for summary rejection.  
 Deadlines and formatting requirements, detailed below, will be strictly enforced, with extremely rare extenuating circumstances considered at the discretion of the Associate Editor.  
 Double-Blind Reviewing   
 Consistent with double-blind reviewing, author names and affiliations must be omitted from the submission. If the submission refers to prior work done by the authors, that reference should be made in third person. Any supplementary material must also be anonymized. These are firm submission requirements. The Review Committee will only learn the identities of authors of accepted papers following the second round of reviewing.  
 The FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing  clarifies the policy for the most common scenarios. But there are many gray areas and trade-offs. If you have any doubts about how to interpret the double-blind rules, or any cases that are not fully covered by the FAQ, please contact the Associate Editor.  In complex cases, it is better to get guidance from the Associate Editor than to risk summary rejection.  
 Submission Site Information   
 The submission site is https://pldi2023.hotcrp.com  .  
 Authors can submit multiple times prior to the (firm!) deadline. Only the last submission will be reviewed. There is no abstract deadline. The submission site requires entering author names and affiliations, relevant topics, and potential conflicts. Addition or removal of authors after the submission deadline will need to be approved by the Associate Editor (as this kind of change potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts during paper assignment).  
 The submission deadline is 11:59PM November 10, 2022 anywhere on earth  : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth   
 Declaring Conflicts   
 When submitting the paper, you will need to declare potential conflicts. Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc). Other conflicts include institutional conflicts, financial conflicts of interest, friends or relatives, or any recent co-authors on papers and proposals (last 2 years).  
 Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are especially harmful if the aim is to subvert the normal peer-review process by excluding potential reviewers. Listing spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about whether or not a given relationship constitutes a conflict, please consult the Associate Editor.  
 Formatting Requirements   
 Each paper should have no more than 20 pages of text, excluding bibliography  , using the ACM Proceedings format. This format is chosen for compatibility with PACMPL. It is a single-column page layout with a 10 pt font, 12 pt line spacing, and wider margins than recent PLDI page layouts. In this format, the main text block is 5.478 in (13.91 cm) wide and 7.884 in (20.03 cm) tall. Use of a different format (e.g., smaller fonts or a larger text block) is grounds for summary rejection. PACMPL templates for Microsoft Word and LaTeX can be found at the SIGPLAN author information page  . Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex  file (found in the samples folder of the acmart  package) with the acmsmall  option. We also strongly encourage use of the review  and screen  options as well. Papers may be submmitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers must use author-year format for citations. Submissions should be in PDF and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper. Please take care to ensure that figures and tables are legible, even when the paper is printed in gray-scale. Papers that exceed the length requirement, deviate from the expected format, or are submitted late will be rejected.  
 Supplementary Material   
 Authors are welcome to provide supplementary material if that material supports the claims in the paper. Such material may include proofs, experimental results, and/or data sets. This material should be uploaded at the same time as the submission. Reviewers are not required to examine the supplementary material but may refer to it if they would like to find further evidence supporting the claims in the paper.  
 Plagiarism and Concurrent Work   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by the SIGPLAN Republication Policy  and ACM Policy on Plagiarism  . Concurrent submissions to other conferences, workshops, journals, or similar venues of publication are disallowed. Prior work must, as always, be cited and referred to in the third person even if it is the authors’ work, so as to preserve author anonymity. If you have further questions, please contact the Associate Editor.  
 Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers   
 Authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how well the artifacts support the work described in the papers. This submission is voluntary but encouraged and will not influence the final decision regarding the papers. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a badge printed on the papers themselves. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings, by including them as “source materials” in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Open Access and Copyright   
 As a Gold Open Access journal, PACMPL is committed to making peer-reviewed scientific research free of restrictions on both access and (re-)use. Authors are strongly encouraged to support liberal open access by licensing their work with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) license  , which grants readers (re-)use rights.  
 Authors of accepted papers will be required to provide an ORCID for each co-author and choose one of the following publication rights:  
 Author licenses the work with a | Creative Commons license | , retains copyright, and (implicitly) grants ACM non-exclusive permission to publish (suggested choice). 
  Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive permission to publish license. 
  Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive permission to publish license. 
  Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM. 
  These choices follow from ACM Copyright Policy and ACM Author Rights, corresponding to ACM’s “author pays” option. While PACMPL may ask authors who have funding for open-access fees to voluntarily cover the article processing charge (currently, US$400), payment is not required for publication. PACMPL and SIGPLAN continue to explore the best models for funding open access, focusing on approaches that are sustainable in the long-term while reducing short-term risk.  
 Publication Date   
 All papers will be archived by the ACM Digital Library. Authors will have the option of including supplementary material with their paper. The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library or the first day of the conference, which ever is sooner. Note that the date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 Presentations   
 Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present their work at PLDI. Authors who need financial assistance for travel to the conferences should apply for a grant from the SIGPLAN Professional Activities Committee (PAC) program. We welcome all authors, regardless of nationality. If authors are to obtain visas to travel to the conference despite making reasonable effort, we will make arrangements to facilitate remote participation or presentation by another attendee on behalf of the authors.  
 Distinguished Paper Awards   
 Up to 10% of the accepted papers may be designated as Distinguished Papers. This award highlights papers that the Review Committee believes should be read by a broad audience due to their relevance, originality, significance, and clarity. The set of distinguished papers will be chosen through a rigorous review process of the final papers, carried out by a subset of the Review Committee.  
 Acknowledgments   
 This call-for-papers is an adaptation and evolution of content from previous SIGPLAN conferences. We are grateful to prior organizers for their work, which is reused here.  

 FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing  
   
 General   
 Q: Why are you using double-blind reviewing?   
 A: Studies have shown that a reviewer’s attitude toward a submission may be affected, even unconsciously, by the identity of the authors. We want reviewers to be able to approach each submission without any such, possibly involuntary, pre-judgment. Many computer science publications have embraced double-blind reviewing. PLDI has used it for several years now and doing so is stipulated in the [Practices of PLDI](Practices of PLDI).  
 Q: Do you really think blinding actually works? I suspect reviewers can often guess who the authors are anyway.   
 A: It is rare for authorship to be guessed correctly, even by expert reviewers, as detailed in this study  .  
 Q: Couldn’t blind submission create an injustice where a paper is inappropriately rejected based upon supposedly-prior work which was actually by the same authors and not previously published?   
 A: Reviewers are held accountable for their positions and are required to identify any supposed prior work that they believe undermines the novelty of the paper. Any assertion that “this has been done before” by reviewers should be supported with concrete information. The author response mechanism exists in part to hold reviewers accountable for claims that may be incorrect.  
 For authors   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 A: Use common sense. Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are. The specific guidelines stated in the call for papers are simple: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on amphibious type systems, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on statically typed toads [Smith 2004],” you might say “We extend Smith’s [2004] earlier work on statically typed toads.” Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity. In general, you should aim to reduce the risk of accidental unblinding. For example, if your paper is the first to describe a system with a well-known name or codename, or you use a personally-identifiable naming convention for your work, then use a different name for your submission (which you may indicate has been changed for the purposes of double-blind reviewing). You should also avoid revealing the institutional affiliation of authors or at which the work was performed.  
 Q: I would like to provide supplementary material for consideration, e.g., the code of my implementation or proofs of theorems. How do I do this?   
 A (and also see the next question): On the submission site there will be an option to submit supplementary material along with your main paper. This supplementary material should also be anonymized; it may be viewed by reviewers during the review period, so it should adhere to the same double-blind guidelines.  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?   
 A: Making your code publicly available is not incompatible with double-blind reviewing. You should do the following. First, cite the code in your paper, but remove the actual URL and, instead say “link to repository removed for double-blind review” or similar. Second, if, when writing your author response, you believe reviewer access to your code would help, say so in your author response (without providing the URL), and upload a zip file containing the code under supplemental materials (but make sure that the code/documentation does not reveal the identity of the authors).  
 Q: I am building on my own past work on the WizWoz system. Do I need to rename this system in my paper for purposes of anonymity, so as to remove the implied connection between my authorship of past work on this system and my present submission?   
 A: Maybe. The core question is really whether the system is one that, once identified, automatically identifies the author(s) and/or the institution. If the system is widely available, and especially if it has a substantial body of contributors and has been out for a while, then these conditions may not hold (e.g., LLVM or HotSpot), because there would be considerable doubt about authorship. By contrast, a paper on a modification to a proprietary system (e.g., Visual C++, or a research project that has not open-sourced its code) implicitly reveals the identity of the authors or their institution. If naming your system essentially reveals your identity (or institution), then anonymize it. In your submission, point out that the system name has been anonymized. If you have any doubts, please contact the Associate Editor.  
 Q: I am submitting a paper that extends my own work that previously appeared at a workshop. Should I anonymize any reference to that prior work?   
 A: No. But we recommend you do not use the same title for your submission, so that it is clearly distinguished from the prior paper. In general, there is rarely a good reason to anonymize a citation. One possibility is for work that is tightly related to the present submission and is also under review. When in doubt, contact the Associate Editor.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my (non-blinded) paper on my web page? Can I advertise the unblinded version of my paper on mailing lists or send it to colleagues? Can I give a talk about my work while it is under review? How do I handle social media? What about arXiv?   
 A: We have developed guidelines, described here, to help everyone navigate in the same way the tension between the normal communication of scientific results, which double-blind reviewing should not impede, and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of the authors for a submission. Roughly speaking, you may (of course!) discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are gray areas and trade-offs; we cannot describe every possible scenario.  
 Things you may do:  
 Put your submission on your home page. 
  Discuss your work with anyone who is not on the Review Committee, or with people on the committees with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. 
  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on arXiv or a similar site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-blind reviewing, etc. 
  Things you should not do:  
 Contact members of the Review Committee about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. 
  Publicize your work on major mailing lists used by the community (because potential reviewers likely read these lists). 
  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, PLDI paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Associate Editor. 
  Q: Will the fact that PLDI is double-blind have an impact on handling conflicts-of-interest?   
 A: Double-blind reviewing does not change the principle that reviewers should not review papers with which they have a conflict of interest, even if they do not immediately know who the authors are. Authors declare conflicts-of-interest when submitting their papers using the guidelines in the call-for-papers. Papers will not be assigned to reviewers who have a conflict.  
 For reviewers   
 Q: What should I do if I learn the authors’ identity? What should I do if a prospective author contacts me and asks to visit my institution?   
 A: If you feel that the authors’ actions are largely aimed at ensuring that potential reviewers know their identity, contact the Associate Editor. Otherwise, you should not treat double-blind reviewing differently from other reviewing. In particular, refrain from seeking out information on the authors’ identity, but if you discover it accidentally this will not automatically disqualify you as a reviewer. Use your best judgment.  
 Q: If I am assigned a paper for which I feel I am not an expert, how do I seek an outside review?   
 A: PC members should write their own reviews and not delegate them to someone else. If doing so is problematic for some papers (e.g., you do not feel completely qualified), then please take the following steps: First, submit a review for your paper that is as careful as possible, outlining areas where you think your knowledge is lacking. Assuming we have sufficient expert reviews, that could be the end of it: non-expert reviews are valuable too, since conference attendees are by-and-large not experts for any given paper. Second, the review form provides a mechanism for suggesting additional expert reviewers to the PC Chair, who may contact them if additional expertise is needed. Please do not contact outside reviewers yourself.  
 Q: How do we handle potential conflicts of interest since I cannot see the author names?   
 A: The conference review system will ask that you identify conflicts of interest when you get an account on the submission system. Feel free to also identify additional authors whose papers you feel you could not review fairly for reasons other than those given (e.g., strong personal friendship).  
 Q: How should I avoid learning the authors’ identity if I am using web-search in the process of performing my review?   
 A: You should make a good-faith effort not to find the authors’ identity during the review period, but if you inadvertently do so, this does not disqualify you from reviewing the paper. As part of the good-faith effort, do not use search engines with terms like the paper’s title or the name of a new system being discussed. If you need to search for related work you believe exists, do so after completing a preliminary review of the paper.  
 Q: When will author identities be revealed?   
 A: The Review Committee will only learn the identities of authors of accepted papers following the second round of reviewing. The authors of rejected papers will remain anonymous to everyone except the Associate Editor.  
   
 Speaker's Guide  
   
 PLDI’23 Speaker’s Guide   
 This document is for those presenting a paper at PLDI’23. There are separate guides for ISMM, LCTES, and PLDI workshop speakers.  
 Congratulations on having your paper accepted at PLDI’23! This document will help ensure your presentation runs smoothly and has the best possible audience impact. Please read it in its entirety.  
 Checklist   
 Before PLDI:  
 Prepare and | practice | . 
  Ensure your talk runs for | no more than 15 minutes | . 
  Sign up for Discord | ( | details here | ). 
  Upload a backup copy of your talk slides | (follow steps listed below). 
  Check the program | to establish when and where your talk will be. 
  Ensure you have a | HDMI adaptor | for your device. 
  Before your talk:  
 Familiarize yourself with the room | you will be speaking in. 
  Find and | introduce yourself to your session chair | . 
  Find the Discord channel | for your session, so you can monitor questions. 
  Attend the mandatory video check | before your session (details below). 
  Ensure that you are in the room no later than 5 minutes before the start of your session. 
  After your talk:  
 Expect | questions from the floor | and session chair. 
  Once you’ve completed your talk and Q&A, | monitor Discord for follow-up questions | . 
  Preparing Your Talk   
 Your work will have a greater impact if you’re well prepared.  
 It is very important that you run to schedule. The PLDI’23 schedule is extremely tight, with hard stops imposed by FCRC scheduling. Session chairs have been asked to stick rigidly to the schedule.  
 Guidelines   
 Your talk should run for no more than 15 minutes | , uninterrupted. This gives you about four minutes for questions and one minute for speaker change-over. 
  Your talk should be prepared for the standard | 16:9 widescreen ratio | . If your talk is in a different ratio, at best it will be | pillarboxed | , wasting screen real estate and diminishing impact, and at worst, it won’t display correctly. 
  You will present your talk from a lectern, using a fixed lectern mic. 
  You should provide a backup copy of your slides ahead of time in either pdf or powerpoint. 
  If you have an embedded video in your presentation, please inform the video team during your mandatory video check before your session. 
  Uploading Your Presentation   
 As an insurance against technical failures, we ask all speakers to make a backup copy of their presentation available to the video team by uploading it the day before the session. You’re welcome to upload fresh copies at any time.  
 Format: your presentation must be saved as a powerpoint or pdf file (sorry!) 
  Naming: you must use your paper ID as your file name (e.g. <pldi paper ID>.[ppt,pptx,pdf]) 
  Location: please use this link: | https://bit.ly/pldi23upload 
  This requirement gives you assurance that if some major technical problem were to arise (such as a failure of your laptop), you will still be able to give your talk. If you do not make your presentation available in advance, and significant technical problems arise, we may have to shorten your presentation to keep to our tight schedule.  
 The requirement for you to use pdf or powerpoint for your backup copy is a pragmatic tradeoff. These slides will only be used in case of a technical emergency. We want to have the highest possible assurance that they will work without fuss on a third party device should such an emergency occur. If you use Google slides, Keynote, or some other software, please use the export feature to create either powerpoint or pdf backups.  
 If you elect not to upload a backup copy, please understand that this limits our volunteers’ capacity to assist you if a technical problem arises when you give your presentation.  
 Advice   
 There are many excellent sources of advice on giving good talks, including from Simon Peyton Jones  , Michael Hicks  , Michael Ernst  , Ranjit Jhala  , and Derek Dreyer  . Make good use of these!  
 Mandatory Video Check   
 All speakers are required to be in the room and check in with their session chair and the video team no later than 5 minutes before their session starts. You will need to plug a HDMI cord into your device. Please bring your own HDMI adapter, if required  . Please note that due to our very tight schedule, speakers who fail to upload their talk in advance and/or fail to attend the video check 5 minutes before their session may have their talk cut short if technical issues arise  .  
 Q&A   
 If you stick to the above schedule you will have about 4 minutes for questions. The in-room audience will be able to ask questions via a queue at a single microphone on a stand in the center of the room. In-room attendees and remote attendees will also be able to ask questions via Discord. Your session chair will monitor questions on Discord and might ask questions as they see them appearing there.  
 It is good practice, as the speaker, to repeat your understanding of the question before providing your answer. This is particularly important when time is tight because it reduces opportunities for time being wasted on account of a misunderstanding.  
 Once your talk is finished, please go on to Discord and respond to any questions or follow-up questions that appear there.  
 Remote Audience   
 Your talk will be streamed to Discord and YouTube with live captioning. Your remote audience will be able to write questions in the Discord channel created for your session (they won’t be able to ask questions via audio or video). They should see your slides, a video feed of you speaking, and live captions. As mentioned above, your session chair may relay questions from Discord.  
 Remote Presenters   
 If it isn’t possible for any of the authors to attend PLDI in person, you will need to have informed the program chair well in advance, and they will make special arrangements for you to present remotely.  
 The following notes apply only to those who have received permission from the program chair to present remotely. You should have been in direct contact with the PLDI video team on Discord.   
 Discord   
 We will use Discord as the virtual platform for this conference. You should familiarize yourself with Discord as an audience member well before your talk. We will use it for: a) the remote audience, b) delivery of remote talks, and c) communicating logistics.  
 If you are a remote speaker, 15 minutes before your talk, you should go to the voice channel #speakers-queue and wait to receive the Presenter role. With that, you’ll be able to see a private channel. Once that happens, share your screen and wait for the sign to start the presentation.  
 If you don’t receive the role, send a private message to Hanneli and let her know you are presenting shortly.  
 Connectivity   
 Please do the best you can to ensure that you have good connectivity at the time of your presentation. To protect against the possibility of a major technical failure, we encourage you to record a 15 minute video version of your talk, and share it with the video team well before your talk (see notes above for sharing slides). The video team can then use your video as a back-up in case of a major problem.  
 Limitations   
 Remote speakers should take care before including embedded audio in their talk. While this is possible, it can be difficult. If you need to do this, please consult directly with the video team and have it tested well in advance.  
 Q&A   
 Your session chair will introduce you and field questions just as for in-person sessions. You do not need to monitor Discord during your talk. Your Q&A will involve answering questions verbally, just as for in-person talks, only you’ll do so via video. As with in-person sessions, timing is very tight, so please be sure to stick to your 15 minute speaking time, or risk losing your Q&A time. You can respond to follow-up questions online after your talk has finished.  
   
 Session Chair Guide  
   
 Thank you for agreeing to serve as a session chair at PLDI ’23! Here are some basic instructions for session chairs to help everything run smoothly.  
 Well before your session…   
 Install Discord and familiarize yourself with the PLDI discord server and join the channel for your session. 
  Skim each paper in your session and come up with at least one question to ask during Q&A in case the audience doesn’t have any. 
  Consult the list of | PLDI Speakers | and contact each speaker. Ask them for guidance on name pronunciation and any other details they think might be important for introducing them. Also remind them find you in the break before the session to introduce themselves to you and do the mandatory A/V check. 
  If any talk in your session is being given remotely, contact the video team (Guilherme Espada, John Zhuang Hui, and Zixian Cai), for further instructions via the #video-chairs Discord channel 
  In the break just before your session…   
 Go to the meeting room at least 30 minutes before the session. 
  Introduce yourself to the A/V chairs and the student volunteers. 
  Familiarize yourself with the layout and arrangement of the meeting room. 
  Confirm that each speaker is present and help them do the mandatory A/V check. 
  During the session   
 Introduce the session by welcoming the audience and reminding them of the topic of the session. 
  One of your main jobs is to keep things on time. PLDI will often be dual-tracked, so it’s important to keep the two tracks roughly synchronized. Some participants decide to attend some of the talks in each session. 
  We recommend following this schedule for each 20-minute slot: | 1-15 minutes: speaker presents their paper 
  16-19 minute: session chair moderates Q&A 
  19-20 minute: next speaker sets up 
  Student volunteers will keep track of time, and display it on cards for you and the speaker. However, it’s your job to enforce time limits. 
  Tips for keeping things on time: | Try to catch the speaker’s eye with about 2 minutes remaining. You can point to the time cards being displayed by the student speaker so they are aware that their slot is almost done. 
  If the speaker is still talking after 15 minutes have elapsed, stand up and politely ask them to wrap up. 
  If they are still talking after 16 minutes have elapsed, speak into the microphone and say “we’ll have to end here to stay on time; let’s thank our speaker” and start applauding. 
  Tips for moderating Q&A: | As soon as the speaker has finished, stand up and say “Let’s thank our speaker” and start applauding. Invite the audience to ask questions. 
  Make sure people who ask questions use the mic and state their name and affiliation. Use of the microphone is essential. Please interject and insist that they use it. 
  If the audience has no questions, ask the one you prepared in advance. Usually this will be enough to get things going. 
  Check the Discord channel for your session. If any remote participants have questions, you can relay them to the room. 
  If the person asking the question goes on for a very long time, interject and ask them to bring it to a point. 
  If any questioners are belligerent or insulting, cut them off immediately and report them to the program chair (Nate Foster) or the general chair (Steve Blackburn). We sincerely hope and expect that this will not happen, but you should take action to enforce an inclusive and respectful conference environment. You can read over | SIGPLAN’s non-harassment policy here | , which is based on | ACM’s | . 
  At the end of the session, thank the audience for coming, and tell them what’s happening next (coffee break, plenary, lunch, etc.)

 (POPL 2023) ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages

 Description  

 PACMPL Issue POPL 2023 seeks contributions on all aspects of programming languages and programming systems, both theoretical and practical. Authors of papers published in PACMPL Issue POPL 2023 will be invited to present their work in the POPL conference in January 2023, which is sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN, in cooperation with ACM SIGACT and ACM SIGLOG.  
   
  This call for contributions is subject to change.  
   
  Scope:  
  Principles of Programming Languages is a forum for the discussion of all aspects of programming languages and programming systems. Both theoretical and experimental papers are welcome, on topics ranging from formal frameworks to experience reports. We seek submissions that make principled, enduring contributions to the theory, design, understanding, implementation or application of programming languages.  
   
  Submission Guidelines:  
  The following two points are easy to overlook:  
  Conflicts: Each author of a submission has to log into the submission system and properly declare all potential conflicts of interest in the author profile form. A conflict caught late in the reviewing process leads to a voided review which may be infeasible to replace.  
  Anonymity: POPL 2023 will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Make sure that your submitted paper is fully anonymized.

  Proposals submitted between November 18th and 30th will be evaluated on a first-come-first-served basis. 
  Notification   
 We will notify workshop/tutorial acceptance by December 9th  .  
 Timeline   
 Submission deadline (with proceedings): November 18   
 Submission deadline (no proceedings): November 30   
 Notification: December 9   
 Dissemination   
 A proposal should clearly state how the results of the workshop — i.e., published papers and other outcomes — will be made available to participants and others before and after the workshop event. The Workshops and Tutorials Chair will provide guidance to the organizers of accepted workshops that wish to publish proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. For those that choose to publish their papers in ACM Digital Library, please add the following text in the workshop call for papers and on the website:  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)  
 Workshops that elect to publish proceedings can do so in the ACM Digital Library with sponsoring by SIGPLAN. The application for SIGPLAN sponsorship includes reviewing the proposed program committee with the SIGPLAN Executive Committee, a process which the chairs will help facilitate.

 Workshop Speaker's Guide  
   
 PLDI’23 Workshop Speaker’s Guide   
 This document is for those presenting a paper at a PLDI’23 workshop ( ARRAY  , ASA  , CSC  , DRAGSTERS  , EGRAPHS  , Infer  , PLARCH  , PLMW  , or SOAP  ). There are separate guides for PLDI, ISMM, and LCTES speakers.  
 Congratulations on being a presenter! This document will help ensure your presentation runs smoothly and has the best possible audience impact. Please read it in its entirety.  
 Checklist   
 Before PLDI:  
 Prepare and | practice | . 
  Ensure that | your talk runs for the correct duration | (be sure to check). 
  Sign up for Discord | ( | details here | ). 
  Check the program | to establish when and where your talk will be. 
  Complete the | video consent form | (details below). 
  Ensure you have a | HDMI adaptor | for your device. 
  Before your talk:  
 Familiarize yourself with the room | you will be speaking in. 
  Find and | introduce yourself to your session chair | . 
  Find the Discord channel | for your session, so you can monitor questions. 
  Ensure that you are in the room no later than 5 minutes before your session. 
  After your talk:  
 Expect | questions from the floor | and session chair. 
  Once you’ve finished your talk, | check Discord for questions | . 
  Overview   
 Your program chair should have reached out to you with details about what is expected of you as a presenter. This document assumes you are familiar with those parameters.  
 Video Consent   
 All workshop talks will be streamed via Discord and YouTube, and will be available later via SIGPLAN’s YouTube channel. All speakers must therefore consent to being recorded.  
 If you are participating in ARRAY or SOAP, which have published proceedings, then you will have completed the consent form when you finalized your paper with the publisher.  
 If you are participating in any other workshop, you will need to complete the ACM video consent form  and upload it using this Google form  .  
 Preparing Your Talk   
 Your work will have a greater impact if you’re well prepared.  
 It is very important that you run to schedule. The schedule is extremely tight, with hard stops imposed by FCRC scheduling. Session chairs have been asked to stick rigidly to the schedule.  
 Guidelines   
 Make sure you know how long you have for your talk. | If your program chair has not given you explicit guidance, you should allow for five to ten minutes for questions and speaker change-over. 
  Your talk should be prepared for the standard | 16:9 widescreen ratio | . If your talk is in a different ratio, at best it will be | pillarboxed | , wasting screen real estate and diminishing impact, and at worst, it won’t display correctly. 
  You will present your talk from a lectern, using a fixed lectern mic. 
  You will need to provide your talk ahead of time in either pdf or powerpoint. 
  If you have an embedded video in your presentation, please inform the video team during your mandatory video check before your session. 
  Uploading Your Presentation   
 As an insurance against technical failures, we ask all speakers to make a backup copy of their presentation available to the video team by uploading it the day before the session. You’re welcome to upload fresh copies at any time.  
 Format: your presentation must be saved as a powerpoint or pdf file (sorry!) 
  Naming: 
  For ARRAY and SOAP, please use the paper ID assigned to you by the publisher (e.g. <paper ID>.[ppt,pptx,pdf]) 
  For all other workshops, please use the workshop name followed by speaker name in lower case with a [ppt,pptx,pdf] suffix (e.g. <arrray-smith.pptx). 
  Location: please use this link: | https://bit.ly/pldi23upload 
  This requirement gives you assurance that if some major technical problem were to arise (such as a failure of your laptop), you will still be able to give your talk. If you do not make your presentation available in advance, and significant technical problems arise, we may have to shorten your presentation to keep to our tight schedule.  
 The requirement for you to use pdf or powerpoint for your backup copy is a pragmatic tradeoff. These slides will only be used in case of a technical emergency. We want to have the highest possible assurance that they will work without fuss on a third party device should such an emergency occur. If you use Google slides, Keynote, or some other software, please use the export feature to create either powerpoint or pdf backups.  
 If you elect not to upload a backup copy, please understand that this limits our volunteers’ capacity to assist you if a technical problem arises when you give your presentation.  
 Advice   
 There are many excellent sources of advice on giving good talks, including from Simon Peyton Jones  , Michael Hicks  , Michael Ernst  , Ranjit Jhala  , and Derek Dreyer  . Make good use of these!  
 Video Check   
 All speakers are expected to be in the room and check in with their session chair and the video volunteer no later than 5 minutes before their session starts.  
 Q&A   
 If you stick to the above schedule you will have a good amount of time for questions. The in-room audience will not ask questions from their seats, but will be able to ask questions via a queue at a single microphone on a mic stand in the center of the room. In-room attendees and remote attendees will also be able to ask questions via Discord. Your session chair will monitor questions on Discord and might ask questions as they see them appearing there.  
 It is good practice as the speaker to repeat your understanding of the question before providing your answer. This is particularly important when time is tight because it reduces opportunities for time being wasted on account of a misunderstanding.  
 Once your talk is finished, please go on to Discord and respond to any questions or follow-up questions that appear there.  
 Remote Audience   
 Your talk will be streamed to Discord and YouTube. Your remote audience will be able to write questions in the Discord channel created for your session (they won’t be able to ask questions via audio or video). They should see your slides, and a video feed of you speaking.. As mentioned above, your session chair may relay questions from Discord.  
 Remote Presenters   
 Authors are expected to be present at the conference. If it is impossible for any of the authors to attend PLDI in person, you will need to have informed your program chair well in advance, and they may make special arrangements for you to present remotely.  
 The following notes apply only to those who have received permission from their program chair to present remotely. You should have been in direct contact with the PLDI video team on Discord.   
 Discord   
 We will use Discord as the virtual platform for this conference. You should familiarize yourself with Discord as an audience member well before your talk. We will use it for: a) the remote audience, b) delivery of remote talks, and c) communicating logistics.  
 If you are a remote speaker, 15 minutes before your talk, you should go to the voice channel #speakers-queue and wait to receive the Presenter role. With that, you’ll be able to see a private channel. Once that happens, share your screen and wait for the sign to start the presentation.  
 If you don’t receive the role, send a private message to Hanneli and let her know you are presenting shortly.  
 Connectivity   
 Please do the best you can to ensure that you have good connectivity at the time of your presentation. To protect against the possibility of a major technical failure, we encourage you to record a 15 minute video version of your talk, and share it with the video team well before your talk (see notes above for sharing slides). The video team can then use your video as a back-up in case of a major problem.  
 Limitations   
 Remote speakers should take care before including embedded audio in their talk. While this is possible, it can be difficult. If you need to do this, please consult directly with the video team and have it tested well in advance.  
 Q&A   
 Your session chair will introduce you and field questions just as for in-person sessions. You do not need to monitor Discord during your talk. Your Q&A will involve answering questions verbally, just as for in-person talks, only you’ll do so via video. As with in-person sessions, timing is very tight, so please be sure to stick to your 15 minute speaking time, or risk losing your Q&A time. You can respond to follow-up questions online after your talk has finished.

 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction  

 March 13-16, 2023 Stockholm, SE  

 We are excited to announce the 18th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human Robot Interaction (HRI). HRI 2023 is the 18th annual conference for basic and applied HRI research. Researchers from across the world present their best work to HRI to exchange ideas about the theory, technology, data, and science furthering the state-of-the-art in the field.  
 The conference theme for HRI 2023 is “HRI for all” and will focus on key HRI theories, methods, designs, studies, and technical advances that aim to understand and promote inclusion and diversity in HRI. We encourage the community to consider ways to both make the field a more inclusive place for those who may not feel included, as well as to encourage inclusion within our research methods and practices.  
 There are many ways to participate in HRI 2023, including full papers, late breaking reports, demos, videos, and workshops. There are many opportunities particularly for students and those new to the field to be involved, including via volunteering and participating in mentoring workshops.  
 The conference will be held from March 13-16, 2023 in Stockholm, Sweden. We aim to have it be a hybrid conference, with opportunities to participate both in person and online. We will post additional details as the conference date nears.  
 We look forward to seeing you in March!

 SESSION: Keynote Talks  
 Interaction Techniques with a Navigation Robot for the Visually Impaired   
 Chieko Asakawa 
  Robotic technology has long been seen as a potential mobility aid for the visually impaired and the latest advancements in sensing and artificial intelligence have made it a reality. Before starting the project we researched the capabilities of and user interactions with guide dogs. We discovered that the rich haptic interaction with the “handle” allows users to comfortably follow a guide dog.  
 We then began designing a navigation robot with a handle that is small and slim enough to be followed in a similar body posture. Our goal was to make the robot natural and seamless in an urban environment leading us to the concept of the AI Suitcase a suitcase-shaped robot. In this presentation after reviewing the capabilities of a guide dog we will explain the concept design and implementation of the AI Suitcase and interaction techniques with the robot. We will also discuss the challenges of implementing such new robotic technologies in the real world including technical challenges infrastructure challenges business models and social acceptance.

 Robotics Research and Teaching with a Feminist Lens   
 Ericka Johnson 
  Feminism is more than (and often not even) an interest in women’s issues. For our robotics research, we use feminist theory as an analytical toolbox, filled with terms and insights to make visible and probe questions of power, representation, and expectations about and between humans and robots in the entangled encounters produced by social robots. Some of these questions are related to gender. Feminist theory gives us a vocabulary to talk about the materiality of robots, but also their positioning in our social encounters, real and imaginary? and how they position us, the users, in those encounters. This keynote will present some of the theoretical insights from feminism and intersectionality that we have found useful & generative; discuss how and where we apply them to our studies of social robots; and reflect on our experiences using these concepts to teach engineering students.  
 BIO: Ericka Johnson is a professor of gender and society at Linköping University, Sweden, and a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. She has an interdisciplinary background in sociology, gender studies, and science & technology studies. Her work explores how technologies of the body refract discourses articulate silent understandings, highlight cultural values, and make tangible social norms, with a particular interest for technologies of the digital body, from medical simulators to care robots. She is the author of several monographs and anthologies, including: A Cultural Biography of the Prostate (MIT Press 2021) Refracting through Technology (Routledge 2019), and Gendering Drugs: Feminist Studies of Pharmaceuticals (Palgrave 2018). Together with Dr. Katherine Harrison and professor Ginevra Castellano, she is leading an interdisciplinary research project on the ethics and social consequences of AI and caring robots, funded by WASP-HS.  

 Robots in Real Life: Putting HRI to Work   
 Andrea Thomaz 
  This talk will be focused on the unique challenges in deploying a mobile manipulation robot into an environment where the robot is working closely with people on a daily basis. Diligent Robotics’ first product Moxi, is a mobile manipulation service robot that is at work in hospitals today assisting nurses and other front line staff with materials management tasks. This talk will dive into the computational complexity of developing a mobile manipulator with social intelligence. Dr. Thomaz will focus on how human-robot interaction theories and algorithms translate into the real-world and the impact on functionality and perception of robots that perform delivery tasks in a busy human environment. The talk will include many examples and data from the field, with commentary and discussion around both the expected and unexpected hard problems in building robots operating 24/7 as reliable teammates.

  Only a small percentage of blind and low-vision people use traditional mobility aids such as a cane or a guide dog. Various assistive technologies have been proposed to address the limitations of traditional mobility aids. These devices often give either the user or the device majority of the control. In this work we explore how varying levels of control affect the users’ sense of agency, trust in the device, confidence and successful navigation. We present Glide, a novel mobility aid with two modes for control: Glide-directed and User-directed. We employ Glide in a study (N=9) in which blind or low-vision participants used both modes to navigate through an indoor environment. Overall, participants found that Glide was easy to use and learn. Most participants trusted Glide despite its current limitations, and their confidence and performance increased as they continued to use Glide. Users’ control mode preferences varied in different situations; no single mode “won” in all situations.

  Inclusion is key in group work and collaborative learning. We developed a mediator robot to support and promote inclusion in group conversations particularly in groups composed of children with and without visual impairment. We investigate the effect of two mediation strategies on group dynamics inclusion and perception of the robot. We conducted a within-subjects study with 78 children 26 experienced visual impairments in a decision-making activity. Results indicate that the robot can foster inclusion in mixed-visual ability group conversations. The robot succeeds in balancing participation particularly when using a highly intervening mediating strategy (directive strategy). However children feel more heard by their peers when the robot is less intervening (organic strategy). We extend prior work on social robots to assist group work and contribute with a mediator robot that enables children with visual impairments to engage equally in group conversations. We finish by discussing design implications for inclusive social robots.

  Social dining i.e., eating with/in company is replete with meaning and cultural significance. Unfortunately for the 1.8 million Americans with motor impairments who cannot eat without assistance challenges restrict them from enjoying this pleasant social ritual. In this work we identify the needs of participants with motor impairments during social dining and how robot-assisted feeding can address them. Using speculative videos that show robot behaviors within a social dining context we interviewed participants to understand their preferences. Following a community-based participatory research method we worked with a community researcher with motor impairments throughout this study. We contribute (a) insights into how a robot can help overcome challenges in social dining, (b) design principles for creating robot-assisted feeding systems, (c) and an implementation guide for future research in this area. Our key finding is that robots’ unique assistive qualities can address challenges people with motor impairments face during social dining, promoting empowerment and belonging.

  This research designed and applied 24 multi-purposeful robot activities of varying social mediation levels in a multiple-session experiment with 34 children of diverse autistic characteristics in a rehabilitation setting. This paper explores what type of robot activities can meet individual needs to bring more socio-behavioral progress and juxtaposes child characteristics to identify behavioral outcomes in each activity. This knowledge would help us to respond to the question of what activity types suit specific subgroups of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Our data analysis included coding 48.5 hours of video data for a total of 14 measures to fully capture children’s activity-based socio-emotional outcomes. Overall, the activities on varying social mediation levels brought more or less positive social outcomes to all children. However, children showed some different behavioral outcomes as mediated by core autism-related and age-specific characteristics. This study provides in-depth accounts of what might be helpful in designing and applying multi-purposeful activities responsive to the diverse needs of children.  

 Get SMART: Collaborative Goal Setting with Cognitively Assistive Robots

  Many robot-delivered health interventions aim to support people longitudinally at home to complement or replace in-clinic treatments. However there is little guidance on how robots can support collaborative goal setting (CGS). CGS is the process in which a person works with a clinician to set and modify their goals for care; it can improve treatment adherence and efficacy. However for home-deployed robots clinicians will have limited availability to help set and modify goals over time which necessitates that robots support CGS on their own. In this work we explore how robots can facilitate CGS in the context of our robot CARMEN (Cognitively Assistive Robot for Motivation and Neurorehabilitation), which delivers neurorehabilitation to people with mild cognitive impairment (PwMCI). We co-designed robot behaviors for supporting CGS with clinical neuropsychologists and PwMCI and prototyped them on CARMEN. We present feedback on how PwMCI envision these behaviors supporting goal progress and motivation during an intervention. We report insights on how to support this process with home-deployed robots and propose a framework to support HRI researchers interested in exploring this both in the context of cognitively assistive robots and beyond. This work supports designing and implementing CGS on robots which will ultimately extend the efficacy of robot-delivered health interventions.

  This work presents a novel ultrasonic haptic interface to improve nonvisual perception and situational awareness in applications such as fully autonomous vehicles. User study results (n=14) suggest comparable performance with the dynamic ultrasonic stimuli versus a control using static embossed stimuli. The utility of the ultrasonic interface is demonstrated with a prototype autonomous small-scale robot vehicle using intersection abstractions. These efforts support the application of ultrasonic haptics for improving nonvisual information access in autonomous transportation with strong implications for people who are blind and visually impaired accessibility and human-in-the-loop decision making.  

 “Being in on the Action” in Mobile Robotic Telepresence: Rethinking Presence in Hybrid Participation   
 Andriana Boudouraki 
  Joel E. Fischer 
  Stuart Reeves 
  Sean Rintel 
  Mobile Robotic Telepresence (MRP) systems afford remote communication with an embodied physicality and autonomous mobility which is thought to be useful for creating a sense of presence in hybrid activities. In this paper drawing on phenomenology we interviewed seven long term users of MRP to understand the lived experience of participating in hybrid spaces through a telepresence robot. The users’ accounts show how the capabilities of the robot impact interactions, and how telepresence differs from in-person presence. Whilst not feeling as if they were really there, users felt present when they were being able to participate in local action and be treated as present. They also report standing out and being subject to behaviour amounting to ‘ othering’. We argue that these experiences point to a need for future work on telepresence to focus on giving remote users the means to exercise autonomy in ways that enable them to participate — to be ‘ in on the action’ — rather than in ways that simply simulate being in-person.

  Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is inherently a human-centric field of technology. The role of feminist theories in related fields (e.g. Human-Computer Interaction, Data Science) are taken as a starting point to present a vision for Feminist HRI which can support better more ethical HRI practice everyday as well as a more activist research and design stance. We first define feminist design for an HRI audience and use a set of feminist principles from neighboring fields to examine existent HRI literature showing the progress that has been made already alongside some additional potential ways forward. Following this we identify a set of reflexive questions to be posed throughout the HRI design research and development pipeline encouraging a sensitivity to power and to individuals’ goals and values. Importantly, we do not look to present a definitive, fixed notion of Feminist HRI, but rather demonstrate the ways in which bringing feminist principles to our field can lead to better, more ethical HRI, and to discuss how we, the HRI community, might do this in practice.  

 Implications of AI Bias in HRI: Risks (and Opportunities) when Interacting with a Biased Robot   
 Tom Hitron 
  Noa Morag Yaar 
  Hadas Erel 
  Social robotic behavior is commonly designed using AI algorithms which are trained on human behavioral data. This training process may result in robotic behaviors that echo human biases and stereotypes. In this work we evaluated whether an interaction with a biased robotic object can increase participants’ stereotypical thinking. In the study, a gender-biased robot moderated debates between two participants (man and woman) in three conditions: (1) The robot’ s behavior matched gender stereotypes (Pro-Man); (2) The robot’s behavior countered gender stereotypes (Pro-Woman); (3) The robot’ s behavior did not reflect gender stereotypes and did not counter them (No-Preference). Quantitative and qualitative measures indicated that the interaction with the robot in the Pro-Man condition increased participants’ stereotypical thinking. In the No-Preference condition, stereotypical thinking was also observed but to a lesser extent. In contrast when the robot displayed counter-biased behavior in the Pro-Woman condition, stereotypical thinking was eliminated. Our findings suggest that HRI designers must be conscious of AI algorithmic biases, as interactions with biased robots can reinforce implicit stereotypical thinking and exacerbate existing biases in society. On the other hand, counter-biased robotic behavior can be leveraged to support present efforts to address the negative impact of stereotypical thinking.  

 SESSION: Human-robot Communication  
 No to the Right: Online Language Corrections for Robotic Manipulation via Shared Autonomy

  Systems for language-guided human-robot interaction must satisfy two key desiderata for broad adoption: adaptivity and learning efficiency. Unfortunately existing instruction-following agents cannot adapt lacking the ability to incorporate online natural language supervision and even if they could require hundreds of demonstrations to learn even simple policies. In this work we address these problems by presenting Language-Informed Latent Actions with Corrections (LILAC), a framework for incorporating and adapting to natural language corrections “to the right”, or “no, towards the book” – online during execution. We explore rich manipulation domains within a shared autonomy paradigm. Instead of discrete turn-taking between a human and robot LILAC splits agency between the human and robot: language is an input to a learned model that produces a meaningful low-dimensional control space that the human can use to guide the robot. Each real-time correction refines the human’s control space, enabling precise, extended behaviors – with the added benefit of requiring only a handful of demonstrations to learn. We evaluate our approach via a user study where users work with a Franka Emika Panda manipulator to complete complex manipulation tasks. Compared to existing learned baselines covering both open-loop instruction following and single-turn shared autonomy, we show that our corrections-aware approach obtains higher task completion rates, and is subjectively preferred by users because of its reliability, precision, and ease of use.  

 Do You Follow?: A Fully Automated System for Adaptive Robot Presenters   
 Agnes Axelsson 
  Gabriel Skantze 
  An interesting application for social robots is to act as a presenter for example as a museum guide. In this paper we present a fully automated system architecture for building adaptive presentations for embodied agents. The presentation is generated from a knowledge graph which is also used to track the grounding state of information based on multimodal feedback from the user. We introduce a novel way to use large-scale language models (GPT-3 in our case) to lexicalise arbitrary knowledge graph triples greatly simplifying the design of this aspect of the system. We also present an evaluation where 43 participants interacted with the system. The results show that users prefer the adaptive system and consider it more human-like and flexible than a static version of the same system but only partial results are seen in their learning of the facts presented by the robot.  

 Fresh Start: Encouraging Politeness in Wakeword-Driven Human-Robot Interaction   
 Ruchen Wen 
  Alyssa Hanson 
  Zhao Han 
  Tom Williams 
  Deployed social robots are increasingly relying on wakeword-based interaction where interactions are human-initiated by a wakeword like “Hey Jibo” . While wakewords help to increase speech recognition accuracy and ensure privacy there is concern that wakeword-driven interaction could encourage impolite behavior because wakeword-driven speech is typically phrased as commands. To address these concerns companies have sought to use wakeword design to encourage interactant politeness through wakewords like “Name?, please” . But while this solution is intended to encourage people to use more “polite words”, researchers have found that these wakeword designs actually decrease interactant politeness in text-based communication and that other wakeword designs could better encourage politeness by priming users to use Indirect Speech Acts. Yet there has been no previous research to directly compare these wakewords designs in in-person voice-based human-robot interaction experiments and previous in-person HRI studies could not effectively study carryover of wakeword-driven politeness and impoliteness into human-human interactions. In this work we conceptually reproduced these previous studies (n=69) to assess how the wakewords “Hey ” Name””, “Excuse me ” Name?”, and ” Name?, please” impact robot-directed and human-directed politeness. Our results demonstrate the ways that different types of linguistic priming interact in nuanced ways to induce different types of robot-directed and human-directed politeness.  

 I Need Your Help… or Do I?: Maintaining Situation Awareness through Performative Autonomy   
 Sayanti Roy

  Interactive intelligent systems are increasingly being deployed in safety critical contexts like Space Exploration. For humans to safely and successfully complete collaborative tasks with robots in these contexts they must maintain Situational Awareness of their task context without being cognitively overloaded — regardless of whether they are co-located with robots or interacting with them from a distance of thousands or millions of miles. In this paper we present a novel autonomy design strategy we term Performative Autonomy in which robots behave as if they have a lower level of autonomy than they are truly capable of (i.e., asking for advice they do not believe they truly need), for the sole purpose of maintaining interactants’ Situational Awareness. In our first experiment (n=264), we begin by demonstrating that Performative Autonomy can increase Situational Awareness (SA) without overly increasing workload, and that this is true across tasks with different baseline levels of Mental Workload. In our second experiment (n=318), we consider cases where robots do not believe they need advice, but in fact have faulty perception or decision making capabilities. In this experiment, we only observed benefits to Performative Autonomy for specific types of questions, and only when there was significant cognitive load imposed by a secondary task; yet we observed uniform benefit on task performance for asking these types of questions regardless of task-imposed Mental workload. Our results from these two studies (total n=582) thus provide strong support for using this autonomy design strategy in future safety-critical missions as humanity explores the Moon, Mars, and beyond.  

 Communicative Robot Signals: Presenting a New Typology for Human-Robot Interaction   
 Patrick Holthaus

  Gabriella Lakatos 
  Rebekka Soma 
  We present a new typology for classifying signals from robots when they communicate with humans. For inspiration we use ethology the study of animal behaviour and previous efforts from literature as guides in defining the typology. The typology is based on communicative signals that consist of five properties: the origin where the signal comes from the deliberateness of the signal the signal’s reference, the genuineness of the signal, and its clarity (i.e., how implicit or explicit it is). Using the accompanying worksheet, the typology is straightforward to use to examine communicative signals from previous human-robot interactions and provides guidance for designers to use the typology when designing new robot behaviours.  

 Hmm You Seem Confused ! Tracking Interlocutor Confusion for Situated Task-Oriented HRI   
 Na Li 
  Robert Ross 
  Our research seeks to develop a long-lasting and high-quality engagement between the user and the social robot which in turn requires a more sophisticated alignment of the user and the system than is currently commonly available. Close monitoring of interlocutors’ states, and we argue their confusion state in particular, and adjusting dialogue policies based on this state of confusion is needed for successful joint activity. In this paper, we present an initial study of human-robot conversation scenarios using a Pepper robot to investigate the confusion states of users. A Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) HRI experiment is illustrated in detail with stimuli strategies to trigger confused states from interlocutors. For the collected data, we estimated emotions, head pose, and eye gaze, and these features were analysed against the silence duration time of the speech data and the post-study self-reported confusion states that are reported by participants. Our analysis found a significant relationship between confusion states and most of these features. We see these results as being particularly significant for multimodal situated dialogues for human-robot interaction and beyond.  

 Crossing Reality: Comparing Physical and Virtual Robot Deixis

  Augmented Reality (AR) technologies present an exciting new medium for human-robot interactions enabling new opportunities for both implicit and explicit human-robot communication. For example these technologies enable physically-limited robots to execute non-verbal interaction patterns such as deictic gestures despite lacking the physical morphology necessary to do so. However a wealth of HRI research has demonstrated real benefits to physical embodiment (compared to, e.g., virtual robots on screens), suggesting AR augmentation of virtual robot parts could face challenges. In this work we present empirical evidence comparing the use of virtual (AR) and physical arms to perform deictic gestures that identify virtual or physical referents. Our subjective and objective results demonstrate the success of mixed reality deictic gestures in overcoming these potential limitations and their successful use regardless of differences in physicality between gesture and referent. These results help to motivate the further deployment of mixed reality robotic systems and provide nuanced insight into the role of mixed-reality technologies in HRI contexts.  

 The Effect of Simple Emotional Gesturing in a Socially Assistive Robot on Child’s Engagement at a Group Vaccination Day   
 Anouk Neerincx

  Maartje M.A. de Graaf 
  Children encounter high levels of stress and anxiety before receiving medical treatment such as a vaccination. This paper explores the effect of emotional gesturing in socially assistive robots (SARs) on children’s observed and self-reported engagement, as well as self-reported anxiety, fear, and trust during a group vaccination. A total of 249 children interacted with the social robot iPal before and after receiving the vaccine. Our results show an overall positive effect of adding emotional gestures to a SAR’ s interaction behavior leading to increased engagement and lower anxiety while increased engagement also resulted in trusting the robot more. Thus adding emotional gestures during child-robot interaction is a powerful way to improve the child’s experience during a group vaccination day.  

 Designing Robot Sound-In-Interaction: The Case of Autonomous Public Transport Shuttle Buses   
 Hannah R. M. Pelikan 
  Malte F. Jung 
  Horns and sirens are important tools for communicating on the road which are still understudied in autonomous vehicles. While HRI has explored different ways in which robots could sound we focus on the range of actions that a single sound can accomplish in interaction. In a Research through Design study involving autonomous shuttle buses in public transport we explored sound design with the help of voice-overs to video recordings of the buses on the road and Wizard-of-Oz tests in live traffic. The buses are slowed down by (unnecessary) braking in response to people getting close. We found that prolonged jingles draw attention to the bus and invite interaction while repeated short beeps and bell sounds can instruct the movement of others away from the bus. We highlight the importance of designing sound in sequential interaction and describe a new method for embedding video interaction analysis in the design process.  

 Coffee Tea Robots?: The Performative Staging of Service Robots in ‘Robot Cafes’ in Japan   
 Waki Kamino 
  Selma Sabanovic 
  We present an ethnographic observational study of six robot cafes in Japan to understand how service robots are performatively staged and presented to the public. We particularly attend to the diverse ways in which the physical setting and ambience of the cafes the verbal characterization of and staff behaviors toward robots explicit and implicit instructions on appropriate interactions with robots and handling of robot malfunctions constitute robots as socially acceptable and useful in daily life. Such scaffolding enables robots to provide material and affective services to cafe visitors and visitors to explore various interaction possibilities with robots. Our work contributes to the critical study of the ongoing construction of “robot cultures” in Japan and calls attention to public interactions with robots and the importance of contextual staging beyond individual robot features in human-robot interaction design.

  This paper examines the advantages and disadvantages of combining Human-Like and Machine-Like behaviors for a robot taking a shared elevator with a bystander as part of an office delivery service scenario. We present findings of an in-person wizard-of-oz experiment that builds on and implements behavior policies developed in a previous study. In this experiment we found that the combination of Machine-Like and Human-Like behaviors was perceived as better than Human-Like behaviors alone. We discuss possible reasons and point to key capabilities that a socially competent robot should have to achieve better Human-Like behaviors in order to seamlessly negotiate a social encounter with bystanders in a shared elevator or similar scenario. We found that establishing and maintaining a shared transactional space is one of these key requirements.  

 Studying Mind Perception in Social Robotics Implicitly: The Need for Validation and Norming

  The recent shift towards incorporating implicit measurements into the mind perception studies in social robotics has come along with its promises and challenges. The implicit tasks can go beyond the limited scope of the explicit tasks and increase the robustness of empirical investigations in human-robot interaction (HRI). However designing valid and reliable implicit tasks requires norming and validating all stimuli to ensure no confounding factors interfere with the experimental manipulations. We conducted a lexical norming study to systematically explore the concepts suitable for an implicit task that measures mind perception induced by social robots. Two-hundred seventy-four participants rated an expanded and strictly selected list of forty mental capacities in two categories: Agency and Experience and in two levels of capacities: High and Low. We used the partitioning around medoids algorithm as an objective way of revealing the clusters. We discussed the different clustering solutions in light of the previous findings. We consulted on frequency-based natural language processing (NLP) on the answers to the open-ended questions. The NLP analyses verified the significance of clear instructions and the presence of some common conceptualizations across dimensions. We proposed a systematic approach that encourages validation and norming studies which will further improve the reliability and reproducibility of HRI studies.  

 Your Way Or My Way: Improving Human-Robot Co-Navigation Through Robot Intent and Pedestrian Prediction Visualisations

  As mobile robots enter shared urban spaces operating in close proximity to people this raises new challenges in terms of how these robots communicate with passers-by. Following an iterative process involving expert focus groups (n=8), we designed an augmented reality concept that visualises the robot’s navigation intent and the pedestrian’ s predicted path. To understand the impact of path visualisations on trust sense of agency user experience and robot understandability we conducted a virtual reality evaluation (n=20). We compared visualising both robot intent and pedestrian path prediction against just visualising robot intent and a baseline without augmentation. The presence of path visualisations resulted in a significant improvement of trust. Triangulation of quantitative and qualitative results further highlights the impact of pedestrian path prediction visualisation on robot understandability as it allows for exploratory interaction.  

 On Using Social Signals to Enable Flexible Error-Aware HRI

  Prior error management techniques often do not possess the versatility to appropriately address robot errors across tasks and scenarios. Their fundamental framework involves explicit manual error management and implicit domain-specific information driven error management tailoring their response for specific interaction contexts. We present a framework for approaching error-aware systems by adding implicit social signals as another information channel to create more flexibility in application. To support this notion we introduce a novel dataset (composed of three data collections) with a focus on understanding natural facial action unit (AU) responses to robot errors during physical-based human-robot interactions—varying across task error people and scenario. Analysis of the dataset reveals that through the lens of error detection using AUs as input into error management affords flexibility to the system and has the potential to improve error detection response rate. In addition we provide an example real-time interactive robot error management system using the error-aware framework.  

 Illustrating Robot Movements

  Jared W. Donovan 
  Markus Rittenbruch 
  In efforts to disseminate research on human-robot interaction many researchers use illustrations in the form of sketches photographs and 3D models of robot movements. These illustrations are not only useful for building on the research but they also capture ways researchers think about robot movement. In this paper we review papers from the ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction in which such illustrations are presented supplementary to the text. We analyse a total of 181 illustrations from 137 papers to understand the diverse ways in which robot movements are illustrated as well as how each style supports and limits information about the movements. We identify 10 basic styles that are used. Based on a visual analysis of these styles we provide a detailed examination of each. This paper contributes with an overview that can be used to support future dissemination within the HRI research community. We present four aspects to consider for future illustrations and a discussion on how our findings could be utilised in early design processes.

  This paper proposes a machine learning (ML) approach to detect and resolve motion conflicts that occur between a human and a proactive robot during the execution of a physically collaborative task. We train a random forest classifier to distinguish between harmonious and conflicting human-robot interaction behaviors during object co-manipulation. Kinesthetic information generated through the teamwork is used to describe the interactive quality of collaboration. As such we demonstrate that features derived from haptic (force/torque) data are sufficient to classify if the human and the robot harmoniously manipulate the object or they face a conflict. A conflict resolution strategy is implemented to get the robotic partner to proactively contribute to the task via online trajectory planning whenever interactive motion patterns are harmonious and to follow the human lead when a conflict is detected. An admittance controller regulates the physical interaction between the human and the robot during the task. This enables the robot to follow the human passively when there is a conflict. An artificial potential field is used to proactively control the robot motion when partners work in harmony. An experimental study is designed to create scenarios involving harmonious and conflicting interactions during collaborative manipulation of an object and to create a dataset to train and test the random forest classifier. The results of the study show that ML can successfully detect conflicts and the proposed conflict resolution mechanism reduces human force and effort significantly compared to the case of a passive robot that always follows the human partner and a proactive robot that cannot resolve conflicts.

  We study human-robot handovers in a naturalistic collaboration scenario where a mobile manipulator robot assists a person during a crafting session by providing and retrieving objects used for wooden piece assembly (functional activities) and painting (creative activities). We collect quantitative and qualitative data from 20 participants in a Wizard-of-Oz study generating the Functional And Creative Tasks Human-Robot Collaboration dataset (the FACT HRC dataset), available to the research community. This work illustrates how social cues and task context inform the temporal-spatial coordination in human-robot handovers and how human-robot collaboration is shaped by and in turn influences people’s functional and creative activities.

  As high-speed agile robots become more commonplace these robots will have the potential to better aid and collaborate with humans. However due to the increased agility and functionality of these robots close collaboration with humans can create safety concerns that alter team dynamics and degrade task performance. In this work we aim to enable the deployment of safe and trustworthy agile robots that operate in proximity with humans. We do so by 1) Proposing a novel human-robot doubles table tennis scenario to serve as a testbed for studying agile proximate human-robot collaboration and 2) Conducting a user-study to understand how attributes of the robot (e.g., robot competency or capacity to communicate) impact team dynamics perceived safety and perceived trust and how these latent factors affect human-robot collaboration (HRC) performance. We find that robot competency significantly increases perceived trust (p < .001), extending skill-to-trust assessments in prior studies to agile proximate HRC. Furthermore interestingly we find that when the robot vocalizes its intention to perform a task it results in a significant decrease in team performance (p=.037) and perceived safety of the system (p=.009).  

 “What If It Is Wrong”: Effects of Power Dynamics and Trust Repair Strategy on Trust and Compliance in HRI

  Robotic systems designed to work alongside people are susceptible to technical and unexpected errors. Prior work has investigated a variety of strategies aimed at repairing people’s trust in the robot after its erroneous operations. In this work, we explore the effect of post-error trust repair strategies (promise and explanation) on people’ s trust in the robot under varying power dynamics (supervisor and subordinate robot). Our results show that regardless of the power dynamics promise is more effective at repairing user trust than explanation. Moreover people found a supervisor robot with verbal trust repair to be more trustworthy than a subordinate robot with verbal trust repair. Our results further reveal that people are prone to complying with the supervisor robot even if it is wrong. We discuss the ethical concerns in the use of supervisor robot and potential interventions to prevent improper compliance in users for more productive human-robot collaboration.  

 Trust-Aware Planning: Modeling Trust Evolution in Iterated Human-Robot Interaction

  Trust between team members is an essential requirement for any successful cooperation. Thus engendering and maintaining the fellow team members’ trust becomes a central responsibility for any member trying to not only successfully participate in the task but to ensure the team achieves its goals. The problem of trust management is particularly challenging in mixed human-robot teams where the human and the robot may have different models about the task at hand and thus may have different expectations regarding the current course of action, thereby forcing the robot to focus on the costly explicable behavior. We propose a computational model for capturing and modulating trust in such iterated human-robot interaction settings where the human adopts a supervisory role. In our model, the robot integrates human’ s trust and their expectations about the robot into its planning process to build and maintain trust over the interaction horizon. By establishing the required level of trust the robot can focus on maximizing the team goal by eschewing explicit explanatory or explicable behavior without worrying about the human supervisor monitoring and intervening to stop behaviors they may not necessarily understand. We model this reasoning about trust levels as a meta reasoning process over individual planning tasks. We additionally validate our model through a human subject experiment.  

 Verbally Soliciting Human Feedback in Continuous Human-Robot Collaboration: Effects of the Framing and Timing of Reminders   
 Kate Candon

  Sarah Gillet 
  Marynel Vázquez 
  Humans expect robots to learn from their feedback and adapt to their preferences. However there are limitations with how humans provide feedback to robots e.g., humans may give less feedback as interactions progress. Therefore it would be advantageous if robots could influence humans to provide more feedback during interactions. We conducted a 2×2 between-subjects user study (N=71) to investigate whether the framing and timing of a robot’s reminder to provide feedback could influence human interactants. Human-robot interactions took place in the context of Space Invaders, a fast-paced and continuous collaborative environment. Our results suggest that reminders can influence the amount of feedback humans provide to robots, how participants feel about the robot, and how they feel about providing feedback during the interaction.

 Robotic Mental Well-being Coaches for the Workplace: An In-the-Wild Study on Form   
 Micol Spitale

  The World Health Organization recommends that employers take action to protect and promote mental well-being at work. However the extent to which these recommended practices can be implemented in the workplace is limited by the lack of resources and personnel availability. Robots have been shown to have great potential for promoting mental well-being and the gradual adoption of such assistive technology may allow employers to overcome the aforementioned resource barriers. This paper presents the first study that investigates the deployment and use of two different forms of robotic well-being coaches in the workplace in collaboration with a tech company whose employees (26 coachees) interacted with either a QTrobot (QT) or a Misty robot (M). We endowed the robots with a coaching personality to deliver positive psychology exercises over four weeks (one exercise per week). Our results show that the robot form significantly impacts coachees’ perceptions of the robotic coach in the workplace. Coachees perceived the robotic coach in M more positively than in QT (both in terms of behaviour appropriateness and perceived personality), and they felt more connection with the robotic coach in M. Our study provides valuable insights for robotic well-being coach design and deployment, and contributes to the vision of taking robotic coaches into the real world.

  Drones (micro unmanned aerial vehicles) are becoming more prevalent in applications that bring them into close human spaces. This is made possible in part by clear drone-to-human communication strategies. However current auditory and visual communication methods only work with strict environmental settings. To continue expanding the possibilities for drones to be useful in human spaces we explore ways to overcome these limitations through physical touch. We present a new application for drones–physical instructive feedback. To do this we designed three different physical interaction modes for a drone. We then conducted a user study (N=12) to answer fundamental questions of where and how people want to physically interact with drones and what people naturally infer the physical touch is communicating. We then used these insights to conduct a second user study (N=14) to understand the best way for a drone to communicate instructions to a human in a movement task. We found that continuous physical feedback is both the preferred mode and is more effective at providing instruction than incremental feedback.

  To benefit from the social capabilities of a robot math tutor instead of being distracted by them a novel approach is needed where the math task and the robot’s social behaviors are better intertwined. We present concrete design specifications of how children can practice math via a personal conversation with a social robot and how the robot can scaffold instructions. We evaluated the designs with a three-session experimental user study (n = 130, 8-11 y.o.). Participants got better at math over time when the robot scaffolded instructions. Furthermore, the robot felt more as a friend when it personalized the conversation.

  Social robots are becoming important agents in several sectors of people’s lives. They can act in different contexts, e.g., public spaces, schools, and homes. Operating, programming and interacting with these robots will be an essential skill in the future. We present a qualitative and explorative study on how family members collaboratively learn (co-learn) about social robots at their homes. Our one-month in the wild study took place at homes of eight families (N=32) in Finland. We defined a novel model for co-learning about and with a social robot at home, Robocamp. In Robocamp, Alpha Mini robot was introduced and left within the families, who were then provided with weekly robotic challenges to be conducted with the robot. The research data was collected by semi-structured interviews and online diaries. This study provides novel insights about family-based co-learning with social robots in the home context. It also offers recommendations for implementing family-based co-learning with social robots at homes.  

 A Social Robot Reading Partner for Explorative Guidance

  Pedagogical agent research has yielded fruitful results in both academic skill learning and meta-cognitive skill acquisition often studied in instructional or peer-to-peer paradigms. In the past decades child-centric pedagogical research which emphasizes the learner’s active participation in learning with self-motivation, curiosity, and exploration, has attracted scholarly attention. Studies show that combining child-driven pedagogy with appropriate adult guidance leads to efficient learning and a strengthened feeling of self-efficacy. However research on using social robots for guidance in child-driven learning still remains open and under-explored. In our study, we focus on children’ s exploration as the vehicle in literacy learning and develop a social robot companion that provides guidance to encourage and motivate children to explore during a storybook reading interaction. To investigate the effect of the robot’s explorative guidance, we compare it against a control condition in which children have full autonomy to explore and read the storybooks. We conduct a between-subjects study with 31 children aged 4 to 6, and the result shows that children who receive explorative guidance from the social robot exhibit a growing trend of self-exploration. Further, children’ s self-exploration in the explorative guidance condition is found correlated to their learning outcome. We conclude the study with recommendations for designing social agents to guide children’s exploration and future research directions in child-centric AI-assisted pedagogy.  

 Towards Modeling and Influencing the Dynamics of Human Learning

  Humans have internal models of robots (like their physical capabilities), the world (like what will happen next), and their tasks (like a preferred goal). However human internal models are not always perfect: for example it is easy to underestimate a robot’s inertia. Nevertheless, these models change and improve over time as humans gather more experience. Interestingly, robot actions influence what this experience is, and therefore influence how people’ s internal models change. In this work we take a step towards enabling robots to understand the influence they have leverage it to better assist people and help human models more quickly align with reality. Our key idea is to model the human’s learning as a nonlinear dynamical system which evolves the human’ s internal model given new observations. We formulate a novel optimization problem to infer the human’s learning dynamics from demonstrations that naturally exhibit human learning. We then formalize how robots can influence human learning by embedding the human’ s learning dynamics model into the robot planning problem. Although our formulations provide concrete problem statements they are intractable to solve in full generality. We contribute an approximation that sacrifices the complexity of the human internal models we can represent but enables robots to learn the nonlinear dynamics of these internal models. We evaluate our inference and planning methods in a suite of simulated environments and an in-person user study where a 7DOF robotic arm teaches participants to be better teleoperators. While influencing human learning remains an open problem our results demonstrate that this influence is possible and can be helpful in real human-robot interaction.

  The perception of audiovisual speech plays an important role in infants’ first language acquisition and continues to be important for language understanding beyond infancy. Beyond that, the perception of speech and congruent lip motion supports language understanding for adults, and it has been suggested that second language learning benefits from audiovisual speech, as it helps learners distinguish speech sounds in the target language. In this paper, we study whether congruent audiovisual speech on a robot facilitates the learning of Japanese pronunciation. 27 native-Dutch speaking participants were trained in Japanese pronunciation by a social robot. The robot demonstrated 30 Japanese words of varying complexity using either congruent audiovisual speech, incongruent visual speech, or computer-generated audiovisual speech. Participants were asked to imitate the robot’ s pronunciation recordings of which were rated by native Japanese speakers. Against expectation the results showed that congruent audiovisual speech resulted in lower pronunciation performance than low-fidelity or incongruent speech. We show that our learners being native Dutch speakers are only very weakly sensitive to audiovisual Japanese speech which possibly explains why learning performance does not seem to benefit from audiovisual speech.  

 I Learn Better Alone !: Collaborative and Individual Word Learning With a Child and Adult Robot   
 Alireza M. Kamelabad 
  Gabriel Skantze 
  The use of social robots as a tool for language learning has been studied quite extensively recently. Although their effectiveness and comparison with other technologies are well studied the effects of the robot’s appearance and the interaction setting have received less attention. As educational robots are envisioned to appear in household or school environments, it is important to investigate how their designed persona or interaction dynamics affect learning outcomes. In such environments, children may do the activities together or alone or perform them in the presence of an adult or another child. In this regard, we have identified two novel factors to investigate: the robot’ s perceived age (adult or child) and the number of learners interacting with the robot simultaneously (one or two). We designed an incidental word learning card game with the Furhat robot and ran a between-subject experiment with 75 middle school participants. We investigated the interactions and effects of children’s word learning outcomes, speech activity, and perception of the robot’ s role. The results show that children who played alone with the robot had better word retention and anthropomorphized the robot more compared to those who played in pairs. Furthermore unlike previous findings from human-human interactions children did not show different behaviors in the presence of a robot designed as an adult or a child. We discuss these factors in detail and make a novel contribution to the direct comparison of collaborative versus individual learning and the new concept of the robot’s age.

  Social robots are becoming increasingly prevalent in the real world. Unsupervised user interactions in a natural and familiar setting such as the home can reveal novel design insights and opportunities. This paper presents an analysis and key design insights from family-robot interactions captured via on-robot recordings during an unsupervised four-week in-home deployment of an autonomous reading companion robot for children. We analyzed interviews and 160 interaction videos involving six families who regularly interacted with a robot for four weeks. Throughout these interactions we observed how the robot’s expressions facilitated unique interactions with the child, as well as how family members interacted with the robot. In conclusion, we discuss five design opportunities derived from our analysis of natural interactions in the wild.

 Would You Help Me?: Linking Robot’s Perspective-Taking to Human Prosocial Behavior   
 João Tiago Almeida 
  Iolanda Leite 
  Elmira Yadollahi 
  Despite the growing literature on human attitudes toward robots particularly prosocial behavior little is known about how robots’ perspective-taking, the capacity to perceive and understand the world from other viewpoints, could influence such attitudes and perceptions of the robot. To make robots and AI more autonomous and self-aware, more researchers have focused on developing cognitive skills such as perspective-taking and theory of mind in robots and AI. The present study investigated whether a robot’ s perspective-taking choices could influence the occurrence and extent of exhibiting prosocial behavior toward the robot. We designed an interaction consisting of a perspective-taking task where we manipulated how the robot instructs the human to find objects by changing its frame of reference and measured the human’s exhibition of prosocial behavior toward the robot. In a between-subject study (N=70), we compared the robot’ s egocentric and addressee-centric instructions against a control condition where the robot’s instructions were object-centric. Participants’ prosocial behavior toward the robot was measured using a voluntary data collection session. Our results imply that the occurrence and extent of prosocial behavior toward the robot were significantly influenced by the robot’s visuospatial perspective-taking behavior. Furthermore, we observed, through questionnaire responses, that the robot’ s choice of perspective-taking could potentially influence the humans’ perspective choices, were they to reciprocate the instructions to the robot.  

 Self-Annotation Methods for Aligning Implicit and Explicit Human Feedback in Human-Robot Interaction

  Recent research in robot learning suggests that implicit human feedback is a low-cost approach to improving robot behavior without the typical teaching burden on users. Because implicit feedback can be difficult to interpret though we study different methods to collect fine-grained labels from users about robot performance across multiple dimensions which can then serve to map implicit human feedback to performance values. In particular we focused on understanding the effects of annotation order and frequency on human perceptions of the self-annotation process and the usefulness of the labels for creating data-driven models to reason about implicit feedback. Our results demonstrate that different annotation methods can influence perceived memory burden annotation difficulty and overall annotation time. Based on our findings we conclude with recommendations to create future implicit feedback datasets in Human-Robot Interaction.

  Service robots have increasingly been investigated in retailing. Previous studies mainly focused on the effectiveness of recommendation with regard to a single robot and whether and how the use of two robots combined can achieve better performance remain unclear. In this study we address this by exploring the combination power of two service robots for product recommendation in a bakery. We placed one robot inside the store for product recommendation and the other robot outside to promote the inside robot. Particularly we are interested in the effects of the outside robot on the inside robot’s performance in product recommendation. Our results indicate that using the outside robot to promote the inside robot achieved more purchases over using the inside robot alone. Particularly, we discovered that the outside robot increased the attention of customers toward the inside robot; hence, more customers checked and purchased the products. Based on the findings, we discuss the important points for the effective use of service robots.  

 Hey?: ! What did you think about that Robot? Groups Polarize Users’ Acceptance and Trust of Food Delivery Robots

  As food delivery robots are spreading onto streets and college campuses worldwide users’ views of these robots will depend on their direct and indirect interactions with the robots and their conversations with other people, such as those with whom they are ordering food via a robot. We examined if being in a group of 2 to 3 people affects the acceptance and trust of the robot compared to being an individual user. First-time users of the food delivery robot service (N = 60) ordered food either as an Individual or in a Group. We measured the acceptance and trust of the robots after three Exposures (pre-exposure, after ordering food on the app, and after the robots delivered the food). Results indicated that Individual users had more acceptance and trust compared to Group users. Further, as hypothesized, groups had more variation in acceptance and trust compared to individual users, consistent with patterns of group polarization i.e., group members influencing each other’ s perceptions to become more positive or negative. Further analysis demonstrated that group members were highly influenced by their groupmates. Designers and restaurant operators should consider how to enhance group members’ experience of delivery robots.

  This study focused on investigating the content structure and predictors of robots’ stereotypes. We involved 120 participants in an online study and asked them to rate 80 robots on communion, agency, suitability for female and suitability for male tasks. In line with the stereotype content model, we discovered that robots’ stereotypes are described by two dimensions communion and agency which combine to form univalent (e.g., low communion/low agency), as well as ambivalent clusters (e.g., low communion/high agency). Moreover we found out that a robot’s stereotypical appearance has a role in activating stereotypes. Indeed, in our study, female robots featuring appearance cues socio-culturally associated with femininity (e.g., eyelashes or apparel) were perceived as more communal, and juvenile robots featuring appearance cues tapping into the baby schema (e.g., cartoony eyes) were perceived as more communal, less agentic, and less suited to perform tasks. Given the renowned relationship between stereotyping, prejudice and discrimination, the causal link between appearance and stereotyping we establish in this paper can help HRI researchers disentangle the relation between robots’ design and people’s behavioral tendencies towards them, including proneness to harm.  

 A Picture Might Be Worth a Thousand Words But It’s Not Always Enough to Evaluate Robots   
 Natasha Randall 
  Selma Sabanovic 
  Evaluation of robots commonly occurs using various stimuli including photos videos and live interaction. However a better understanding of how and why chosen stimuli affect perceptions and how evaluations using lower fidelity media (e.g. photos) compare to evaluations using higher context stimuli (e.g., videos), is needed. Through a survey of 599 M-Turk participants we compare robot evaluations based on exposure to three types of media – photos GIFs and promotional videos. We analyze nine perception and behavioral intention measures of three home robots with varying levels of anthropomorphism (Olly, Jibo, and Liku): overall liking liking of appearance liking of intended use eeriness human-likeness performance expectations privacy concerns information seeking intention and purchase intention. We find that photos consistently differ from ratings of videos for all measures except for liking of robots’ intended use. Use of GIFs led to measurements in line with videos for seven of the nine measurements, due to the importance of movement in perceptual assessments and character judgments (e.g., friendly, creepy). Except for the most human-like robot, neither photos nor GIFs captured human-likeness to a similar degree as videos, due to the importance of speech in assessments. Though GIFs captured informational and overall privacy concerns well, they did not adequately capture physical privacy concerns.  

 Increasing Perceived Safety in Motion Planning for Human-Drone Interaction

  Safety is crucial for autonomous drones to operate close to humans. Besides avoiding unwanted or harmful contact people should also perceive the drone as safe. Existing safe motion planning approaches for autonomous robots such as drones have primarily focused on ensuring physical safety e.g., by imposing constraints on motion planners. However studies indicate that ensuring physical safety does not necessarily lead to perceived safety. Prior work in Human-Drone Interaction (HDI) shows that factors such as the drone’s speed and distance to the human are important for perceived safety. Building on these works, we propose a parameterized control barrier function (CBF) that constrains the drone’ s maximum deceleration and minimum distance to the human and update its parameters on people’s ratings of perceived safety. We describe an implementation and evaluation of our approach. Results of a within-subject user study (N=15) show that we can improve perceived safety of a drone by adjusting to people individually.  

 Effects of Human-Swarm Interaction on Subjective Time Perception: Swarm Size and Speed

  Many large-scale multi-robot systems require human input during operation in different applications. To still minimize the human effort interaction is intermittent or restricted to a subset of robots. Despite this reduced demand for human interaction the mental load and stress can be challenging for the human operator. A specific effect of human-swarm interaction may be a hypothesized change of subjective time perception in the human operator. In a series of simple human-swarm interaction experiments with robot swarms of up to 15 physical robots we study whether human operators have altered time perception due to the number of controlled robots or robot speeds. Using data gathered by questionnaires we found that increased swarm size shrinks perceived time and decreased robot speeds expand the perceived time. We introduce the concept of subjective time perception to human-swarm interaction. Future research will enable swarm systems to autonomously modulate subjective timing to ease the job of human operators.

 Transformers and Human-robot Interaction for Delirium Detection   
 Joe Jeffcock 
  Mark Hansen 
  Virginia Ruiz Garate 
  An estimated 20% of patients admitted to hospital wards are affected by delirium. Early detection is recommended to treat underlying causes of delirium however workforce strain in general wards often causes it to remain undetected. This work proposes a robotic implementation of the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) to aid early detection of delirium. Interactive features of the assessment are performed by Human-robot Interaction while a Transformer-based deep learning model predicts the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) level of the patient from image sequences; thermal imaging is used to maintain patient anonymity. A user study involving 18 participants role-playing each of alert agitated and sedated levels of the RASS is performed to test the HRI components and collect a dataset for deep learning. The HRI system achieved accuracies of 1.0 and 0.833 for the inattention and disorganised thinking features of the CAM-ICU respectively while the trained action recognition model achieved a mean accuracy of 0.852 on the classification of RASS levels during cross-validation. The three features represent a complete set of capabilities for automated delirium detection using the CAM-ICU and the results demonstrate the feasibility of real-world deployment in hospital general wards.  

 Reimagining Robots for Dementia: From Robots for Care-receivers/giver to Robots for Carepartners

  Informal caregivers are the main source of dementia care. Considering the importance of both family caregivers and persons living with dementia (PwDs), this paper explores how these two parties go through their dementia journey and how they envision robots to support them. We adopt a person-centered care approach which views these couples as reciprocal carepartners rather than as care-givers and care-receivers. We conducted a community-based participatory research study with a dementia advocacy organization to imagine how robots can support these dementia dyads. The contribution of this paper is threefold: First we introduce a person-centered care approach and show how this new approach reveals the issues of PwDs and carepartners (CPs) as partners and citizens. For example PwDs’ main challenges were not dementia symptoms but the concomitant stigma such as fears of being considered abnormal. This issue has rarely been discussed in HRI. Second, we suggest slow communication as an important robot design feature. When robots can wait for PwDs to proceed with information without judging PwDs’ relatively slow response PwDs feel respected and less stigmatized. Third we address the importance of paying attention to disagreements between PwDs and CPs about robot design preferences. Considering the interdependency of the two parties robot design processes should allow the two to negotiate.

  Social support plays a crucial role in managing and enhancing one’s mental health and well-being. In order to explore the role of a robot’ s companion-like behavior on its therapeutic interventions we conducted an eight-week-long deployment study with seventy participants to compare the impact of (1) acontrol robot with only assistant-like skills, (2) acoach-like robot with additional instructive positive psychology interventions and (3) acompanion-like robot that delivered the same interventions in a peer-like and supportive manner. The companion-like robot was shown to be the most effective in building a positive therapeutic alliance with people enhancing participants’ well-being and readiness for change. Our work offers valuable insights into how companion AI agents could further enhance the efficacy of the mental health interventions by strengthening their therapeutic alliance with people for long-term mental health support.  

 Robot Uninterrupted: Telemedical Robots to Mitigate Care Disruption

  Emergency department (ED) healthcare workers (HCWs) are interrupted as often as once every six minutes increasing the risk of errors and preventable patient harm. As more robots enter hospitals and the ED they must support HCWs in managing interruptions and ideally mitigate their harmful effects without disrupting ED communication. However interruption-mitigation strategies particularly for mobile telemanipulator robots (MTRs), are not well understood. In this work we explore interruption-mitigation and reorientation methods for MTRs in the ED. We conducted a study where ED HCWs teleoperated an MTR in a realistic hospital simulation environment. Our findings revealed insights on how MTRs might support multitasking in environments with frequent task switching and the place of autonomy in safety-critical spaces. Conflicting opinions about the appropriateness of different MTR behaviors highlighted challenges and ethical dilemmas that influence the integration of MTRs in the ED. This work will support the implementation of interruption-mitigation strategies on MTRs enabling them to better support people in fast-paced interruption-driven environments thus reducing the risk of errors in these situations.  

 Co-Designing with Older Adults for Older Adults: Robots to Promote Physical Activity

  Lack of physical activity has severe negative health consequences for older adults and limits their ability to live independently. Robots have been proposed to help engage older adults in physical activity (PA), albeit with limited success. There is a lack of robust understanding of older adults’ needs and wants from robots designed to engage them in PA. In this paper, we report on the findings of a co-design process where older adults, physical therapy experts, and engineers designed robots to promote PA in older adults. We found a variety of motivators for and barriers against PA in older adults; we, then, conceptualized a broad spectrum of possible robotic support and found that robots can play various roles to help older adults engage in PA. This exploratory study elucidated several overarching themes and emphasized the need for personalization and adaptability. This work highlights key design features that researchers and engineers should consider when developing robots to engage older adults in PA, and underscores the importance of involving various stakeholders in the design and development of assistive robots.

  Mindfulness-based therapies have been shown to be effective in improving mental health and technology-based methods have the potential to expand the accessibility of these therapies. To enable real-time personalized content generation for mindfulness practice in these methods high-quality computer-synthesized text-to-speech (TTS) voices are needed to provide verbal guidance and respond to user performance and preferences. However the user-perceived quality of state-of-the-art TTS voices has not yet been evaluated for administering mindfulness meditation which requires emotional expressiveness. In addition work has not yet been done to study the effect of physical embodiment and personalization on the user-perceived quality of TTS voices for mindfulness. To that end we designed a two-phase human subject study. In Phase 1 an online Mechanical Turk between-subject study (N=471) evaluated 3 (feminine, masculine, child-like) state-of-the-art TTS voices with 2 (feminine, masculine) human therapists’ voices in 3 different physical embodiment settings (no agent, conversational agent, socially assistive robot) with remote participants. Building on findings from Phase 1, in Phase 2, an in-person within-subject study (N=94), we used a novel framework we developed for personalizing TTS voices based on user preferences, and evaluated user-perceived quality compared to best-rated non-personalized voices from Phase 1. We found that the best-rated human voice was perceived better than all TTS voices; the emotional expressiveness and naturalness of TTS voices were poorly rated, while users were satisfied with the clarity of TTS voices. Surprisingly, by allowing users to fine-tune TTS voice features, the user-personalized TTS voices could perform almost as well as human voices suggesting user personalization could be a simple and very effective tool to improve user-perceived quality of TTS voice.

  One important aspect of effective human–robot collaborations is the ability for robots to adapt quickly to the needs of humans. While techniques like deep reinforcement learning have demonstrated success as sophisticated tools for learning robot policies the fluency of human-robot collaborations is often limited by these policies’ inability to integrate changes to a user’ s preferences for the task. To address these shortcomings we propose a novel approach that can modify learned policies at execution time via symbolic if-this-then-that rules corresponding to a modular and superimposable set of low-level constraints on the robot’s policy. These rules, which we call Transparent Matrix Overlays, function not only as succinct and explainable descriptions of the robot’ s current strategy but also as an interface by which a human collaborator can easily alter a robot’s policy via verbal commands. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on a series of proof-of-concept cooking tasks performed in simulation and on a physical robot.

  With an aging population and a growing shortage of caregivers the need for in-home robots is increasing. However it is intractable for robots to have all functionalities pre-programmed prior to deployment. Instead it is more realistic for robots to engage in supplemental on-site learning about the user’s needs and preferences. Such learning may occur in the presence of or involve the user. We investigate the impacts on end-users of in situ robot learning through a series of human-subjects experiments. We examine how different learning methods influence both in-person and remote participants’ perceptions of the robot. While we find that the degree of user involvement in the robot’s learning method impacts perceived anthropomorphism (p=.001), we find that it is the participants’ perceived success of the robot that impacts the participants’ trust in (p<.001) and perceived usability of the robot (p<.001) rather than the robot’ s learning method. Therefore when presenting robot learning the performance of the learning method appears more important than the degree of user involvement in the learning. Furthermore we find that the physical presence of the robot impacts perceived safety (p< .001), trust (p< .001), and usability (p< .014). Thus for tabletop manipulation tasks researchers should consider the impact of physical presence on experiment participants.  

 Multiperspective Teaching of Unknown Objects via Shared-gaze-based Multimodal Human-Robot Interaction

  Wolfgang Fuhl 
  Enkelejda Kasneci 
  Andreas Zell 
  For successful deployment of robots in multifaceted situations an understanding of the robot for its environment is indispensable. With advancing performance of state-of-the-art object detectors the capability of robots to detect objects within their interaction domain is also enhancing. However it binds the robot to a few trained classes and prevents it from adapting to unfamiliar surroundings beyond predefined scenarios. In such scenarios humans could assist robots amidst the overwhelming number of interaction entities and impart the requisite expertise by acting as teachers. We propose a novel pipeline that effectively harnesses human gaze and augmented reality in a human-robot collaboration context to teach a robot novel objects in its surrounding environment. By intertwining gaze (to guide the robot’s attention to an object of interest) with augmented reality (to convey the respective class information) we enable the robot to quickly acquire a significant amount of automatically labeled training data on its own. Training in a transfer learning fashion, we demonstrate the robot’ s capability to detect recently learned objects and evaluate the influence of different machine learning models and learning procedures as well as the amount of training data involved. Our multimodal approach proves to be an efficient and natural way to teach the robot novel objects based on a few instances and allows it to detect classes for which no training dataset is available. In addition, we make our dataset publicly available to the research community, which consists of RGB and depth data, intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters, along with regions of interest.  

 People Dynamically Update Trust When Interactively Teaching Robots   
 Vivienne Bihe Chi 
  Bertram F. Malle 
  Human-robot trust research often measures people’s trust in robots in individual scenarios. However, humans may update their trust dynamically as they continuously interact with a robot. In a well-powered study (n = 220), we investigate the trust updating process across a 15-trial interaction. In a novel paradigm participants act in the role of teacher to a simulated robot on a smartphone-based platform, and we assess trust at multiple levels (momentary trust feelings, perceptions of trustworthiness, and intended reliance). Results reveal that people are highly sensitive to the robot’ s learning progress trial by trial: they take into account both previous-task performance, current-task difficulty, and cumulative learning across training. More integrative perceptions of robot trustworthiness steadily grow as people gather more evidence from observing robot performance, especially of faster-learning robots. Intended reliance on the robot in novel tasks increased only for faster-learning robots.  

 SIRL: Similarity-based Implicit Representation Learning   
 Andreea Bobu 
  Yi Liu 
  Rohin Shah 
  Daniel S. Brown 
  Anca D. Dragan 
  When robots learn reward functions using high capacity models that take raw state directly as input, they need to both learn a representation for what matters in the task — the task “features” — as well as how to combine these features into a single objective. If they try to do both at once from input designed to teach the full reward function, it is easy to end up with a representation that contains spurious correlations in the data, which fails to generalize to new settings. Instead, our ultimate goal is to enable robots to identify and isolate the causal features that people actually care about and use when they represent states and behavior. Our idea is that we can tune into this representation by asking users what behaviors they consider similar: behaviors will be similar if the features that matter are similar, even if low-level behavior is different; conversely, behaviors will be different if even one of the features that matter differs. This, in turn, is what enables the robot to disambiguate between what needs to go into the representation versus what is spurious, as well as what aspects of behavior can be compressed together versus not. The notion of learning representations based on similarity has a nice parallel in contrastive learning, a self-supervised representation learning technique that maps visually similar data points to similar embeddings, where similarity is defined by a designer through data augmentation heuristics. By contrast, in order to learn the representations that people use, so we can learn their preferences and objectives, we use their definition of similarity. In simulation as well as in a user study, we show that learning through such similarity queries leads to representations that, while far from perfect, are indeed more generalizable than self-supervised and task-input alternatives.  

 Transfer Learning of Human Preferences for Proactive Robot Assistance in Assembly Tasks

  We focus on enabling robots to proactively assist humans in assembly tasks by adapting to their preferred sequence of actions. Much work on robot adaptation requires human demonstrations of the task. However, human demonstrations of real-world assemblies can be tedious and time-consuming. Thus, we propose learning human preferences from demonstrations in a shorter, canonical task to predict user actions in the actual assembly task. The proposed system uses the preference model learned from the canonical task as a prior and updates the model through interaction when predictions are inaccurate. We evaluate the proposed system in simulated assembly tasks and in a real-world human-robot assembly study and we show that both transferring the preference model from the canonical task, as well as updating the model online, contribute to improved accuracy in human action prediction. This enables the robot to proactively assist users, significantly reduce their idle time, and improve their experience working with the robot, compared to a reactive robot.

  Service robots for personal use in the home and the workplace require end-user development solutions for swiftly scripting robot tasks as the need arises. Many existing solutions preserve ease, efficiency, and convenience through simple programming interfaces or by restricting task complexity. Others facilitate meticulous task design but often do so at the expense of simplicity and efficiency. There is a need for robot programming solutions that reconcile the complexity of robotics with the on-the-fly goals of end-user development. In response to this need, we present a novel, multimodal, and on-the-fly development system Tabula. Inspired by a formative design study with a prototype, Tabula leverages a combination of spoken language for specifying the core of a robot task and sketching for contextualizing the core. The result is that developers can script partial, sloppy versions of robot programs to be completed and refined by a program synthesizer. Lastly, we demonstrate our anticipated use cases of Tabula via a set of application scenarios.

  Robots designed to interact with people in collaborative or social scenarios must move in ways that are consistent with the robot’s task and communication goals. However, combining these goals in a naïve manner can result in mutually exclusive solutions, or infeasible or problematic states and actions. In this paper, we present Lively, a framework which supports configurable, real-time, task-based and communicative or socially-expressive motion for collaborative and social robotics across multiple levels of programmatic accessibility. Lively supports a wide range of control methods (i.e. position, orientation, and joint-space goals), and balances them with complex procedural behaviors for natural, lifelike motion that are effective in collaborative and social contexts. We discuss the design of three levels of programmatic accessibility of Lively, including a graphical user interface for visual design called LivelyStudio, the core library Lively for full access to its capabilities for developers, and an extensible architecture for greater customizability and capability.  

 Nudging or Waiting?: Automatically Synthesized Robot Strategies for Evacuating Noncompliant Users in an Emergency Situation

  Robots have the potential to assist in emergency evacuation tasks, but it is not clear how robots should behave to evacuate people who are not fully compliant, perhaps due to panic or other priorities in an emergency. In this paper, we compare two robot strategies: an actively nudging robot that initiates evacuation and pulls toward the exit and a passively waiting robot that stays around users and waits for instruction. Both strategies were automatically synthesized from a description of the desired behavior. We conduct a within participant study (=20) in a simulated environment to compare the evacuation effectiveness between the two robot strategies. Our results indicate an advantage of the nudging robot for effective evacuation when being exposed to the evacuation scenario for the first time. The waiting robot results in lower efficiency, higher mental load, and more physical conflicts. However, participants like the waiting robots equally or slightly more when they repeat the evacuation scenario and are more familiar with the situation. Our qualitative analysis of the participants’ feedback suggests several design implications for future emergency evacuation robots.

 The Eye of the Robot Beholder: Ethical Risks of Representation, Recognition, and Reasoning over Identity Characteristics in Human-Robot Interaction   
 Tom Williams 
  Significant segments of the HRI literature rely on or promote the ability to reason about human identity characteristics, including age, gender, and cultural background. However, attempting to handle identity characteristics raises a number of critical ethical concerns, especially given the spatiotemporal dynamics of these characteristics. In this paper I question whether human identity characteristics can and should be represented, recognized, or reasoned about by robots, with special attention paid to the construct of race due to its relative lack of consideration within the HRI community. As I will argue, while there are a number of well-warranted reasons why HRI researchers might want to enable robotic consideration of identity characteristics, these reasons are outweighed by a number of key ontological, perceptual, and deployment-oriented concerns. This argument raises troubling questions as to whether robots should even be able to understand or generate descriptions of people, and how they would do so while avoiding these ethical concerns. Finally, I conclude with a discussion of what this means for the HRI community, in terms of both algorithm and robot design, and speculate as to possible paths forward.  

 How Did We Miss This?: A Case Study on Unintended Biases in Robot Social Behavior   
 Maria Teresa Parreira 
  Sarah Gillet 
  Katie Winkle 
  Iolanda Leite 
  With societies growing more and more conscious of human social biases that are implicit in most of our interactions, the development of automated robot social behavior is failing to address these issues as more than just an afterthought. In the present work, we describe how we unintentionally implemented robot listener behavior that was biased toward the gender of the participants, while following typical design procedures in the field. In a post-hoc analysis of data collected in a between-subject user study (n=60), we find that both a rule-based and a deep learning-based listener behavior models produced a higher number of backchannels (listener feedback, through nodding or vocal utterances) if the participant identified as a male. We investigate the cause of this bias in both models and discuss the implications of our findings. Further, we provide approaches that may be taken to address the issue of algorithmic fairness, and preventative measures to avoid the development of biased social robot behavior.  

 Borrowing Poking and Entangling. In Search of Shared Spaces Between Science and Technology Studies and Human-Robot Interaction   
 Anna Dobrosovestnova 
  Jesse de Pagter 
  Astrid Weiss 
  In this paper, we reflect on the disciplinary foundations and dominant practices in the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) from the perspective of our own experience of working interdisciplinarily and drawing on colleagues’ ongoing work that transcends disciplinary boundaries. As a part of this reflection, we explore possibilities for the field’s theoretical and methodological expansion, which we contend is needed, given the rapid expansion of robotic technologies in the real world settings. We argue the field of science and technology studies (STS) can be a valuable collaborator and contributor in the process of negotiating disciplinary boundaries of HRI and advancing the field beyond common narratives of technological solutionism and determinism. We frame STS as a field with a strong tradition of studying social and political embeddedness of science and technology, and how these are co-constitutive and co-emergent. STS also investigates the roles and responsibility different actors share in this process. To further explore how the interfacing between STS and HRI can be enacted, we sketch out three modes of interdisciplinary collaboration we call i) Borrowing, ii) Poking and iii) Entangling. We argue that each of these modes comes with advantages, disadvantages and challenges. In the conclusion, we engage the notions of “thinking with care” and disciplinary reflexivity, as an invitation to fellow scholars to consider which disciplinary assumptions are brought to the table when enacting different modes of interfacing between HRI and STS, and how these are entangled with the goals and (desired) outcomes of research practices.  

 Nature-Robot Interaction   
 Pedro Reynolds-Cuéllar 
  Andrés F. Salazar-Gómez 
  Up until now, Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has been largely defined by the influences both humans and robots exert on each other across various interaction modes. Robots follow human purpose and serve goals determined by humans with various degrees of agency. Humans act, respond, and adapt to robot behaviors while simultaneously advancing technology to increase robot’s affordances. Abstracted by this dyad, HRI has left out the material background making this exchange possible: Nature. The current planetary crisis forces us to reconsider the importance of contextualizing HRI within a larger picture, and invites us to ask ourselves how this relationship can be better served by considering Nature as the driving agent in this binary relationship. In response to this reflection, we present a first attempt of a speculative paradigm in HRI: Nature-Robot Interaction. We discuss ethical and design underpinnings of this approach to HRI, introduce initial guiding principles, as well as examples of potential affordances, embodiments and interactions. While we begin in the realm of the speculative and recognize the infancy of our proposal, we invite the HRI community to it as a serious design principle moving forward.  

 Creative AI for HRI Design Explorations   
 Marius Hoggenmueller 
  Maria Luce Lupetti 
  Willem van der Maden 
  Kazjon Grace 
  Design fixation, a phenomenon describing designers’ adherence to pre-existing ideas or concepts that constrain design outcomes, is particularly prevalent in human-robot interaction (HRI), for example, due to collectively held and stabilised imaginations of what a robot should look like or behave. In this paper, we explore the contribution of creative AI tools to overcome design fixation and enhance creative processes in HRI design. In a four weeks long design exploration, we used generative text-to-image models to ideate and visualise robotic artefacts and robot sociotechnical imaginaries. We exchanged results along with reflections through a digital postcard format. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach to imagining novel robot concepts, surfacing existing assumptions and robot stereotypes, and situating robotic artefacts in context. We discuss the contribution to designerly HRI practices and conclude with lessons learnt for using creative AI tools as an emerging design practice in HRI research and beyond.  

 Dancing with the Nonhuman: A Feminist, Embodied, Material Inquiry into the Making of Human-Robot Relationships   
 Petra Gemeinboeck 
  Rob Saunders 
  We propose that feminist reconceptualisations of agency and difference could dramatically expand our possibilities for both relating to robots in social scenarios and designing them as social agents. A performative approach to human-robot interaction favors the artefact’s relational, participatory capacities over representational attributes to explore the meaning-making potential of human-machine couplings rather than the predefined meaning of an individual robotic agent. We discuss the feminist concepts of intra-action and diffraction and explore how they could expand our understanding of the workings of the interference patterns that characterize human-robot relationships. Our collaborative Machine Movement Lab project serves as a case study to look at the situated enactment of the subjects and objects that shape our human-robot relationships through the embodied lens of performance-making.

  Nowadays, telepresence systems based on the Extended Reality (XR) system are actively developed and used for remote collaboration due to COVID-19. Still, several issues, such as limited traversable space in Virtual Reality (VR) and require all participants to wear head-mounted display (HMD), stop these systems from being used in our daily life. On the other hand, telepresence robots have been used in various fields before the pandemic. However, these robots also have a limitation in that the current form is incapable of delivering non-verbal expressions, which is essential for social interaction. Therefore, we present a Holobot, a telepresence robot based on the XR system. A remote user connects to the Holobot through VR HMDs, and the Holobot augments a virtual avatar that projects users’ facial and gesture expressions. We developed a prototype and conducted a simple field test in the exhibition to receive feedback. VR participants enjoyed exploring remote spaces and interacting with each other through Holobot. Furthermore, remote space participants mentioned that a 1:1 scale avatar helped to build co-presence with the VR user. Based on these insights, we think Holobot could provide design guideline for future telepresence robot. For further approach we plan to improve our prototype and conduct user test for structured evaluation of our system.

  The integration of robots as storytellers, game masters or embodied characters into games is a novel technique for game design yet restricted to human-robot interaction (HRI) research. To facilitate the usage of robots, a plugin for a common game engine is needed. NarRobot was developed to provide an easy to use interface and seamless integration of the social robot Reeti into the Unity engine without using third-party materials. Further, it includes an intuitive pose editor. Targeting both HRI research and game development the plugin allows researchers to focus on their actual research instead of fiddling with back-end functionality. It also simplifies the entry into programming robots for games. In this contribution, our plugin is presented alongside with a proof of concept and three use cases focusing on interactivity combination with other services, and multi-platform usage: interactive storytelling, integration into a smart room, and a mobile app for a robotic hotel employee.  

 “Nice to meet you!”: Expressing Emotions with Movement Gestures and Textual Content in Automatic Handwriting Robots

  Ray LC 
  Text-writing robots have been used in assistive writing and drawing applications. However, robots do not convey emotional tones in the writing process due to the lack of behaviors humans typically adopt. To examine how people interpret designed robotic expressions of emotion through both movements and textual output, we used a pen-plotting robot to generate texts by performing human-like behaviors like stop-and-go, speed, and pressure variation. We examined how people convey emotion in the writing process by observing how they wrote in different emotional contexts. We then mapped these human expressions during writing to the handwriting robot and measured how well other participants understood the robot’s affective expression. We found that textual output was the strongest determinant of participants’ ability to perceive the robot’s emotions whereas parameters of gestural movements of the robots like speed, fluency, pressure, size, and acceleration could be useful for understanding the context of the writing expression.  

 Towards Designing Companion Robots with the End in Mind

  This paper presents an early-stage idea of using ‘robot death’ as an integral component of human-robot interaction design for companion robots. Reviewing previous discussions around the deaths of companion robots in real-life and popular culture contexts, and analyzing the lifelike design of current companion robots in the market, the paper explores the potential advantages of designing companion robots and human-robot interaction with their ‘death’ in mind.  

 A Multimodal Teach-in Approach to the Pick-and-Place Problem in Human-Robot Collaboration

  Michael Feld 
  Teaching robotic systems how to carry out a task in a collaborative environment still presents a challenge. This is because replicating natural human-to-human interaction requires the availability of interaction modalities that allow conveying complex information. Speech, gestures, gaze-based interactions as well as directly guiding a robotic system count towards such modalities that yield the potential to enable smooth multimodal human-robot interaction. This paper presents a conceptual approach for multimodally teaching a robotic system how to pick-and-place an object, one of the fundamental tasks not only in robotics, but in everyday life. By establishing task and dialogue model separately, we aim to split robot/task logic from interaction logic and to achieve modality independence for the teaching interaction. Finally, we elaborate on an experimental implementation of our models for multimodally teaching a UR-10 robot arm how to pick-and-place an object.  

 Robotic Coaches Delivering Group Mindfulness Practice at a Public Cafe

  Group meditation is known to keep people motivated and committed over longer periods of time, as compared to individual practice. Robotic coaching is a promising avenue for engaging people in group meditation and mindfulness exercises. However, the deployment of robotic coaches to deliver group mindfulness sessions in real-world settings is very scarce. We present the first steps in deploying a robotic mindfulness coach at a public cafe, where participants could join robot-led meditation sessions in a group setting. We conducted two studies with two robotic coaches: the toy-like Misty II robot for 4 weeks (n = 4), and the child-like QTrobot for 3 weeks (n = 3). This paper presents an exploratory qualitative analysis of the data collected via group discussions after the sessions, and researcher observations during the sessions. Additionally, we discuss the lessons learned and future work related to deploying a robotic coach in a real-world group setting.

  Joseph P. Salisbury 
  Intuitive human-robot collaboration requires adaptive modalities for humans and robots to communicate and learn from each other. For diverse teams of humans and robots to naturally collaborate on novel tasks, robots must be able to model roles for themselves and other team members, anticipate how team members may perceive their actions, and communicate back to team members to continuously promote inclusive team cohesion toward achieving a shared goal. Here, we describe a set of tasks for studying mixed multi-human and multi-robot teams with heterogenous roles to achieve joint goals through both voice and gestural interactions. Based around the cooperative game TEAM3, we specify a series of dyadic and triadic human-robot collaboration tasks that require both verbal and nonverbal communication to effectively accomplish. Task materials are inexpensive and provide methods for studying a diverse set of challenges associated with human-robot communication, learning, and perspective-taking.

  In this work we used a dance performance to explore physical human-drone interactions during a collaborative task. We created drone behaviors to allow partnership and increase physicality between the dancer and drone. We found that extended moments of hovering increase the dancer’s perspective of the drone as a partner. We found that using the amount of force exerted from the dancer to the drone is a sufficient input for designing drone responses and increasing the amount of physical contact between the partners.

  Current video conferencing technology allows participants to communicate virtually over distance, but users lack the sense of presence due to the absence of physical cues for interaction. We proposes the design of Gesture-Bot, a DIY telepresence robot that performs pan-and-tilt gestures in the presence of a receiver during video chat. It is command via the web by a remote sender. We conducted a workshop to design and evaluate pan-and-tilt movements with 26 participants in two separate communication scenarios to examine the flow of communication in physical-interactions-assisted remote chat. According to the data collected from the questionnaire and the post-experiment interview, the Gesture-Bot system has shown its potential in assisting remote communications while aspects such as the outlook, the method of controlling the robot, the set of gestures are to be improved in the future.  

 A Methodological Approach to Facilitate the Design of Flexible and Efficient Multi-Application Systems for HRC   
 Omar Elsarha 
  Debora Clever 
  Human-robot collaboration (HRC) can bring immense benefits in terms of working conditions and flexibility in industrial environments. Efficiency benefits can only be realized if validated risk reduction measures ensure human safety. One idea to increase the overall throughput of a robot is to increase the number of possible tasks and the number of potential safety reactions that a robot system can perform. Activating a validated safety configuration based on the environmental status in a safety-rated manner allows for deciding the most efficient task within an assessed setup. This paper proposes a new methodology exploiting this potential with a dual-layer finite state machine. The concept and its potential benefits are showcased using a simplified simulation example.

  The paper proposes a robot learning framework that empowers a robot to automatically generate a sequence of actions from unstructured spoken language. The robot learning framework was able to distinguish between instructions and unrelated conversations. Data were collected from 25 participants, who were asked to instruct the robot to perform a collaborative cooking task while being interrupted and distracted. The system was able to identify the sequence of instructed actions for a cooking task with an accuracy of of 92.85 ± 3.87%.  

 Using a Social Robot as a Hotel Assessment Tool

  This field study investigates the influence of social robots as a hotel assessment tool on hotel ratings. Based on media equation theory, it is assumed that social robots increase quality and quantity of hotel ratings by triggering politeness rules. We developed a robot application that allowed hotel guests to submit ratings on site together with the robot Pepper. Data from robot interactions are compared with data from TrustYou (online rating platform). Results show the potential of social robots as an assessment tool with a trend towards better overall rating when evaluating a hotel on a robot compared to a website.  

 Reactive Planning for Coordinated Handover of an Autonomous Aerial Manipulator

  Rachid Alami 
  In this paper, we present a coordinated and reactive human-aware motion planner for performing a handover task by an autonomous aerial manipulator (AAM). We present a method to determine the final state of the AAM for a handover task based on the current state of the human and the surrounding obstacles. We consider the visual field of the human and the effort to turn the head and see the AAM as well as the discomfort caused to the human. We apply these social constraints together with the kinematic constraints of the AAM to determine its coordinated motion along the trajectory.  

 Who to Teach a Robot to Facilitate Multi-party Social Interactions?   
 Jouh Yeong Chew 
  Keisuke Nakamura 
  One salient function of social robots is to play the role of facilitator to enhance the harmony state of multi-party social interactions so that every human participant is encouraged and motivated to engage actively. However, it is challenging to handcraft the behavior of social robots to achieve this objective. One promising approach is for the robot to learn from human teachers. This paper reports the findings of an empirical test to determine the optimal experiment condition for a robot to learn verbal and nonverbal strategies to facilitate a multi-party interaction. First, the modified L8 Orthogonal Array (OA) is used to design a fractional factorial experiment condition using factors like the type of human facilitator, group size and stimulus type. The response of OA is the harmony state explicitly defined using the speech turn-taking between speakers and represented using metrics extracted from the first order Markov transition matrix. Analyses of Main Effects and ANOVA suggest the type of human facilitator and group size are significant factors affecting the harmony state. Therefore, we propose the optimal experiment condition to train a facilitator robot using high school teachers as human teachers and group size larger than four participants.  

 Human Workload Evaluation of Drone Swarm Formation Control using Virtual Reality Interface   
 Chanun Asavasirikulkij 
  Muhammad Hanif 
  This paper presents experimental data that evaluates the human workload in interacting with a drone swarm using a virtual reality (VR) interface. Formation control algorithm integrated into the system aids a human operator in interacting with the drone swarm. VR head-mounted display (HMD) will help to visualize the swarm enabling teleoperation control. The algorithm will maintain each drone’s position in the formation, making it simple to operate several drones at once. An experiment scenario is proposed to assess the workload using a joystick and a VR controller by moving the drones through a VR HMD. According to the current findings, human could achieve a smoother control with a joystick controller compared to a VR controller. However, a VR controller’s average workload (62.67±30.29) is still twice as high as a joystick controller’s (29.67±12.00) based on the NASA-TLX assessment.

  Social touch, and its recognition and classification, is increasingly important in human-robot interaction. We present a Transformer-based model trained and evaluated on an open-source dataset. The dataset, the Human-Animal Affective Robot Touch (HAART) dataset, was collected for the 2015 Recognition of Touch Gesture Challenge (RTGC 2015) and contains different haptic actions directed at a robotic animal. The actions are recorded using a multi-resolution pressure sensor. We feed the output, containing the touch type to the Nao robot to make the robot sense the touch type. The proposed transformer-based gesture classification model achieved 72.8% classification accuracy in 2.67 seconds, which outperforms the best-submitted algorithm of the RTGC 2015 which has a test classification accuracy of 70.9 % and needed 8 seconds.  

 Intelligent Disobedience: A Novel Approach for Preventing Human Induced Interaction Failures in Robot Teleoperation   
 Kavyaa Somasundaram 
  Andrey Kiselev 
  Amy Loutfi 
  Failures are natural and unavoidable events in any form of interaction, especially in human-robot interactions (HRI). Throughout the literature, the definition and classification of failures are diverse depending on the source and application domain. However, the tolerance to the aftereffect of these failures is low in teleoperation due to its unstructured application domains. One such type of failure is called human induced interaction failure. This is an interesting and often overlooked failure type, due to the perspective that robots are designed always to obey the instructions given by the human operators. Regardless of the degree of automation that the robot is equipped with. But what if the instructions provided are faulty dangerous, or misleading. This paper addresses the above mentioned research gap. It introduces a framework based on the concept of Intelligent Disobedience (ID), derived from guide dog training methods, to manage human induced interaction failures in teleoperation scenarios.

  With smartphones becoming more commonplace in our daily lives, they often take up more time and space than we would like them to. Research shows that using smartphones during social interactions does more harm than good. With this in mind, we set out to create the first prototype of an ambient robotic table that will support social interactions and discourage digital distractions. Through a rapid prototyping process, we present HighLight, a prototype of a socially enabling robotic table that has a smartphone compartment in its center and ambient features reacting in real-time to conversations taking place around the table. We report on our contributions to the research community by investigating the design of an ambient robotic table as a social enabler that encourages social interactions through ambiance, thus exploring future directions of non-disruptive technologies that support social interactions.

  We take initial steps into prototyping an expressive robotic table that can serve as a social mediator. The work is constructed through a rapid prototyping process consisting of five workshop-based phases with five interaction design participants. We report on the various prototyping techniques that led to the generated concept of an expressive robotic table. Our design process explores how expressive motion cues such as respiratory movements can be leveraged to mediate social interactions between people in cold outdoor environments. We conclude by discussing the implications of the different prototyping methods applied and the envisioned future directions of the work within the scope of expressive robotics.  

 Social Robotics meets Sociolinguistics: Investigating Accent Bias and Social Context in HRI   
 Mary Ellen Foster 
  Jane Stuart-Smith 
  Deploying a social robot in the real world means that it must interact with speakers from diverse backgrounds, who in turn are likely to show substantial accent and dialect variation. Linguistic variation in social context has been well studied in human-human interaction; however, the influence of these factors on human interactions with digital agents, especially embodied agents such as robots, has received less attention. Here we present an ongoing project where the goal is to develop a social robot that is suitable for deployment in ethnically-diverse areas with distinctive regional accents. To help in developing this robot, we carried out an online survey of Scottish adults to understand their expectations for conversational interaction with a robot. The results confirm that social factors constraining accent and dialect are likely to be significant issues for human-robot interaction in this context, and so must be taken into account in the design of the system at all levels.  

 Showing Sympathy via Embodied Affective Robot Touch, GIFs, and Texts: People are Indifferent   
 Rachel Hoi Yan Au 
  Katherine M. Tsui 
  Marlena R. Fraune 
  Social touch is important for improving social connection, and it is one method that may improve online communication with people at a distance. In the study, we examined the use of social touch from a robot to convey sympathy, in comparison to merely text or GIFs. Fifty-one pairs of friends entered the lab: one (the recipient) talked about a minor inconvenience, and the other (the giver) comforted their friend using one of the three methods described above. Results indicate that the touching method that we used was not effective for supporting the recipient. Follow-up interviews from five pairs of participants suggest ways to improve robot touch, including customizing touch to individuals, making the robot more biological (e.g., warm), and providing feedback that the touch was received.  

 Human- or Machine-like Music Assistive Robots Effects on Fluency and Memory Recall

  Assistive robots are expected to contribute to the solution of major societal problems in healthcare, such as the increasing number of elderly who need informal and professional care over a long period of time. Most of the research focuses on the development of human-like robots to facilitate human-robot interaction and strengthen the social, cognitive and affective processes. However, there are some possible downsides of this type of “robot humanizing”, like raising high expectations and causing incorrect mental models of the robots. Machine-like robots, on the other hand, may help to build more realistic mental models and expectations but might bring about less fluent interactions and less pronounced experiences (i.e., less to remember). To test if a human-like robot indeed brings about better interaction fluency and memory recall, we designed two types of robots for a joint human-robot music listening activity: A human-like and a machine-like robot (Pepper). Thirty students participated in the experiment managed by a Wizard-of-Oz set-up. As expected, the human-like robot proved to perform better in terms of fluency and memory recall. Currently, we are preparing a follow-up experiment, consisting of longer sessions with the elderly to see whether this effect persists for this age group and how far the human- or machine-likeness influences the elderly’s understanding and expectations of the robot’s capabilities.

  Robots can direct human attention using their eyes. However, it remains unclear whether it is the gaze or the low-level motion of the head rotation that drives attention. We isolated these components in a non-predictive gaze cueing task with a robot to explore how limited robotic signals orient attention. In each trial, the head of a NAO robot turned towards the left or right. To isolate the direction of rotation from its gaze, NAO was presented frontally and backward along blocks. Participants responded faster to targets on the gazed-at site even when the eyes of the robot were not visible and the direction of rotation was opposed to that of the frontal condition. Our results showed that low-level motion did not orient attention, but the gaze direction of the robot did. These findings suggest that the robotic gaze is perceived as a social signal, similar to human gaze.

  Robots could support older adults’ well-being by engaging them in meaningful conversations, specifically to reflect on, support, and improve different aspects of their well-being. We implemented a system on a QT social robot to conduct short autonomous conversations with older adults, to help understand what brings them feelings of joy and meaning in life. We evaluated the system with written surveys and observations of 12 participants including older adults, caregivers, and dementia care staff. From this, we saw the need to improve user experience through personalized interaction that better support older adults as they talk about well-being. Improving the interactions will involve improving the conversation flow, detecting emotions and nonverbal cues, and natural language processing to extract topics around well-being.

  Self-disclosure to a social robot is a mental health intervention that can decrease stress for adolescents. Online digital robots provide the potential to scale this intervention especially in COVID-19 social distancing situations. However, self-disclosure interactions with digital social robots remain relatively unexplored.  
 We conducted two online self-disclosure studies with adolescents (13-19 years old): our Active Listening Study compared experiences sharing positive, negative, and neutral feelings with a social robot, while our Journaling Study explored differences in sharing stressors by speaking with and without a social robot and by writing. We found that positive prompt tone improved mood while neutral prompt decreased stress, and less negative attitudes toward robots correlate with more qualitatively positive experiences with robot interactions. We also found robot disclosure interactions hold promising potential as a preferred method of self-disclosure over solo speaking, moderated by negative attitudes toward robots. This paper outlines limitations and future work from these studies.  

 A Controllable and Repeatable Method to Study Perceptual and Motor Adaptation in Human-Robot Interaction

  Francesco Rea 
  Alessandra Sciutti 
  Human perception and motion are continuously influenced by prior experience. However, when humans have to share the same space and time, different previous experience could lead towards opposite percepts and actions consequently failing in coordination. This study presents a novel experimental setup that aims at exploring the interplay between human perceptual mechanisms and motor strategies during human-robot interaction. To achieve this goal, we developed a complex system to enable the realization of an interactive perceptual task where the participant has to perceive and estimate temporal durations together with iCub, with the goal of coordinating with the robotic partner. Results show that the experimental setup continuously monitor how participants implement their perceptual and motor behavior during the interaction with a controllable interacting agent. Therefore, it will be possible to produce quantitative models describing the interplay between perceptual and motor adaptation during an interaction.  

 Keep your Distance! Assessing Proxemics to Virtual Robots by Caregivers   
 Kim Klüber 
  Linda Onnasch 
  To maintain safety, ensure a positive user experience, and guarantee long-term use, robots must follow the established conventions of caregivers and residents in healthcare settings. To investigate which interpersonal distance conventions are expected from robots in care facilities, caregivers’ perceptions and preferred robot distances were tested in a virtual environment. With a within-design the participants’ position (sitting/standing) and the robot’s speed (0.3/0.8/1.4 m/s) were varied. The slower the robot moved, the shorter the preferred distance of the robot was and the more comfortable and safer caregivers felt. In addition, the robot was allowed to move closer when participants were standing, but no subjective difference was found between sitting and standing conditions. Although control variables did not influence the preferred distances, results suggest that participants’ height becomes relevant at higher speed conditions. This study can be used to derive concrete proximity regulations for the use of robots in care facilities.

  Underwater environments present numerous challenges for marine robots, such as noisy perception, constrained communication, and uncertainty due to wave motion. Human-in-the-loop systems can improve the efficiency and success rate of underwater grasping; however, collecting information in such unstructured environments and accurately presenting it to the operator remains a challenging task. Decision Support Systems (DSSs) can intelligently process and convey information to the operators to facilitate informed decision making. A DSS for autonomous underwater grasping provides visualization capabilities and tools to interact with the available information. Successful initial DSS-assisted underwater grasping was conducted using a six degrees of freedom robotic arm and a depth camera mounted on a mechanical testbed.

  This study proposes a method to estimate pedestrian trust in an automated vehicle (AV) based on pedestrian behavior. It conducted experiments in a VR environment where an AV approached a crosswalk. Participants rated their trust in the AV at three levels before/while they crossed the road. The level can be estimated by deep learning using their skeletal coordinates, position, vehicle position, and speed during the past four seconds. The estimation accuracy was 61%.

  Belonging to a group is a natural need for human beings. Being left out and rejected represents a negative event, which can cause discomfort and stress to the excluded person and other members. Social robots have been shown to have the potential to be optimal tools for studying influence in group interactions, providing valuable insights into how human group dynamics can be modeled, replicated, and leveraged. In this work, we aim to study the effect of being excluded by a social robot in a teenagers-robot interaction. We propose a conversational turn-taking game, inspired by the Cyberball paradigm and rooted in social exclusion mechanisms to explore how the humanoid robot iCub can affect group dynamics by excluding one of the group members. Preliminary results show that the included player tries to re-engage with the one excluded by the robot. We interpret this dynamic as an included player’s tentative to compensate for the exclusion and reestablish a balance, in line with findings in human-human interaction research. Furthermore, the paradigm we developed seems a suitable tool for researching social influence in different Human-Robot Interaction contexts.  

 Can a Robot’s Hand Bias Human Attention?   
 Giulia Scorza Azzarà 
  Joshua Zonca 
  Francesco Rea 
  Joo-Hyun Song 
  Alessandra Sciutti 
  Previous studies have revealed that humans prioritize attention to the space near their hands (the so-called near-hand effect). This effect may also occur towards a human partner’s hand, but only after sharing a physical joint action. Hence, in human dyads, interaction leads to a shared body representation that may influence basic attentional mechanisms. Our project investigates whether a collaborative interaction with a robot might similarly influence attention. To this aim, we designed an experiment to assess whether the mere presence of a robot with an anthropomorphic hand could bias the human partner’s attention. We replicated a classical psychological paradigm to measure this attentional bias (i.e., the near-hand effect) by adding a robotic condition. Preliminary results found the near-hand effect when performing the task with the self-hand near the screen, leading to shorter reaction times on the same side of the hand. On the contrary, we found no effect on the robot’s hand in the absence of previous collaborative interaction with the robot, in line with studies involving human partners.  

 Designing Robotic Movement with Personality   
 Vali Lalioti 
  Iulia A. Ionescu 
  As robots are starting to inhabit more intimate social spheres, their functionality and acceptance in a fundamentally social environment greatly depend on them being tolerated by humans. One factor contributing to successfully accomplishing tasks in a collaborative manner is how robots’ actions and motions are interpreted by the people around them. Our broader research seeks to explore this gap aiming to design movement that is expressive, culturally dependent and contextually sensitive. A country that is at the forefront of this, in terms of social robots and their acceptance in society, is Japan. Therefore, as the first phases of this broader research, we present a new process, including a design toolkit, an open brief and a participatory structure. We discuss the resulting robot morphologies and participant feedback from a workshop in Japan, and conclude by discussing limitations and further research in designing robots with expressive movement contextually sensitive within an HRI-for-all paradigm.

  A robot guide dog has the potential to enhance the independence and quality of life of individuals who are blind or visually impaired by providing accessible, automated, and intelligent guidance. However, developing effective robot guide dogs requires researchers not only to solve robotic perception and planning problems but also to understand complicated two-way interactions of the human-robot team. This work presents the formal definition of the wayfinding task of the robotic guide dog that is grounded by common practices in the real world. Given such a task, we train an effective policy for the robot guide dog while investigating two different human models, a rotating rod model and a rigid harness model. We show that our robot can safely guide a human user to avoid several obstacles in the real world. We also demonstrate that a proper human model is necessary to achieve collision-free navigation for both the human and the robot.  

 Uncertainty-Resolving Questions for Social Robots

  Social robots should deal with uncertainties in unseen environments and situations in an interactive setting. For humans, question-answering is one of the most typical activities for resolving or reducing uncertainty by acquiring additional information, which is also desirable for social robots. In this study, we propose a framework for leveraging the research on learning-by-asking techniques for social robots. This framework is inspired by human inquiries. Information seeking by asking should be considered at the multi-dimensional level, including required knowledge, cognitive processes, and question types. These dimensions offer a framework to embed generated questions into the three-dimensional question space, which is expected to provide a reasonable benchmark for the active learning approach and evaluation methodologies of uncertainty-resolving question generation for social robots.  

 Clarifying Social Robot Expectation Discrepancy: Developing a Framework for Understanding How Users Form Expectations of Social Robots   
 James M. Berzuk 
  James E. Young 
  When engaging with a social robot, people form expectations about the robot that may not align with its real behaviour and abilities. This gap is known as expectation discrepancy, and can confuse and disappoint users. We are developing a framework that can be used to understand and compare instances of expectation discrepancy between robots by considering the sources of those expectations. In doing so, we aim to provide a structure and unified vocabulary that can be used to support description and comparison of robot designs and the expectations users form of them. We have begun by examining theoretical work on expectations in interactions between people, and are working to synthesize this into an initial foundation. We will then refine this into a final social robot expectation framework by conducting a survey of expectation formation and discrepancy in existing social robots and projects.

  Recent work in the interaction community has revealed that drones can potentially become social entities with emotional capabilities beyond the traditional ontological status of drones as mechanical objects. We build upon this work to envision drones as an emotional support technology. To explore this notion, we ran a series of exploratory design workshops with lay users (N=18) to create designs for a companion drone. We used their inputs to analyze the drone’s concept for prototyping and future work.

  Humans tend to use various nonverbal signals to communicate their messages to their interaction partners. Previous studies utilised this channel as an essential clue to develop automatic approaches for understanding modelling and synthesizing individual behaviours in human-human interaction and human-robot interaction settings. On the other hand, in small-group interactions, an essential aspect of communication is the dynamic exchange of social signals among interlocutors. This paper introduces LISI-HHI – Learning to Imitate Social Human-Human Interaction, a dataset of dyadic human inter- actions recorded in a wide range of communication scenarios. The dataset contains multiple modalities simultaneously captured by high-accuracy sensors including motion capture, RGB-D cameras, eye trackers, and microphones. LISI-HHI is designed to be a benchmark for HRI and multimodal learning research for modelling intra- and interpersonal nonverbal signals in social interaction contexts and investigating how to transfer such models to social robots.

  Many solutions tailored for intuitive visualization or teleoperation of virtual, augmented and mixed (VAM) reality systems are not robust to robot failures, such as the inability to detect and recognize objects in the environment or planning unsafe trajectories. In this paper, we present a novel virtual reality (VR) framework where users can (i) recognize when the robot has failed to detect a real- world object, (ii) correct the error in VR, (iii) modify proposed object trajectories and, (iv) implement behaviors on a real-world robot. Finally we propose a user study aimed at testing the efficacy of our framework. Project materials can be found in the OSF repository.

  Nonverbal communication plays a crucial role in human-robot interaction (HRI) and have been widely used for robots in service environments. While few studies have addressed the understanding customer’s acceptance of robots under many different interaction conditions, the impact of robots’ nonverbal interaction modalities (i.e., a combination of body language, voice, and touch) on customers’ experience has not been investigated truly. To this end, in this paper, we introduce an HRI framework that aims to assist customers in their food and beverage choices in a real-world cafe setting. With this framework, the contribution of this paper are two folds. We introduce a time-synchronised multisensory HRI dataset comprising the interactions between a social robot and customers in a real-world environment. We conduct a user study to evaluate the configuration of multimodal HRI framework, particularly nonverbal gestures, and its contribution to customers’ interaction experience in this specific marketing setting.  

 Eye-Movement Dependency of Peripheral Visual Perception of Anthropomorphism Using an 80ms Robot Picture Stimulus   
 Kolja Kühnlenz 
  This paper investigates the impact of types of eye-movements (static vs. pursuit) on dimensions of perceived anthropomorphism of robots in the peripheral visual field (covert visual attention) in a strongly controlled video-based study design. It replicates a previous study with a contrasting refinement of using a short-term stimulus of only 80ms in order to avoid the effect of potential short direct saccades towards the stimulus. In a between-subjects design, test participants are told to follow a point target, which is either static at the screen center or moving linearly. The robot head picture is then briefly presented in the peripheral field of view region for 80ms. After stimulation, a questionnaire based on the HRIES scale on anthropomorphism is completed. Significant results show differences in anthropomorphism perception with the sociability sub-scale being affected. Other dimensions are not found to be affected, which may be subject to potential motion dependency or ambiguity of the other HRIES sub-scales. The findings may have an impact on task performance in close HRI, if a robot is only visible in the peripheral visual field and perceived covertly, while overt (foveated) visual attention of an interacting human focuses on tasks requiring hand or arm movements.  

 TSES-R: An Extended Scale for Measuring Parental Expectations toward Robots for Children in Healthcare

  Emilia Barakova 
  There is a growing interest in implementing robotics applications for children in healthcare to provide companionship, comfort, education, and therapy. Parental expectations regarding robotics for young children play a critical role in influencing its development and acceptance. However, parental expectations are widely overlooked in HRI. Therefore, a better understanding of what parents of young children expect the robot to do in health-related interactions with robots is needed. To achieve this, we adopted the Technology-Specific Expectation Scale (TSES) [2] and added three more dimensions (i.e., assistive role, social-emotional, and playful distraction) to gauge users’ expectations of robots in healthcare, resulting in TSES-R. This paper reports the development and reliability analysis of TSES-R. Furthermore, this paper presents the preliminary results collected from using the TSES-R with a sample of 31 families, which showcases how these outcomes could be helpful for future related studies.  

 A Social Robot for Explaining Medical Tests and Procedures: An Exploratory Study in the Wild

  Healthcare professionals often have little time to explain medical tests and procedures. Social robots capable of verbal dialogues may contribute to informing patients and the public in general about such tests and procedures, for example in general practitioner or hospital waiting rooms, nursery homes, as well as in public spaces. As an example of latter, an exploratory study was conducted at the Lowlands music festival in August 2022. A social robot explained a blood pressure measurement and a grip strength measurement to participants. Participants were asked to value the expected clarity of the explanation before the explanation the experienced clarity after the robot explanation but before the actual physical measurements, and after the physical measurements. 172 participants completed the interaction (99 female, 57 male, 8 non-binary, 8 undisclosed). The mean interaction duration was 2.02 minutes (SD=0.40 minutes). Participants found the explanation after the interaction with Pepper clearer than they expected beforehand. Participants found the clarity of the explanation, after they had actually undergone the physical examination, even higher than before the physical examination. This study indicates that social robots are potentially useful to explain medical tests and procedures.  

 The Warehouse Robot Interaction Sim: An Open-Source HRI Research Platform   
 Connor Esterwood 
  Lionel Peter Robert 
  The use of physical robots in real-world laboratories for the study of human-robot interaction is not without limitations and logistical challenges. In response, a wide range of studies have begun using virtual representations of robots. However, very few of these platforms are openly available to the HRI community. This limits reproducibility and the ability of the community to leverage existing resources for their own research. In response, this paper presents The Warehouse Robot Interaction Sim. The Warehouse Robot Interaction Sim is an open-source immersive virtual platform developed in the Unreal Engine with the goal of conducting research on trust repair in HRI. This paper summarizes the overall structure of the platform, how it can be modified, and briefly discuss how this platform has been leveraged for research. In doing so we hope to encourage other researchers in HRI to consider leveraging this platform for their own research questions and study designs.

  WiGlove is a passive dynamic orthosis aimed at home-based post-stroke rehabilitation of the hand and wrist. This paper highlights results from WiGlove’s formative evaluation as the first step towards its deployment. In this study, twenty healthy participants evaluated the usability and safety of the WiGlove compared to its predecessor, the state-of-the-art SCRIPT Passive Orthosis (SPO). In this within-subject experiment, they performed various tasks such as donning/doffing, adjusting the tension, grasping, etc., with both gloves and rated them using a Likert scale-based questionnaire. The results showed improvements in several aspects of usability and safety. This study provides preliminary evidence of WiGlove’s fitness for the next assessment with its intended users, people recovering from stroke with sustained hand and wrist impairment.

  This ROB-I-LEARN research utilizes a versatile framework (e.g., Business Model Canvas or BMC) for robot design and curriculum development aimed at students diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Robotic interventions / human-robot interaction (HRI) field experiments with high school students were conducted as a recommendation or an outcome of the BMC framework and customer discovery interviews. These curriculum-related robotic interventions / interactive scenarios were designed to improve cognitive rehabilitation targeting students with ASD in high schools, thus enabling a higher quality learning environment that corresponds with students’ learning requirements to prepare them for future learning and workforce environments.  

 Enhancing Human-robot Collaboration by Exploring Intuitive Augmented Reality Design Representations   
 Chrisantus Eze 
  Christopher Crick 
  As the use of Augmented Reality (AR) to enhance interactions between human agents and robotic systems in a work environment continues to grow, robots must communicate their intents in informative yet straightforward ways. This improves the human agent’s feeling of trust and safety in the work environment while also reducing task completion time. To this end, we discuss a set of guidelines for the systematic design of AR interfaces for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) systems. Furthermore, we develop design frameworks that would ride on these guidelines and serve as a base for researchers seeking to explore this direction further. We develop a series of designs for visually representing the robot’s planned path and reactions, which we evaluate by conducting a user survey involving 14 participants. Subjects were given different design representations to review and rate based on their intuitiveness and informativeness. The collated results showed that our design representations significantly improved the participants’ ease of understanding the robot’s intents over the baselines for the robot’s proposed navigation path, planned arm trajectory, and reactions.

  Robotic Telepresence (RT) is a promising medium for students who are unable to attend in-person classes. It enables remote students to be present in the classroom and interact with their classmates and instructors. However, it can be limiting to their identity self-perception and projection, which may have repercussions on the social dynamics and inclusion within the classroom. We present preliminary findings of a qualitative analysis of 12 observations and interviews with RT attendees. We examine RT design and use aspects that either supported identity self-perception and projection or limited it. Finally, we present telepresence robots design and use recommendations for the classroom context.  

 Will It Yield: Expectations on Automated Shuttle Bus Interactions With Pedestrians and Bicyclists

  Tom Ziemke 
  Autonomous vehicles that operate on public roads need to be predictable to others, including vulnerable road users. In this study, we asked participants to take the perspective of videotaped pedestrians and cyclists crossing paths with an automated shuttle bus, and to (1) judge whether the bus would stop safely in front of them and (2) report whether the bus’s actual stopping behavior accorded with their expectations. The results show that participants expected the bus to brake safely in approximately two thirds of the human-vehicle interactions, more so to pedestrians than cyclists, and that they tended to underestimate rather than overestimate the bus’s capability to yield in ways that they considered as safe. These findings have implications for the design and implementation of automated shuttle bus services.

We used followbots, robots that haul equipment without social interaction, to investigate perceptions of leader configuration on credibility, attraction, and social presence across three scenarios (leader leader/followbot, leader/human). The followbot rated higher than the leader-only condition for competence leadership effectiveness, and social presence. As socially silent machines gain popularity, this research has implications for understanding how robots function as social cues.

  Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to handle traffic scenarios more safely and efficiently than human drivers. However, it needs to be better understood which AV decisions are perceived to be unsafe or risky by drivers. To investigate drivers’ perceived risk, we conducted a driving simulator experiment where participants are driven around by two types of AVs—car and sidewalk mobility—with a driving style that matches the participant’s driving style. We developed a computational model that allows us to examine drivers’ perceived risk of scenarios when interacting with an AV based on the drivers’ interventions. The model allows us to quantify and compare the relative perceived risk of different scenarios for the two mobility types. Our results indicate that 1) drivers perceived higher risk in scenarios where the AV attempts to match the driver’s preferred driving style, and 2) different scenarios were perceived as having higher risk across the two mobility types. The ability to quantify the perceived risk of scenarios and an understanding of how perceived risk differs across mobility types will provide critical insights for the design of human-aware mobility.  

 The Answer lies in User Experience: Qualitative Comparison of US and South Korean Perceptions of In-home Robotic Pet Interactions   
 Ji-Yeong Oh 
  Casey C. Bennett 
  This paper describes a user experience comparison study to explore whether a user’s ‘cultural background’ affects their interaction with in-home pet robots designed for health purposes, e.g. socially-assistive robots (SARs). 11 Koreans and 10 Americans were interviewed after interacting in their own homes with a SAR. Statistical analyses and TF-IDF keyword analyses were conducted to detect significant differences between groups in terms of code co-occurrences. Results showed that American participants were more likely to focus on the interactive experience itself, whereas Korean participants focused more on critiquing technical aspects of the technology. Such differences suggest that Koreans tend to treat robotic pets as “tools”, while Americans view the robotic pet through the lens of their past experience raising real-life pets. We discuss implications of this for human-robot interaction (HRI) regarding SARs may be dependent on users’ cultural characteristics e.g. necessitating customized content that takes into account culturally-specific modes of use.  

 Development of a Wearable Robot that Moves on the User’s Arm to Provide Calming Interactions   
 Koji Kimura 
  Fumihide Tanaka 
  Wearable robots can maintain constant physical contact with the user and support its daily life. However since most wearable robots are fixed on the user’s body, the user has to be constantly aware of their presence. Sometimes this can impose a burden on the user and prevents them from wearing the robot daily. One solution to this problem is for the robot to move around the user’s body. When the user does not interact with the robot, it can move to an unobtrusive position and attract less attention from the user. This research aims to actualize such a wearable robot. In addition, by introducing flexible rubber joints, we aim for creating calming interactions with the user wearing the robot. This short paper reports the development of our initial prototypes.  

 Designing a Robot which Touches the User’s Head with Intra-Hug Gestures

  Hidenobu Sumioka 
  Masahiro Shiomi 
  There are a lot of positive benefits of hugging, and several studies have applied its application in human-robot interaction. However, due to the limitation of a robot performance, these robots only touched the human’s back. In this study, we developed a hug robot, named “Moffuly-II.” This robot can hug not only with intra-hug gestures, but also touch the user’s back or head. This paper describes the robot system and the user’s impression of hug with the robot.

  Teleconferencing technology has been widely used in the context of the covid-19 pandemic. However, local and remote participants always have a poorer experience of hybrid discussion for various reasons in the leaderless group discussions with mixed online and offline members. In this paper, this phenomenon is explored through an early pilot study. We found problems with the lack of presence of remote participants in hybrid discussion sessions, as well as unclear information about the status of members. To solve such problems, we’ve designed a social robot called SNOTBOX. The bot indicates the participation status (marginalized or not) of the remote participant using “Buzzo” and the remote participant’s desire to be heard through a “Eureka”. We used both representations to attract the attention of local participants as a way to enhance the presence of remote participants in the conference. SNOTBOX is easy to produce and allows for DIY customization, and also supports multi-participant online discussions.

  Hasti Seifi 
  Recent robot collections provide various interactive tools for users to explore and analyze their datasets. Yet, the literature lacks data on how users interact with these collections and which tools can best support their goals. This late-breaking report presents preliminary data on the utility of four interactive tools for accessing a collection of robot hands. The tools include a gallery and similarity comparison for browsing and filtering existing hands, a prediction tool for estimating user impression of hands (e.g., humanlikeness), and a recommendation tool suggesting design features (e.g., number of fingers) for achieving a target user impression rating. Data from a user study with 9 novice robotics researchers suggest the users found the tools useful for various tasks and especially appreciated the gallery and recommendation functionalities for understanding the complex relationships of the data. We discuss the results and outline future steps for developing interface design guidelines for robot collections.  

 Anomaly Detection for Dynamic Human-Robot Assembly: Application of an LSTM-based Autoencoder to interpret uncertain human behavior in HRC   
 Fabian Schirmer 
  Philipp Kranz 
  Jan Schmitt 
  Tobias Kaupp 
  Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) requires humans and robots to work on the same product in the same work environment at the same time. Therefore, the robotic system needs to understand human behavior so it can assist the human appropriately. Since the human is an uncertain variable in this system, human action recognition is one of the key challenges when it comes to HRC. To address this problem, we developed an anomaly detection framework for the dynamic assembly of complex products. We used an Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM)-based autoencoder to detect anomalies in human behavior and post-process the output to categorize it as a green or red anomaly. A green anomaly represents a deviation from the intended order but a valid assembly sequence. A red anomaly represents an invalid sequence. In both cases, the worker is guided to complete the assembly process. We demonstrate our proposed framework using an appropriate industrial use case.  

 How Sequential Suggestions from a Robot and Human Jury Influence Decision Making: A Large Scale Investigation using a Court Sentencing Judgment Task   
 Yugo Hayashi 
  Kosuke Wakabayashi 
  Yuki Nishida 
  There have been discussions on using robots to provide suggestions for decision making in mixed jury-systems. Hence, it is vital to investigate the influence of system interventions on decision making. This study focused on how such suggestions from a robot and an expert human influenced the decision making of a sentence in a court judgment task. We hypothesized that the sequential pattern of presentation of suggestions by an AI system installed in a robot and a human expert would influence decision making performance. In a large-scale online experiment, we investigated several factors, such as the (a) adviser type (AI(Robot) or Human), (b) sequential order (AI to Human, Human to AI), and (c) length of the sentence (3 or 7 years) that would influence decision making. The results showed that when presented with a human expert’s suggestion, after an AI decision, participants were more biased towards the human’s suggestion. Moreover, participants’ decisions were influenced by the length of the suggestion, especially when presented with heavy lengths (seven years). This provides new implications on the factors that may influence decision making using robots as tools in a mixed jury-system and contributes to the notion of using robots in courts.  

 PLATYPUS: An Environment for End-User Development of Robot-Assisted Physical Training   
 Jose Pablo De la Rosa Gutierrez 
  Anders Stengaard Sørensen 
  When robots are used for physical therapy, programming becomes too important to be left to programmers. Developing programs for training robots is time-consuming and requires expertise within multiple engineering domains, combined with physical training, therapy, and human interaction competencies. In this paper, we present Platypus: an end-user development environment that encompasses the design and execution of custom activities for robot-assisted physical training. The current version ships a set of plugins for Eclipse’s IDE and uses a block-based visual language to specify the robot’s behaviors at a high abstraction level, which are translated into the low-level code specifications followed by the robot. As a use case, we present its implementation on RoboTrainer, a modular, rope-based pulling device for training at home. While user tests suggest that the platform has the potential to reduce the technical obstacles for building custom training scenarios, informational and design learning barriers were revealed during the tests.  

 Towards HRI of Everyday Life: Human Lived Experiences with Social Robots   
 Karolina Zawieska 
  Jessica Sorenson 
  As the HRI field evolves, the way we understand, and study human-robot interaction also inevitably changes. We argue here that there has been a gradual shift in HRI research from investigating a concept of human-robot ‘interaction’ towards that of ‘experience’. This includes User Experience (UX) approaches in the first place but also those perspectives that begin to go beyond mere usability and optimization toward meaningful social interactions and social experiences. This paper addresses the shift in question from a sociological perspective and proposes to bring it even further to include a systematic study of human ‘lived experiences’ taking place in the community contexts. The ultimate goal is to facilitate theoretical and methodological developments needed to systematically address and pursue research on the ‘HRI of Everyday Life’.  

 The Peg-Turning Dilemma: An Experimental Framework for Measuring Altruistic Behaviour Towards Robots

  This paper presents the results of a preregistered pilot study testing an experimental framework to measure altruistic behaviour towards robots. We define altruistic behaviour as behaviour that benefits others at a personal cost to the behaving individual. The pilot study explores feelings of guilt and perceived agency and experience (i.e., mind) in the robot as potential predictors of altruistic behaviour. Using a within-subjects design (n=48), we compared the willingness to perform a dull, repetitive task (i.e., turning pegs in a pegboard) to avoid shaking (harming) either an emotion-simulating robot, or a non-responsive object. The results showed that participants felt significantly more guilty after shaking the robot than after shaking the object, and they perceived more agency and experience in the robot than in the object. Finally, even though participants felt significantly more bored after performing the peg-turning task than after subsequent tasks they were significantly more willing to repeat this task to avoid shaking the robot again, compared to the object. An exploratory regression analysis showed that feelings of guilt were the only significant predictor of this behaviour.  

 Social Robots in Secondary Education: Can Robots Assist Young Adult Learners with Math Learning?   
 Aurea Bravo Perucho 
  Maryam Alimardani 
  Social robots have been extensively studied in educational settings for children and their positive impacts on children’s learning are reported. The aim of this study was to find out whether embodied educational technologies such as robot tutors can also yield similar results with adult learners. An experiment was conducted in a secondary education mathematics classroom, where 15 students (of ages 17 to 20) worked on math exercises in two conditions. In one condition, a Nao robot was present as a math tutor to read the questions collect answers and provide feedback. In the other condition, students practiced math exercises on a laptop which is a non-social and non-embodied technology. Results indicated that students in secondary education do not seem to favor using a robot tutor over traditional technologies. This implies that there is a difference between children and adults in the way they experience this technology in its current state-of-the-art for their education.  

 Augmented Reality Safety Zone Configurations in Human-Robot Collaboration: A User Study   
 Yunus Emre Cogurcu 
  Steve Maddock 
  Close interaction with robots in Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) can increase worker productivity in production, but cages around the robot often limit this. Our research aims to visualise virtual safety zones around a real robot arm with Augmented Reality (AR), thereby replacing the cages. We tested our system with a collaborative pick-and-place application which mimics a real manufacturing scenario in an industrial robot cell. The shape, size and visualisation of the AR safety zones were tested with 19 participants. The overwhelming preference was for a visualisation that used cylindrical AR safety zones together with a virtual cage bars effect.  

 I See You! Design Factors for Supporting Pedestrian-AV Interaction at Crosswalks   
 Avram Block

  Paul Schmitt 
  With the advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on public roads, the frequency of interactions between these AVs and pedestrians will increase. One example of such an interaction is at unsignalized crosswalks, where pedestrians and vehicles must negotiate for the right of way. Studies show that these interactions often use social communication channels. This paper addresses how AVs can fill this communication gap, focusing on the impact of pedestrian self-identifiability. Using VR, we designed two novel awareness-conveying behaviors, and a control condition with no awareness behavior. We then conducted a within-subjects VR study with 19 participants in which they traversed a crosswalk in front of a driverless vehicle in each experimental condition and rated their experience across seven probes. Results indicated that an awareness-conveying behavior significantly increased pedestrians’ sense of safety and that increases in self-identifiability further improved pedestrians’ experience without resulting in a heightened sense of surveillance from the vehicle.

  Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in children, but adherence to asthma medications is very low, which can lead to poor or even dangerous outcomes. To solve this problem, we came up with a baby whale pet robot that needs to be taken care of by children. In this paper, we present the design of our first prototype to explore whether a pet robot could help improve medication adherence in children with asthma.

  Hand disinfection is an important tool in the line of defense against infectious diseases. Hand sanitizer dispensers are usually passive devices sitting at entrances of buildings and other frequented locations. In this study we explore the usefulness of an interactive mobile hand sanitizer robot, more specifically, the research is focused on finding the most significant attention-grabbing modality for the robot to motivate people to disinfect their hands. Through an in -the-wild Wizard-of-Oz experiment and a short questionnaire each of the four usage modalities was tested in the entrance hall of a university. The results show that movement had the most significant impact, compared to sound and nothing at all, yet due to the robot’s design the participants expected it to talk to them.

  Adaptive robots have the potential to support the overloaded healthcare system by helping new stroke survivors learn about their conditions. However, current adaptive robots often fail to maintain users’ engagement during interactions. This study investigated the impact of an adaptive robot on Social Agency which has been proposed to influence engagement during learning. Twenty-four healthy subjects participated in a study where they learned about stroke symptoms from a robot providing social cues either 1) when their engagement measured by a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) decreased or 2) at random intervals. While the results confirmed that Social Agency correlated with Engagement, the robot’s adaptive behaviour did not increase Social Agency, Engagement, and Information Recall. Using qualitative methods, we propose that adaptive robots need to explicitly acknowledge users to increase Social Agency.

  Meaningful first-time interactions between humans and robots are important for learning functionality shaping impressions, and building trust. Additionally, robots should be an inclusive tool, accessible to all yet typical introductory human-robot interactions rely heavily on the human’s visual perceptions. For children and young people with sight loss, this is can be problematic. Therefore, we present a preliminary workshop with four children and young people with sight loss in order to begin investigating how this population learns about social robots for the first time, their overall impressions of social robots, and whether games could assist in creating positive first-time interactions. Our initial findings reveal the importance of promoting tactile exploration, clarifying safety aspects, and careful consideration of the communication of robot emotion.

  Demonstration is an effective end-user development paradigm for teaching robots how to perform new tasks. In this paper, we posit that demonstration is useful not only as a teaching tool, but also as a way to understand and assist end-user developers in thinking about a task at hand. As a first step toward gaining this understanding, we constructed a lightweight web interface to crowdsource step-by-step instructions of common household tasks, leveraging the imaginations and past experiences of potential end-user developers. As evidence of the utility of our interface, we deployed the interface on Amazon Mechanical Turk and collected 207 task traces that span 18 different task categories. We describe our vision for how these task traces can be operationalized as task models within end-user development tools and provide a roadmap for future work.

  Lane changes of autonomous vehicles (AV) should not only succeed in making the maneuver but also provide a positive interaction experience for other drivers. As lane changes involve complex interactions identification of a set of behaviors for autonomous vehicle lane change communication can be difficult to define. This study investigates different movements communicating AV lane change intent in order to identify which effectively communicates and positively affects other drivers’ decisions. We utilized a virtual reality environment wherein 14 participants were each placed in the driver’s seat of a car and experienced four different AV lane change signals. Our findings suggest that expressive lane change behaviors such as lateral movement have high levels of legibility at the cost of high perceived aggressiveness. We propose further investigation into how balancing key parameters of lateral movement can balance in legibility and aggressiveness that provide the best AV interaction experience for human drivers

  As autonomous vehicles (AV) become increasingly common on our roads, it is important for first responders – police officers, firefighters, and emergency medical services to learn new interaction protocols as they can no longer rely on those applied to human-driven vehicles. This study identifies critical pain points and concerns of first responders interacting with AVs on the road. We explore 7 different designs that communicate that an AV is in park and is safe to approach and analyze how first responders perceive these designs in terms of clarity and safety. We conducted qualitative interviews with 9 first responders and gained insights on how the needs of first responders can be integrated within the AV design process. As a result, we identify an AV safe park state communication protocol that would be ideal for first responders. Additionally, we derive a guideline for effective communication methods that can be used in the design of these vehicles establishing research methods that involve emergency responders within the loop.  

 Multisensory Evaluation of Human-Robot Interaction in Retail Stores – The Effect of Mobile Cobots on Individuals’ Physical and Neurophysiological Responses   
 Yue Luo 
  Yuhao Chen 
  Boyi Hu 
  As more mobile collaborative robots (cobots) are being deployed in domestic environments, it is necessary to ensure safety while interacting with humans. To this end, a better understanding of individuals’ physical and neurophysiological responses (i.e., short term adaptation) during those interactions becomes crucial to frame the cobot’s behavioral and control algorithms. The primary objective of this study was to assess individuals’ physical and neurophysiological responses to the mobile cobot in a retail environment. Eight participants were recruited to complete typical grocery shopping tasks (i.e., cart pushing, item picking, and item sorting) with and without a mobile robot running in the same space. Results showed the co-existence of mobile cobot in the retail environment stimulated individuals’ physical responses, by significantly changing their upper-limb kinematics, i.e., reducing the average flexion angles of L5/S1, T12/L1, and right shoulder in the sagittal plane. However, no significant differences were observed in the neurophysiological adaptation based on the measures of muscle activity of the latissimus dorsi, anterior deltoid, and bicep brachii, nor the pupil diameter.  

 Cat-E: A Social Robot Guiding Children’s Activities with AI Art Generator   
 Pooja Malvi 
  Hee Rin Lee 
  The increasing number of public AI-art generation tools has allowed people, including children, to be creative and bring their ideas to life. However, these AI systems could be misused by children and expose them to age-inappropriate images. In this paper, we explore how social robots could guide children as an embodied element of the AI art generation system. To investigate this topic, we examined how children conceptualize AI observed how they use an AI-art generation system called DALL-E 2, and conducted co-design workshops to develop a social robot prototype, Cat-E. The Cat-E aims to help children generate AI art in a regulated, safe but creative way by providing prompts and leading them to generate more ethical and morally sound AI art. This study reveals that children perceive a robot as an embodied element of AI and consider it to be a reliable and unbiased source of information. We propose that social robots can play a role of a friendly guide that enables children creatively but safely utilize AI systems.  

 Improving a Robot’s Turn-Taking Behavior in Dynamic Multiparty Interactions

  In this paper, we describe ongoing work to develop a robust and natural turn-taking behavior for a social agent to engage a dynamically changing group in a conversation. We specifically focus on discussing likely interaction scenarios for a social robot and how appropriate conversational behavior could unfold in each situation. Preliminary findings from annotations of more than 9,000 dialogue samples from a related domain are used to help judge the importance of different interaction scenarios. We conclude by outlining important general considerations for designing more robust dialogue systems as well as highlight next steps we are taking in developing our character’s turn-taking behavior.  

 Attention-guiding Takeover Requests for Situation Awareness in Semi-autonomous Driving   
 Qingxin Chen 
  Jialong Li 
  Kenji Tei 
  In semi-autonomous driving (SAE Level-3), the automated driving system allows drivers to focus on their non-driving-related tasks for the majority of the journey. However, when the system faces situations beyond its operational design domain, the drivers need to manually control the vehicle responding to the takeover request (TOR). Many efforts have been made in previous studies to find a more effective method to initiate the TOR. In this paper, we propose to improve drivers’ takeover performance by utilizing attention-guiding techniques when delivering the TOR. A preliminary experiment (N=19) indicates that our method reduced drivers’ collision rate and mental workload.  

 What Does It Mean to Anthropomorphize Robots?: Food For Thought for HRI Research   
 Samia Cornelius Bhatti 
  Lionel Peter Robert 
  Anthropomorphism is a well-used but vague concept that demands further understanding and clarification to be effectively used in HRI research. Although most HRI research defines and uses anthropomorphism as a human-like attribution process, there is lack of distinction between its deployment in design versus its manifestation in user response. Furthermore, researchers need to separate mindless from mindful anthropomorphism and find ways to theorize and measure each. Researchers also need to consider the dynamic and contextual nature of anthropomorphism to generate relevant findings for research as well as practice.  

 Presenting Human-Robot Relative Hand Position using a Multi-Step Vibrotactile Stimulus for Handover Task   
 Muhammad Akmal Bin Mohammed Zaffir 
  Takahiro Wada 
  For humans to hand over an object to a robot, confirming the robot hand’s position through their sensory organs (i.e., vision) is required. Only then can perform the hand-reaching task. This step is time-consuming and visual demand can also degrade other simultaneously conducted tasks performances. We assume that eliminating this step can lead to a rapid and precise reaching task. We propose a method to directly present the relative position of human-robot hands using phantom sensation-based vibrotactile stimulus on the human reaching arm. A multi-step vibrotactile cue; 1) gross motion, 2) fine motion, and 3) deadband, is provided to indicate the direction, distance to the target, and a signal indicating the reached target, respectively. The experimental result shows that users could precisely recognize the target position in a given shorter time. This indicates that humans can use the proposed method to initiate their ballistic movement for hand-reaching during the handover task.  

 Exploring the Effects of Self-Disclosed Backstory of Social Robots on Development of Trust in Human-Robot Interaction   
 Naeimeh Anzabi 
  Anahita Etemad 
  Hiroyuki Umemuro 
  This paper investigated the influence of a social robot which discloses a backstory of its experiences on the development of trust in human-robot interaction with respect to the nature of backstories. We compared three cases of backstories, a happy backstory, a sorrowful backstory and no backstory told by the robot during interaction with participants. The results indicated that the robot disclosing a happy backstory provided the participants with higher impression of trustworthiness in general and affective trust compared to the robot telling no backstory. However, the robot with sorrowful backstory was not evaluated to lead to higher trustworthiness than the robot with no backstory. Furthermore, the happy backstory condition scored higher than the sorrowful backstory condition in general, affective and cognitive trust. Thus, participants rated a happy backstory tied to positive self-disclosed emotion, to be significantly more influential in human-robot trust.  

 ‘Sorry’ Says the Robot: The Tendency to Anthropomorphize and Technology Affinity Affect Trust in Repair Strategies after Error   
 Johannes Maria Kraus 
  Julia Merger 
  Felix Gröner 
  Jessica Pätz 
  This research investigates how six different trust repair strategies (apologies, explanations and denial) of a robot packing lunch bags affect trust after an error and how user dispositions predict trust in the repair strategies. In an online experiment, the perceived trustworthiness was assessed in a within-subjects design (N = 604) in which all strategies were evaluated in direct comparison. Higher trustworthiness of an apology (vs. no apology) and of a technical explanation for an error (vs. an empty and an anthropomorphic explanation) was found. In line with theoretical considerations, user personality was found to be associated with trust in specific strategies. A higher tendency to anthropomorphize technology was associated with higher trust in an anthropomorphic explanation and technological affinity was associated with a higher trust in the technical explanation. Taken together, personalization of trust repair strategies is a promising direction for individualized design to foster trustworthy human-robot interaction.  

 Effects of Predictive Robot Eyes on Trust and Task Performance in an Industrial Cooperation Task   
 Linda Onnasch 
  Paul Schweidler 
  Maximilian Wieser 
  Industrial cobots can perform variable action sequences. For human-robot interaction (HRI) this can have detrimental effects, as the robot’s actions can be difficult to predict. In human interaction, eye gaze intuitively directs attention and communicates subsequent actions. Whether this mechanism can benefit HRI too, is not well understood. This study investigated the impact of anthropomorphic eyes as directional cues in robot design. 42 participants worked on two subsequent tasks in an embodied HRI with a Sawyer robot. The study used a between-subject design and presented either anthropomorphic eyes, arrows or a black screen as control condition on the robot’s display. Results showed that neither directional stimuli nor the anthropomorphic design in particular led to increased trust. But anthropomorphic robot eyes improved the prediction speed whereas this effect could not be found for non-anthropomorphic cues (arrows). Anthropomorphic eyes therefore seem to be better suitable for an implementation on an industrial robot.

  Robotic rehabilitation devices are showing strong potential for intensive, task-oriented, and personalized motor training. Integrating Mixed Reality (MR) technology and tangible objects in these systems allow the creation of attractive, stimulating, and personalized hybrid environments. Using a gamification approach MR-based robotic training can increase patients’ motivation, engagement, and experience. This paper presents the development of two Mixed Reality-based exergames to perform bimanual exercises assisted by a shoulder rehabilitation exoskeleton and using tangible objects. The system design was completed by adopting a user-centered iterative process. The system evaluates task performance and cost function metrics from the kinematic analysis of the hands’ movement. A preliminary evaluation of the system is presented, which shows the correct operation of the system and the fact that it stimulates the desired upper limb movements.  

 Bridging the Gap: Using a Game-based Approach to Raise Lay People’s Awareness About Care Robots   
 Katharina Brunnmayr 
  Astrid Weiss 
  As people’s expectations regarding robots are still mostly shaped by the media and Science Fiction, there exists a gap between imaginaries of robots and the state-of-the-art of robotic technologies. Care robots are one example of existing robots that the general public has little awareness about. In this report, we introduce a card-based game prototype developed with the goal to bridge this gap and explore how people conceive of existing care robots as a part of their daily lives. Based on the trial game runs, we conclude that game-based approach is effective as a device to inform participants in a playful setting about existing care robots and to elicit conversations about the role such robots could play in their lives. In the future we plan to adapt the prototype and create a design game prototype to develop novel use cases for care robots.  

 Body Gesture Recognition to Control a Social Mobile Robot   
 Javier Laplaza

  In this work, we propose a gesture-based language to allow humans to interact with robots using their body in a natural way. We have created a new gesture detection model using neural networks and a new dataset of humans making a collection of body gestures to train this architecture. Furthermore, we compare body gesture communication with other communication channels to demonstrate the importance of adding this knowledge to robots. The presented approach is validated in diverse simulations and real-life experiments with non-trained volunteers. This attains promising results and establishes that it is a valuable framework for social robotic applications, such as human robot collaboration or human-robot interaction.

  We are developing a social robot to help children cope with painful and distressing medical procedures in the hospital emergency department. This is a domain where a range of interventions have proven effective at reducing pain and distress, including social robots; however, until now, the robots have been designed with limited stakeholder involvement and have shown limited autonomy. For our system, we have defined and validated the necessary robot behaviour together with children, parents/caregivers, and healthcare professionals, taking into account the ethical and social implications of robotics and AI in the paediatric healthcare context. The result of the co-design process has been captured in a flowchart, which has been converted into a set of concrete design guidelines for the AI-based autonomous robot system.

  Searching via speech with a robot can be used to better support children in expressing their information needs. We report on an exploratory study where children (N=35) worked on search tasks with two robots using different interaction styles. One system posed closed, yes/no questions and was more system-driven while the other system used open-ended questions and was more user-driven. We studied children’s preferences and experiences of these interaction styles using questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. We found no overall strong preference between the interaction styles. However, some children reported task-dependent preferences. We further report on children’s interpretation and reasoning around interaction styles for robots supporting information search.  

 Utilizing Prior Knowledge to Improve Automatic Speech Recognition in Human-Robot Interactive Scenarios   
 Pradip Pramanick 
  Chayan Sarkar 
  The prolificacy of human-robot interaction not only depends on a robot’s ability to understand the intent and content of the human utterance but also gets impacted by the automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. Modern ASR can provide highly accurate (grammatically and syntactically) translation. Yet, the general purpose ASR often misses out on the semantics of the translation by incorrect word prediction due to open-vocabulary modeling. ASR inaccuracy can have significant repercussions as this can lead to a completely different action by the robot in the real world. Can any prior knowledge be helpful in such a scenario? In this work, we explore how prior knowledge can be utilized in ASR decoding. Using our experiments, we demonstrate how our system can significantly improve ASR translation for robotic task instruction.  

 Let’s Roll Together: Children Helping a Robot Play a Dice Game   
 Emily Timmerman 
  Mike E.U. Ligthart 
  Play is an important part of children’s lives and playing with social robots could provide powerful interventions, for example in education. However, child-robot play is often restricted by the technical limitations of the robot. Tools like Bluetooth-connected dice could circumvent some of these limitations, but technical limitations can also be resolved in a social way. In this paper, we explore children playing a dice game with a Nao robot. The Nao robot cannot pick up the dice. We compared two modes of helping: rolling for the robot and handing the dice to the robot. The results show that children prefer handing the dice to the robot. They feel the robot is more involved when it physically participates. Children who feel the robot is more involved, enjoy the game more. Finally, we found evidence that helping the robot might even be preferred over the robot not needing any help.

  Although robot-to-human touch experiments have been performed, they have all used direct tele-operation with a remote controller, pre-programmed hand motions, or tracked the human with wearable trackers. This report introduces a project that aims to visually track and touch a person’s face with a humanoid android using a single RGB-D camera for 3D pose estimation. There are three major components: 3D pose estimation, a touch sensor for the android’s hand, and a controller that combines the pose and sensor information to direct the android’s actions. The pose estimation is working and released under as open-source. A touch sensor glove has been built and we have begun work on creating an under-skin version. Finally, we have tested android face-touch control. These tests showed many hurdles that will need to be overcome, but also how convincing the experience already is for the potential of this technology to elicit strong emotional responses.

  Peripartum Depression (PPD) affects 8-15 percent of new mothers in Sweden every year; a majority of PPD cases go undetected, and only a small percentage receives adequate care. Social Assistive Robots (SARs) bring great potential for healthcare applications. Using SARs in healthcare tasks, for example PPD Screening, could reduce healthcare professionals’ strain, by supporting them, without replacing them, in key roles. However, studies that investigate the possibility to utilize SARs in PPD screening are scarce. In this paper, we present an interview study with ten mothers with prior experience of PPD in relation to their pregnancy. The contributions from this work are twofold. First, we elicited participants’ opinions and attitudes towards utilizing SARs in PPD screening. Second, we explored participants’ expressed needs in PPD screening. From the participants’ statements, we discovered potential scenarios which could address future patients’ needs. These insights could be used as a foundation for the development of SARs in PPD screening and other mental healthcare applications, thus helping address PPD in women.  

 Chaos to Control: Human Assisted Scene Inspection

  Elin Anna Topp 
  We are working towards a mixed reality-based human-robot collaboration interface using gaze and gesture as methods of communicating intent in a search and rescue scenario to optimize the operation. The lack of mature algorithms and control schemes for autonomous systems makes it still difficult for them to operate safely in high-risk environments. We are approaching the problem through symbiosis while utilizing humans’ intuition of the environment and robots’ capability to travel through unknown environments for optimal performance in a given time.  

 The Effect of Gender on Perceived Anthropomorphism and Intentional Acceptance of a Storytelling Robot   
 Daan Robben

  Mirjam De Haas 
  Gender and anthropomorphism play a substantial role in how social robots are perceived. In child-robot interaction, children’s perception of the robot can be influenced by individual factors, such as the robot’s gender. The purpose of this study is to examine how gender congruity affects the way children perceive social storytelling robots. Furthermore, the relationships among gender congruity, anthropomorphism, and intentional acceptance were investigated. Sixty-four children interacted with a storytelling robot. The results indicated that children did not humanize the robot to a higher degree if the robot’s gender matched with the children’s gender. Moreover, children who anthropomorphised the robot to a higher degree found the robot more sociable and had higher intentions of using the robot repeatedly. The findings of this studies contrast with previous scientific work, and indicate more research should be conducted to find out which factors play a vital role in the humanization and gendering of robots.  

 Hey Robot, Can You Help Me Feel Less Lonely?: An Explorative Study to Examine the Potential of Using Social Robots to Alleviate Loneliness in Young Adults   
 Aike C. Horstmann 
  An often-forgotten group of people which is heavily affected by loneliness are young adults. The perceived social isolation often stems from attachment insecurities and social skill deficiencies. Since robots can function as social interaction partners who exert less social pressure and display less social complexity they may pose a promising approach to alleviate this problematic situation. The goal would not be to replace human interaction partners, but to diminish acute loneliness and accompanying detrimental effects and to function as social skills coach and practice interaction partner. To explore the potential of this approach, a preregistered quantitative online study (N = 150) incorporating a video-based interaction with a social robot and qualitative elements was conducted. First results show that young adults report less state loneliness after interacting with the robot than before. Technically affine people evaluate the robot’s sociability as well as the interaction with it more positively, people with a general negative attitude towards robots less positively. Furthermore, the more trait loneliness people report to experience, the less sociable they perceive the robot.  

 Towards Online Adaptation for Autonomous Household Assistants

  Many assistive home robotics applications assume open-loop interactions: robots incorporate little feedback from people while autonomously completing tasks. This places undue burden on people to condition their actions and environment to maximize the likelihood of their desired outcomes. We formalize assistive household rearrangement as collaborative online inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Since online IRL can lead to sample inefficient interactions and overfit to specific user objectives, we compare sample efficiency and generalizability of two initial choices of action representations in a simulated household rearrangement task. We show, under certain assumptions, that representing objects by their material properties can increase sample efficiency and generalizability to out of domain objects.

  The use of socially assistive robots is able to alleviate some depression symptoms, according to existing research. However, due to comorbidities that often accompany depression and the unique experiences of each individual, it is necessary to get a better understanding of how SARs should be personalized. Through 10 hourlong workshops with 10 individuals living with depression, we explored the customization of a zoomorphic SAR for adults with depression. By using the SAR Therabot? as a base platform, participants designed their own unique covering for the robot, and discussed desired robot behaviors and privacy concerns around data collection. Though the physical designs of the robots varied greatly, participants expressed common themes regarding their preference for a soft touchable exterior, comfort with sharing data with their therapists, and interest in the robot producing more realistic sounds and movements, among other design features.  

 Development of a University Guidance and Information Robot   
 Andrew Blair 
  Mary Ellen Foster 
  We are developing a social robot that will be deployed in a large, recently-built university building designed for learning and teaching. We outline the design process for this robot, which has included consultations with stakeholders including members of university services, students and other visitors to the building, as well as members of the “Reach Out” team who normally provide in-person support in the building. These consultations have resulted in a clear specification of the desired robot functionality, which will combine central helpdesk queries with local information about the building and the surrounding university campus. We outline the technical components that will be used to develop the robot system, and also describe how the success of the deployed robot will be evaluated.  

 Towards a Computational Approach for Proactive Robot Behaviour in Assistive Tasks

  While most of the current work has been focused on developing adaptive techniques to respond to human-initiated inputs (what behaviour to perform), very few of them have explored how to proactively initiate an interaction (when to perform a given behaviour). The selection of the proper action, its timing and confidence are essential features for the success of proactive behaviour, especially in collaborative and assistive contexts. In this work, we present the initial phase towards the deployment of a robotic system that will be capable of learning what, when, and with what confidence to provide assistance to users playing a sequential memory game.  

 L2 Vocabulary Learning Through Lexical Inferencing Stories With a Social Robot   
 Hoi Ki Tang

  Rianne van den Berghe 
  Vocabulary is a crucial part of second language (L2) learning. Children learn new vocabulary by forming mental lexicon relations with their existing knowledge. This is called lexical inferencing: using the available clues and knowledge to guess the meaning of the unknown word. This study explored the potential of second language vocabulary acquisition through lexical inferencing in child-robot interaction. A storytelling robot read a book to Dutch kindergartners (N = 36, aged 4-6 years) in Dutch in which a few key words were translated into French (L2), and with a robot providing additional word explanation cues or not. The results showed that the children learned the key words successfully as a result of the reading session with the storytelling robot, but that there was no significant effect of additional word explanation cues by the robot. Overall, it seems promising that lexical inferencing can act as a new and different way to teach kindergartners a second language.  

 Visuo-Textual Explanations of a Robot’s Navigational Choices   
 Amar Halilovic 
  Felix Lindner 
  With the rise in the number of robots in our daily lives, human-robot encounters will become more frequent. To improve human-robot interaction (HRI), people will require explanations of robots’ actions, especially if they do something unexpected. Our focus is on robot navigation, where we explain why robots make specific navigational choices. Building on methods from the area of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), we employ a semantic map and techniques from the area of Qualitative Spatial Reasoning (QSR) to enrich visual explanations with knowledge-level spatial information. We outline how a robot can generate visual and textual explanations simultaneously and test our approach in simulation.

  Social telepresence robots (i.e., telerobots) are used for social and learning experiences by children. However, most (if not all) commercially available telerobot bodies were designed for adults in corporate or healthcare settings. Due to an adult-focused market, telerobot design has typically not considered important factors such as age and physical aspect in the design of robot bodies. To better understand how peer interactants can facilitate the identities of remote children through personalization of robot bodies, we conducted an exploratory study to evaluate collaborative robot personalization. In this study, child participants (N=28) attended an interactive lesson on robots in our society. After the lesson, participants interacted with two telerobots for personalization activities and a robot fashion show. Finally, participants completed an artwork activity on robot design. Initial findings from this study will inform our continued work on telepresence robots for virtual inclusion and improved educational experiences of remote children and their peers.

  In future confined industrial contexts (hubs), highly automated vehicles and human operators may work in shared spaces and collaborate on joint tasks. This will probably generate a demand for new user interfaces between humans and machines that need to be designed to facilitate high levels of safety and efficiency as well as a positive user experience (UX). The present work investigates the potential of using a combination of voice interaction (VI) and visual augmented reality (AR) to support collaboration between automated vehicles and humans manually operating a machine. A concept using VI and AR for a loading scenario in a logistic center was created and evaluated using a VR headset to provide an immersive experience. A user study with 18 forklift drivers was conducted. Our study shows that the concept generated high scores in terms of usability and UX which indicates a promising potential to use VI and AR to facilitate interaction between human machine operators and unmanned highly automated vehicles when performing collaborative tasks. Our study also implies a need to explore the design and implementation of more complex and social VI for users in logistic centers.  

 Robot Theory of Mind with Reverse Psychology   
 Chuang Yu

  Theory of mind (ToM) corresponds to the human ability to infer other people’s desires, beliefs, and intentions. Acquisition of ToM skills is crucial to obtain a natural interaction between robots and humans. A core component of ToM is the ability to attribute false beliefs. In this paper, a collaborative robot tries to assist a human partner who plays a trust-based card game against another human. The robot infers its partner’s trust in the robot’s decision system via reinforcement learning. Robot ToM refers to the ability to implicitly anticipate the human collaborator’s strategy and inject the prediction into its optimal decision model for a better team performance. In our experiments, the robot learns when its human partner does not trust the robot and consequently gives recommendations in its optimal policy to ensure the effectiveness of team performance. The interesting finding is that the optimal robotic policy attempts to use reverse psychology on its human collaborator when trust is low. This finding will provide guidance for the study of a trustworthy robot decision model with a human partner in the loop.

  Human skeleton-based gesture classification plays a dominant role in social robotics. Learning the variety of human skeleton-based gestures can help the robot to continuously interact in an appropriate manner in a natural human-robot interaction (HRI). In this paper, we proposed a Flow-based model to classify human gesture actions with skeletal data. Instead of inferring new human skeleton actions from noisy data using a retrained model, our end-to-end model can expand the diversity of labels for gesture recognition from noisy data without retraining the model. At first, our model focuses on detecting five human gesture actions (i.e., come on right up, left up, hug, and noise-random action). The accuracy of our online human gesture recognition system is as well as the offline one. Meanwhile, both attain 100% accuracy among the first four actions. Our proposed method is more efficient for inference of new human gesture action without retraining, which acquires about 90% accuracy for noise-random action. The gesture recognition system has been applied to the robot’s reaction toward the human gesture, which is promising to facilitate a natural human-robot interaction.

  With the development of industry 4.0, more collaborative robots are being implemented in manufacturing environments. Hence, research in human-robot interaction (HRI) and human-cobot interaction (HCI) is gaining traction. However, the design of how cobots interact with humans has typically focused on the general able-bodied population, and these interactions are sometimes ineffective for specific groups of users. This study’s goal is to identify interactive differences between hearing and deaf and hard of hearing individuals when interacting with cobots. Understanding these differences may promote inclusiveness by detecting ineffective interactions, reasoning why an interaction failed, and adapting the framework’s interaction strategy appropriately.  

 Transparent Value Alignment   
 Lindsay Sanneman 
  Julie Shah 
  As robots become increasingly prevalent in our communities, aligning the values motivating their behavior with human values is critical. However, it is often difficult or impossible for humans, both expert and non-expert, to enumerate values comprehensively, accurately, and in forms that are readily usable for robot planning. Misspecification can lead to undesired, inefficient, or even dangerous behavior. In the value alignment problem, humans and robots work together to optimize human objectives, which are often represented as reward functions and which the robot can infer by observing human actions. In existing alignment approaches, no explicit feedback about this inference process is provided to the human. In this paper, we introduce an exploratory framework to address this problem, which we call Transparent Value Alignment (TVA). TVA suggests that techniques from explainable AI (XAI) be explicitly applied to provide humans with information about the robot’s beliefs throughout learning, enabling efficient and effective human feedback.  

 Children’s Fundamental Rights in Human-Robot Interaction Research: A Systematic Review

  Citizens and policy institutions increasingly express their concerns regarding the emerging challenges in the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and have concrete demands for the protection of human rights. In parallel, studies in the field of AI and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) indicate the impact of social robots on children’s development. We conducted a systematic review based on UNICEF’s AI Policy Guidance to map the landscape of research on social robots and children’s rights. We used the PRISMA method and identified N=37 papers that address one of the rights, which we then annotated to indicate tendencies and areas of alignment and misalignment with the UNICEF guidance. Our findings reveal that although the field of HRI is looking at specific rights, with a focus on inclusion, some of the rights have been under-researched. Furthermore, we observed a misalignment between HRI and UNICEF regarding the terminology. With this paper, we hope to bring awareness to the field of HRI regarding children’s rights and to highlight directions for alignment among research, societal needs, and policy.  

 Perception-Intention-Action Cycle as a Human Acceptable Way for Improving Human-Robot Collaborative Tasks   
 J. E. Domínguez-Vidal 
  Nicolás Rodríguez 
  Alberto Sanfeliu 
  In Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) tasks, the classical Perception-Action cycle can not fully explain the collaborative behaviour of the human-robot pair until it is extended to Perception-Intention-Action (PIA) cycle, giving to the human’s intention a key role at the same level of the robot’s perception and not as a subblock of this. Although part of the human’s intention can be perceived or inferred by the other agent, this is prone to misunderstandings so the true intention has to be explicitly informed in some cases to fulfill the task. Here, we explore both types of intention and we combine them with the robot’s perception through the concept of Situation Awareness (SA). We validate the PIA cycle and its acceptance by the user with a preliminary experiment in an object transportation task showing that its usage can increase trust in the robot.

  One of the important roles of social robots is to support mental health through conversations with people. In this study, we focused on the column method to support cognitive restructuring, which is also used as one of the programs in psychiatric day care, and to help patients think flexibly and understand their own characteristics. To develop a robot that assists psychiatric day care patients in organizing their thoughts about their worries and goals through conversation, we designed the robot’s conversation content based on the column method and implemented its autonomous conversation function. This paper reports on the preliminary experiments conducted to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of this prototype system in an actual psychiatric day care setting, and on the comments from participants in the experiments and day care staff.  

 Comparison of Attitudes Towards Robots of Different Population Samples in Norway   
 Marten Bloch 
  Alexandra Fernandes 
  Acceptance of robots is known to be directly influenced by perceptions and attitudes potential users have of them. Particularly, negative attitudes can prevent that the implementations of robots unlock their full potential and ultimately fail if negative attitudes are not addressed. We employed the popular Negative Attitude Towards Robots Scale (NARS) across four different studies to assess how different populations in Norway perceive robots. All four included exposure to at least a robot. However, the setup of each individual study was different from the others. We summarized the results across study and made comparisons between the different samples. We also analyzed the effect of gender and age on attitude towards robots as measured by the NARS. The results indicate that there are significant differences between samples and that females score significantly higher than males, thus having a less favorable opinion of robots and potentially avoiding interaction with them. We touch upon possible explanations and implications of our results and highlight the need for more research into this topic.  

 Who’s in Charge?: Using Personalization vs. Customization Distinction to Inform HRI Research on Adaptation to Users   
 Dimitri LACROIX 
  Ricarda Wullenkord 
  Friederike Eyssel 
  This paper presents a conceptual approach regarding robot-to-user adaptation, with a focus on the psychological effects of this adaptation process during human-robot interaction (HRI). This approach emphasizes the pertinent role of users in shaping adaptation processes. First, a literature review revealed perceived personal relevance as the central determinant of successful robot-to-user adaptation. Second, we distinguish two main types of adaptations which depend on the extent to which a user is involved: Personalization and customization. We then illustrate effects of personalization vs. customization on potential end users. In particular, anthropomorphism and psychological ownership should be taken into account in prospective research. Finally, we propose to interpret personalization and customization as two opposites of a continuum to guide future empirical research about robot adaptation, before suggesting some leads for future research about the psychological effects of adaptation processes in HRI.  

 Evaluating Kinect, OpenPose and BlazePose for Human Body Movement Analysis on a Low Back Pain Physical Rehabilitation Dataset

  Adriana Tapus 
  Analyzing human motion is an active research area, with various applications. In this work, we focus on human motion analysis in the context of physical rehabilitation using a robot coach system. Computer-aided assessment of physical rehabilitation entails evaluation of patient performance in completing prescribed rehabilitation exercises, based on processing movement data captured with a sensory system, such as RGB and RGB-D cameras. As 2D and 3D human pose estimation from RGB images had made impressive improvements, we aim to compare the assessment of physical rehabilitation exercises using movement data obtained from both RGB-D camera (Microsoft Kinect) and estimation from RGB videos (OpenPose and BlazePose algorithms). A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is employed from position (and orientation) features, with performance metrics defined based on the log-likelihood values from GMM. The evaluation is performed on a medical database of clinical patients carrying out low back-pain rehabilitation exercises, previously coached by robot Poppy.  

 Towards a Wave Approach for Value Sensitive Design in Social Robotics   
 Theresa Schmiedel 
  Vivienne Jia Zhong 
  Friederike Eyssel 
  Even though a broad range of social robots are currently available on the market, social robots are not yet an integral part of companies, healthcare providers, or public institutions. This might be due to the fact that the prevalent developer perspective immanently focuses on technological advancements, whereas a human-centered view remains underrepresented. In this paper, we argue that a human-centered perspective which integrates values and beliefs of relevant technology stakeholders needs to complement existing approaches to social robot design. Therefore, we propose to apply value sensitive design (VSD) to improve the process of social robot development and design. Even though VSD has become popular in recent years and it represents an established approach to foster innovative technologies, it has not yet been widely applied in the context of social robotics. Concretely, in this paper we will outline the added value of using VSD for social robots and we will explain how to utilize this methodology to enrich research and practice in social robotics.  

 Comparing How Soft Robotic Tentacles and an Equivalent Traditional Robot are Described   
 Jonas Jørgensen 
  Soft robotics technology has several technical benefits and enables inherently safer human-robot interaction (HRI). However, only few studies have addressed how people experience soft robots and how their embodiment and designs can meaningfully support HRI. The present study explores impressions formed in the physical meeting with soft robots. 94 participants interacted with one out of two soft robots or a similar traditional robot. Following interaction, they were asked what they thought the robot resembled and to describe the robot’s appearance using five adjectives. The results show that different categories of items were used to describe each of the three robots’ resemblances. Furthermore, a significant difference in the sentiment of the adjectives used was found – positive adjectives were predominantly used to describe the two soft robots whereas there was an overweight of negative adjectives for the traditional robot.  

 Out of Sight Out of Mind?: Investigating People’s Assumptions About Object Permanence in Self-Driving Cars

  Safe and efficient interaction with autonomous road vehicles requires that human road users, including drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians, understand differences between the capabilities and limitations of self-driving vehicles and those of human drivers. In this study, we explore how people judge the ability of self-driving cars versus human drivers to keep track of out-of-sight objects by engaging online study participants in cognitive perspective taking toward a car in an animated traffic scene. The results indicate that people may expect self-driving cars to have similar object permanence capability as human drivers. This finding is important because unmet expectations on autonomous road vehicles can result in undesirable interaction outcomes, such as traffic accidents.

  One way to address shortages in the workforce and improve the safety of health workers is through robots. Here, we will specifically look at whether and how robots might augment workers working on the pre-analytical phase of clinical testing in hospital laboratories. We conducted eight interviews with workers using futuristic autobiographies. Through our analysis, we identified three themes. Workers envisioned robots to increase their well-being and change blue-collar workers’ tasks towards that of automation operators. The latter was perceived to be a change towards doing more meaningful tasks (cognitive tasks, rather than manual labour). Additionally, workers have a need to better cope with structural changes and temporary fluctuations in the workflow. More general-purpose robots could address this.

  Safe interaction with automated vehicles requires that human road users understand the differences between the capabilities and limitations of human drivers and their artificial counterparts. Here we explore how people judge what self-driving cars versus human drivers can perceive by engaging online study participants in visual perspective taking toward a car pictured in various traffic scenes. The results indicate that people do not expect self-driving cars to differ significantly from human drivers in their capability to perceive objects in the environment. This finding is important because unmet expectations can result in detrimental interaction outcomes, such as traffic accidents. The extent to which people are able to calibrate their expectations remains an open question for future research.  

 Lessons From a Robot Asking for Directions In-the-wild

  Robots operating in human spaces need to be able to communicate with people. Understanding how humans and robots communicate about the shared space around them allows us to build robots that can interact fluidly with others. We performed a field study with a telepresence robot and a perceived autonomous robot to explore how humans give directions to robots and how the interactions differ based on the perceived identity of the robot operator. In this work we present some initial findings from our in-the-wild study including: 1) participants were more considerate to the robot in the telepresence condition, 2) participants considered the sensing and physical limitations of the robot when giving directions, and 3) participants were uncertain about the realness or identity of the robot and the robot operator.

  Persons with Dementia face the issue of a deteriorating memory. As assistive robots are being increasingly adapted as a helper to persons with dementia, this paper presents an additional feature to such robots. Assistive robots that might assist with different tasks in users’ households can also be utilized to track salient objects to quickly find them in case they are misplaced. This paper presents an episodic memory system that can enable a robot to recognize salient objects and track them while moving in and out of the environment. We also demonstrate how to develop access to the robot’s memory in an easy-to-understand way using a graphical user interface (GUI). The proposed system is integrated with a Fetch mobile manipulator robot to track, store and visualize various household objects in an environment. Results from a system evaluation study are encouraging and the system will be further investigated in future co-design and user studies.  

 Social Robots to Encourage Play for Children with Disabilities: Learning Perceived Requirements and Barriers from Family Units

  We are currently conducting a study with children and their family units to learn the requirements for concerns about, barriers to, and opinions on using social robots to facilitate play in children with physical disabilities. The motivation for this work is that children with disabilities often have fewer opportunities and lower playfulness, impacting their cognitive and social development. Simultaneously, social robots provide opportunities for supporting these children to engage in play. To work toward developing these robots, our goal in this work is to improve our understanding of the fundamental needs of the child and their family unit to allow us to be better positioned to develop such a social robot.

  In this paper, we present a proposed format for reporting human studies in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). We call for details which are often overlooked or left out of research papers due to space constraints, and propose a standardized format to contain those details in paper appendices. Providing a formalized study reporting method will promote an increase in replicability and reproducibility of HRI studies and encourage meta-analysis and review, ultimately increasing the generalizability and validity of HRI research. Our draft is the first step towards these goals, and we welcome feedback from the HRI community on the included topics.  

 Rube-Goldberg Machines, Transparent Technology, and the Morally Competent Robot   
 Terran Mott 
  Tom Williams 
  Social robots of the future will need to perceive, reason about, and respond appropriately to ethically sensitive situations. At the same time, policymakers and researchers alike are advocating for increased transparency and explainability in robotics-design principles that help users build accurate mental models and calibrate trust. In this short paper, we consider how Rube Goldberg machines might offer a strong analogy on which to build transparent user interfaces for the intricate, but knowable inner workings of a cognitive architecture’s moral reasoning. We present a discussion of these related concepts, a rationale for the suitability of this analogy, and early designs for an initial prototype visualization.  

 TIP: A Trust Inference and Propagation Model in Multi-Human Multi-Robot Teams

  Trust has been identified as a central factor for effective human-robot teaming. Existing literature on trust modeling predominantly focuses on dyadic human-autonomy teams where one human agent interacts with one robot. There is little, if not no, research on trust modeling in teams consisting of multiple human agents and multiple robotic agents. To fill this research gap, we present the trust inference and propagation (TIP) model for trust modeling in multi-human multi-robot teams. We assert that in a multi-human multi-robot team, there exist two types of experiences that any human agent has with any robot: direct and indirect experiences. The TIP model presents a novel mathematical framework that explicitly accounts for both types of experiences. To evaluate the model, we conducted a human-subject experiment with 15 pairs of participants (N=30). Each pair performed a search and detection task with two drones. Results show that our TIP model successfully captured the underlying trust dynamics and significantly outperformed a baseline model. To the best of our knowledge the TIP model is the first mathematical framework for computational trust modeling in multi-human multi-robot teams.  

 Comparing a Graphical User Interface, Hand Gestures and Controller in Virtual Reality for Robot Teleoperation

  Robot teleoperation is being explored in a number of application areas, where combining human adaptive intelligence and high precision of robots can provide access to dangerous or inaccessible places, or augment human dexterity. Using virtual reality (VR) is one way to enable robot teleoperation, where additional information can be augmented in the display to make the remote control easier. In this paper, we present a robot teleoperation system, developed and deployed on a JAKA Minicobo robotic arm, to compare the user experience and performance for three different control methods. These include a VR controller, VR gestures and a traditional graphical user interface (GUI). Each study participant was asked to conduct the experiment twice using all three methods, during which the time, the total spatial distance of the robot end-effector movement, and the frequency of errors in a teleoperation task were recorded for quantitative analysis. All participants were also asked to complete a questionnaire based on the NASA task load index. The results show that overall the VR gestures method enables users to complete the task faster than the VR controller, and using the traditional GUI is generally slower. While the quantitative results do not show statistically significant differences, both of the VR methods place greater perceived physical and mental demands on the users, in comparison to the GUI, although when asked which method they preferred, only three of the sixteen participants preferred the VR gestures method. Given that a number of applications use VR, this study indicates that if the task is not time critical, then a traditional GUI might be more suitable for reducing perceived mental and physical load, and controller-free VR interaction might not always be desirable.  

 A Persuasive Hand Sanitizer Robot in the Wild: The Effect of Persuasive Speech on the Use of a Hand Sanitizer Robot   
 Franziska Fischer 
  Kerstin Fischer 
  Oskar Palinko 
  In this paper, we report on field tests of a hand sanitizer robot, which tracks people’s movements using gaze and which uses several different persuasive utterances when people are approaching. Our results show that adding speech made people significantly more aware of the opportunity of using hand sanitizer, but that people do not use the hand sanitizer more often than with eye gaze only. Furthermore, the different utterances themselves did not lead to significant differences in attention or use, in spite of their effectiveness in other situations.  

 More Than a Number: A Multi-dimensional Framework For Automatically Assessing Human Teleoperation Skill   
 Emily Jensen 
  Bradley Hayes 
  Sriram Sankaranarayanan 
  We present a framework for the formal evaluation of human teleoperator skill level in a systematic fashion aiming to quantify how skillful a particular operator is for a well-defined task. Our proposed framework has two parts. First, the tasks used to evaluate skill levels are decomposed into a series of domain-specific primitives, each with a formal specification using signal temporal logic. Secondly, skill levels are automatically evaluated along multiple dimensions rather than a singular number. These dimensions include robustness, efficiency, resilience and readiness for each primitive task. We provide an initial evaluation for the task of taking-off, hovering, and landing in a drone simulator. This preliminary evaluation shows the value of a multi-dimensional evaluation of human operator performance.  

 Examining the State of Robot Identity

  Katie Winkle 
  Human-robot interaction has the power to influence human norms and culture. While there is potential benefit in using this power to create positive social change, so too is there risk in merely reinforcing existing social biases which uphold systems of oppression. As the most salient forms of oppression arise along lines of social identity, it stands to reason that we must take utmost care in leveraging human-like identity cues when designing social robots and other agentic embodiments. Yet, the understanding of how to do this is not well-developed. Towards forming an ethics of robot identity, we begin by surveying the state of thought on the topic in human-robot interaction. We do this by conducting a structured review of HRI conference proceedings analyzed from a feminist, intersectional perspective. Our initial findings suggest that existing literature has not fully engaged with intersectionality, embodies an alarming pathologization of neurodivergence, and almost wholly neglects the examination of race.  

 M-OAT Shared Meta-Model Framework for Effective Collaborative Human-Autonomy Teaming   
 Audrey L. Aldridge 
  Cindy L. Bethel 
  Integrating humans and autonomous machines in teams for the successful completion of complex, multi-objective tasks in dynamic or unknown environments can help improve the safety and efficiency of team members. For effective cooperation, human-machine teams require understanding team members’ unique potentials interdependent decision-making, and trust among all team members. To develop a framework that supports the human-machine teaming required of complex, multi-objective tasks, shared mental models, cognitive representations, and multi-directional trust calibration need to be investigated. Providing a shared mental model, cognitive load understanding, and situational awareness to agents allows human-machine teams to adapt to shortcomings and unexpected environmental threats, independently or conjointly make time-sensitive decisions, and improve safety of team members and efficiency of task performance. The goal of our research is to create a multi-objective decision-support framework that encourages the incorporation of trusted autonomous systems for effective cooperation in ad-hoc heterogeneous collaborative teams.  

 “Can You Guess My Moves?: Playing Charades with a Humanoid Robot Employing Mutual Learning with Emotional Intelligence   
 Baijun Xie 
  Chung Hyuk Park 
  Social play is essential in human interactions, increasing social bonding, mitigating stress, and relieving anxiety. With advancements in robotics, social robots can employ this role to assist in human-robot interaction scenarios for clinical and healthcare purposes. However, robotic intelligence still needs further development to match the wide spectrum of social behaviors and contexts in human interactions. In this paper we present our robotic intelligence framework with a mutual learning paradigm in which we apply deep learning based on emotion recognition and behavior perception, through which the robot learns human movements and contexts through the interactive game of charades. Furthermore, we designed a gesture-based social game to provide a more empathetic and engaging social robot for the user. We also created a custom behavior database containing contextual behaviors for the proposed social games. A pilot study was conducted with participants ranging in age from 12 to 19 for a preliminary evaluation.

  The present study examines the influences of a robot recommender system on human impulse buying tendency in online e-commerce contexts. An empirical user study was conducted, where different marketing strategies (limited quantity vs. discount rate) were applied to the products and intimate designs were utilized for the robotic agent. An electroencephalogram (EEG) headset was used to capture users’ brain activities, which allowed us to investigate participants’ real-time cognitive perceptions toward different experimental conditions (i.e., marketing plans and robotic agents). Our preliminary results reveal that marketing strategies and robot recommender applications can trigger impulsive buying behavior and contribute to different cognitive activities.

  This works addresses the lately initiated Cyrillic-to-Latin alphabet shift in Kazakhstan that may bring challenges for early literacy development and acquisition; both public and scientific communities agree on possible resistance to acquiring and using a new alphabet. To support the acquisition of the new Kazakh Latin alphabet and its handwriting, this study proposes a reinforcement-learning (RL) system named QWriter. It comprises a humanoid robot NAO, a tablet with a stylus, and an RL agent that learns from a child’s mistakes and progresses to maximize alphabet learning in the shortest amount of time by altering the order of practice words in response to a child’s mistakes. We conducted a five-sessions experiment using a between-subject design with 69 Kazakh children ages 7 to 10 and compared their learning performance with a human tutor to assess the effectiveness of the QWriter system. Overall results show no significant differences in learning gains between the two conditions. Our study foregrounds the promising potential of the RL-based social robot in teaching foundational letter acquisition and writing over time.

  Drones are continually entering our daily lives by being used in a number of different applications. This creates a natural demand for better interaction ways between humans and drones. One of the possible applications that would benefit from improved interaction is the inspection of smoking in prohibited areas. We propose our own gesture of drone flight that we believe would deliver the message “not to smoke” better than the ready-made built-in gesture. To this end, we conducted a within-subject experiment involving 19 participants, where we evaluated the gestures on a drone operated through the Wizard-of-Oz interaction design. The results demonstrate that the proposed gesture was better at conveying the message compared to the built-in gesture.

  There are numerous strategies for reducing the stress and anxiety associated with pain that children experience before and after surgery. There is a potential communication barrier between hospital staff and the child which may result in inadequate pain management. Social robots may reduce the gap between the support that personnel can provide and what the children’s emotional needs are. This study qualitatively evaluates the interactions between children and their parents who interact with the social robot MiRo-E. In the overall interaction, the robot would act like a pet and show different behaviours based on the estimated pain level of the children. However, in the current study, only the quality of the robot interaction behaviours was tested with healthy children and no pain was measured. During this study, two usability tests were done. Each usability test evaluated a different robot interaction. In both tests, children and their parents evaluated the designed interactions. Results indicate that children initially have different responses to the robot. They can either be held back from immediately interacting or they are not afraid of the robot at all and start touching it and interacting immediately. Although the intended behaviours could be more elaborate and personalized, both children and their parents appeared to like the different emotions shown by the robot and how it responded to their touch. The parents also offered some ideas to enhance the interaction between a child and a robot in a medical context, such as by including more sounds, making some behaviours more distinct, and allowing kids to customize the robot’s look.

  The transition of the Kazakh alphabet from Cyrillic to Latin, set to be fully implemented by 2031, poses unwanted challenges to early and continuous literacy development and acquisition of the new script. This creates a need to design innovative learning solutions to boost children’s motivation in acquiring the new Kazakh Latin alphabet. The Montessori method has proven itself effective for young children to engage in self-directed and developmentally appropriate literacy acquisition. These core ideas have been carefully adopted to establish design principles for the robotic system that is adhering to the principles of the Montessori pedagogy. This paper proposes a robotic system named Moveable -l-pbi and details its interaction design life cycle from understanding users and establishing requirements to designing, and implementing robot behaviours and validating them with the Montessori practitioner. This process was iterative that involved several cycles of piloting the system with children of targeted age groups and redesigning the learning activities. With the aim to evaluate the proposed system and to find the most cognitively rewarding way of learning the alphabet, we conducted a mixed-subject design experiment with 60 Kazakh children aged 8-10 years old from a local public school where we compare the proposed Moveable -l-pbi robotic system with a baseline Montessori human teacher. The results demonstrate the potential of the robot as a Montessori teacher in providing foundational letter acquisition over multiple sessions. Implications for improving the interaction design and activities are discussed based on the findings.

  Reciprocal Peer Tutoring (RPT) is a learning paradigm characteristic of collaborative interaction between learners with alternating tutor-tutee roles. In recent years, robot-assisted language learning (RALL) has gained traction by its wide application for learning language skills, such as speaking or writing, using social robots. Our work aims at exploring the effectiveness of RPT in learning Kazakh as a second language with the help of two robots acting either as a tutee or a tutor. To this end, we piloted a within-subject experiment with 21 children aged 8 and 9 years old from a primary school with Kazakh and Russian languages of instruction. The results show that the tutor robot was more effective in terms of learning gains, while the tutee robot brought positive emotional experiences.

  As a step towards designing a home robot to support older adults’ ikigai (meaning in life), we interviewed the family members who provide care for them. After conducting interviews with ten family caregivers in Japan we found that older adults’ physical health is a major concern to both caregivers and older adults. However concerns over loneliness were not prioritized by caregivers, though they did perceive older adults’ worries around this issue. Additionally, caregivers saw a number of ways a social robot could be designed to address this, as well as its ability to go beyond loneliness in promoting more fulfilling lives among older adults. Finally, we conclude that an ikigai robot may be designed to support both the ikigai of older adults and (indirectly) their family caregivers.  

 Lying About Lying: Examining Trust Repair Strategies After Robot Deception in a High-Stakes HRI Scenario

  Reiden John Allen Webber

  This work presents an empirical study into robot deception and its effects on changes in behavior and trust in a high-stakes, time-sensitive human-robot interaction scenario. Specifically, we explore the effectiveness of different apologies to repair trust in an assisted driving task after participants realize they have been lied to by a robotic assistant. Our results show that participants are significantly more likely to change their speeding behaviors when driving advice is framed as coming from a robotic assistant. Our results also suggest an apology without acknowledging intentional deception is best at mitigating negative influences on trust. These results add much needed knowledge to the understudied area of robot deception and could inform designers and policy makers of future practices when considering deploying robots that may learn to deceive.

  Teaching methods are developing rapidly, offering different ways of teaching languages. The more recent ones are robot-assisted language learning and gamification of learning. There is a great body of research related to teaching English as a second/foreign language to children with the help of technology. Most of these studies integrating robots into the learning process showed that they positively affect the learning process and increase the learning gains of children. This study introduces a robot-assisted word-to-picture matching game for English learning in two different modes. This work aims to propose a robot-assisted game-based English learning activity and compare its two versions: a standard version and a priority selection version. To this end, a within-subject experiment was conducted in which a total of 17 children aged 7 to 8 years old participated. The experiment compared the children’s knowledge after each version of the game. The results showed a significant difference in learning gains between the question priority algorithm and the standard game.

  Social robots have been shown to effectively promote healthy behaviour in humans. In the context of the pandemic, these robots have been used to encourage the use of face masks and other bio-safety measures. However, human perception in these scenarios is yet to be assessed. This study evaluates the effectiveness of using a social robot, specifically the NAO robot, to promote face-mask usage in public spaces with a hybrid experiment. The methodology involves an in-person study, as well as an online survey. The results show that the robot was able to detect correct face-mask usage with 95% accuracy, and 87.5% of participants had a positive experience interacting with the robot. Statistical results also suggest that the users perceiving a human-robot interaction scenario through a pre-recorded video can perceive differently the robot’s trust safety, and intelligence, among others. These findings suggest that social robots can be a valuable tool for promoting health and safety measures, not only during the pandemic but in other collaborative environments as well.  

 Technical Transparency for Robot Navigation Through AR Visualizations

  Since robots can facilitate our everyday life by assisting us in basic tasks, they are continuously integrated into our life. However, for a robot to establish itself, a user must accept and trust its doing. As the saying goes, you don’t trust things you don’t understand. Therefore, the base hypothesis of this paper is that providing technical transparency for users can increase understanding of the robot architecture and its behaviors as well as trust and acceptance towards it. In this work, we aim to improve a robot’s understanding trust, and acceptance by displaying transparent visualizations of its intention and perception in augmented reality. We conducted a user study where robot navigation with certain interruptions was demonstrated to two groups. The first group did not have AR visualizations displayed during the first demonstration; in the second demonstration, the visualizations were shown. The second group had the visualizations displayed throughout only one demonstration. Results showed that understanding increased with AR visualizations when prior knowledge had been gained in previous demonstrations.

  Parents may inadvertently promote excess weight gain in childhood by using inappropriate child-feeding behaviors. This study presents the design of a home robot in a parent-child feeding scenario. Designed for parents who have difficulty quantifying the amount of food their children, it helps them quantify calorie intake through pneumatic feedback and gives real-time feedback and intervention by recognizing feeding behaviors. It aims to create a more intuitive link between scientific quantification standards and actual eating scenarios by a pneumatic device in the form of a peripheral interaction. Based on our current prototype development, we have sought to explore the effectiveness of peripheral interactions with physical robotic interventions in user behavior.  

 SESSION: HRI Pioneers  
 Enabling Human-like Language-Capable Robots Through Working Memory Modeling   
 Rafael Sousa Silva 
  Tom Williams 
  Working Memory (WM) is a central component of cognition. It has direct impact not only on core cognitive processes, such as learning, comprehension, and reasoning, but also language-related processes, such as natural language understanding and referring expression generation. Thus, for robots to achieve human-like natural language capabilities, we argue that their cognitive models should include an accurate WM representation that plays a similarly central role. Our research investigates how different WM models from cognitive psychology affect robots’ natural language capabilities. Specifically, we explore the limited capacity nature of WM and how different information forgetting strategies, namely decay and interference impact the human-likeness of utterances formulated by robots.  

 Adaptive Robotic Mental Well-being Coaches

  Hatice Gunes 
  Mental well-being issues such as anxiety and depression are increasing, and as provisions by healthcare systems are insufficient to meet people’s needs, new technology is being used to improve mental well-being. In this doctoral thesis, we examine the iterative and user-centred design, implementation and evaluation of a robotic mental well-being coach – i.e., a robot that could help people maintain and focus on their well-being. In this article, we discuss the studies we have already conducted. These have examined coach and user preferences, the design of a robotic well-being coach, how to computationally implement such a coach, and how such a robot is experienced in the short (laboratory setting) and long term (workplace setting). We then discuss future work, which includes data analysis of a longitudinal study where a robotic coach interacted with a group, the implementation and testing of an longitudinal adaptation model for the robotic coach, and a survey of the state of the art in affective robotics for well-being.  

 Supporting End-Users in Programming Collaborative Robots   
 Gopika Ajaykumar 
  End-user robot programming methods have come a long way in enabling users who do not have conventional robotics training to customize robot behaviors. However, such methods can still be difficult to adopt for untrained users. In this abstract, I describe my work towards designing tailored support to reduce barriers preventing end-users from programming collaborative robots.  

 Socially Assistive Robotics for Anxiety Reduction   
 Kayla Matheus 
  Prior work in HRI for domains such as exercise, rehabilitation, and autism has shown how socially assistive robots (SARs) can successfully support behavioral practices. Applying these insights to mental health is an opportunity to support a large and growing population that is actively struggling. My research investigates utilizing SARs for supporting the therapeutic behavior of deep breathing for anxiety reduction. My prior work to date has focused on the design affordances required for an anxious population through the development of a new, haptically-based robot, Ommie. Future work explores how SARs for anxiety-reducing behaviors can maximize long-term, in-the-wild use through haptic interactions, perception technologies, and personalized motivational mechanisms.  

 Aligning Robot Behaviors with Human Intents by Exposing Learned Behaviors and Resolving Misspecifications   
 Serena Booth 
  Human-robot interaction is limited in large part by the challenge of writing correct specifications for robots. The research community wants alignment between humans’ goals and robot behaviors, but this alignment is very hard to achieve. My research tackles this problem. I view alignment as the consequence of iterative design and ample testing, and I design methods in service of these processes. I first study how humans currently write reward functions, and I profile some of the typical errors they make when doing so. I then study how humans can inspect the behaviors robots learn from any given specification. A typical approach to this mandates unstructured or hand-designed test cases; I instead introduce a Bayesian inference method for finding behavior examples which cover information-rich test cases. Alongside finding these behavior examples I study how these examples should be presented to the human through applying cognitive theories of human concept learning. For the remainder of my thesis, I am pursuing two open questions. My first question concerns how these components can be combined such that humans are able to iteratively design better behavioral specifications. My second question concerns how robots can better interpret humans’ erroneous specifications and attempt to infer their true intent, in spite of the errors.  

 Investigating the Potential of Life-like Haptic Cues for Socially Assistive Care Robots   
 Jacqueline Borgstedt 
  Physical touch (e.g., hugging, holding hands, petting an animal) plays a fundamental role in the provision of socio-emotional support. Touch-based interactions should thus be considered for socially assistive robots designed to provide similar support. However, the haptic properties of currently existing robots are limited. While research has shown possibilities of integrating life-like haptic cues (e.g., thermal, vibrotactile pressure cues) into robotic interfaces, current understanding of user experiences with life-like haptic cues delivered by a robot, and their potential to regulate user affect, is insufficient. The current and proposed works investigate whether integrating life-like haptic cues into Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) can enhance the socio-emotional support provided by socially assistive robots and improve the relationships with, and perceptions of such robots. The findings of this work will provide insights into user experiences of touching a socially assistive robot and their perceptions of life-like haptic cues. The contributions will provide concrete design suggestions on how haptic cues can be integrated into interfaces of socially assistive robots to enhance users’ well-being during stress-inducing situations  

 Measuring Trust in Children’s Speech: Towards Responsible Robot-Supported Information Search   
 Ella Velner 
  Children use conversational agents, such as Alexa or Siri, to search for information, but also tend to trust these agents which might influence their information assessment. It is challenging for children to assess the veracity of information retrieved from the internet and social media, possibly more so when they trust a voice agent excessively. In this project, I propose to design child-robot interactions to empower children to have a critical attitude by implementing real-time trust monitoring and robot behavioural interventions in cases of high trust. First, we need to be able to measure children’s level of trust in the robot real-time during the interaction, to reason about when excessive trust may be occurring. Second, we need to study what behavioural interventions by the robot foster critical attitudes toward the provided information. By adapting the robot’s behavior when excessive trust occurs, I aim to contribute to more responsible interactions between children and robots.

  Collaborative robots have the potential to be intelligent, embodied agents that can contribute to remote human collaboration. We explore this paradigm through the design of robot-mounted camera systems for remote assistance.

 Robot Sound-In-Interaction   
 Hannah R. M. Pelikan 
  Sound is an important interaction modality in human interaction, which robot design is only starting to tap into. Drawing on insights about how human sounds support coordination of bodily activities, this work focuses on how robots can communicate through sound in concrete interactions in the wild. My work contributes a focus on how users make sense of sound in everyday interaction, promotes re-consideration of what HRI is designing for and stimulates the development of new HRI design methods.  

 Social Network Engagement during Human-robot Interaction: An Extended Abstract on a Fundamental Novel Field within Human-robot Interaction   
 Ann Hogenhuis 
  The improvement of natural and intuitive interaction is currently one of the major challenges for studies of human-robot interaction. Although the sector has advanced technologically to astonishing levels, the integration of these robots into our social environment frequently still feels rusty. People are often reluctant to communicate with robots on a regular basis because they feel uneasy or distrustful of them. As a result, conversing with an agent from a novel embodiment raises significant questions about human social interaction in general. How do people connect, or how does interaction result in the social relationship that is viewed as the ultimate aim? My goal is to systematically investigate the neural mechanisms of social behaviour during human-robot interaction. Specifically, my aim is to investigate the social domain-general networks in the brain that form the underpinnings of communication. While cutting-edge research techniques such as simultaneous scanning and real-time measurements, have been used in neuroscientific research to study human-human interaction, the extension of neuroscience towards human-robot interaction is surprisingly novel. I therefore want to contribute to the human-robot interaction field with the methods from neuroscience using an interdisciplinary, naturalistic, and replicable approach.  

 Balancing Flexibility and Precision in Robot-assisted Feeding   
 Ethan K. Gordon 
  Assistive robots can empower those with mobility impairments, but they must manage the trade-off between safety, efficacy, and comfort. For some task dimensions, there is flexibility: humans can shake robot hands anywhere within reach. For others, precision is key: too hard of a handshake can lead to injury. This distinction is critical for particularly intimate tasks like feeding. A robot feeding system needs to explore when there is flexibility, optimizing for success and user preferences, while maintaining the precision necessary to avoid destroying food or harming the user. Here, we propose a hierarchical approach. We design strategies and heuristics based on user feedback to abstract away the precise dimensions of bite acquisition and transfer. We can deploy learning algorithms relatively safely the resulting curated action subspace. Within the next year, we expect this work to culminate in a week-long in-home deployment with a user and co-designer.  

 Collaborative Planning and Negotiation in Human-Robot Teams   
 Christine T. Chang 
  Mitchell Hebert 
  Bradley Hayes 
  Our work aims to apply iterative communication techniques to improve functionality of human-robot teams working in space and other high-risk environments. Forms of iterative communication include progressive incorporation of human preference and otherwise latent task specifications. Our prior work found that humans would choose not to comply with robot-provided instructions and then proceed to self-justify their choices despite the risks of physical harm and blatant disregard for rules. Results clearly showed that humans working near robots are willing to sacrifice safety for efficiency. Current work aims to improve communication by iteratively incorporating human preference into optimized path planning for human-robot teams operating over large areas. Future work will explore the extent to which negotiation can be used as a mechanism for improving task planning and joint task execution for humans and robots.  

 Using Justifications to Mitigate Loss in Human Trust when Robots Perform Norm – Violating and Deceptive Behaviors   
 Andres Rosero 
  Robots are increasingly being introduced in environments that require intimate and sensitive interactions with humans, ranging from robot caretakers in senior living facilities to medical assistants in hospitals, and as team members embedded in military operations. For robots to be trusted and accepted in interactions with humans, they must be aware of, follow, and prioritize the norms of the communities in which they will operate. This line of research aims to examine human perceptions of justifications presented by robots that exhibit norm-violating and deceptive behaviors. Across two studies, we examined human trust and moral blame ratings of robots violating social norms and the effects of justifications in mitigating initial perceptions. We aim to expand our research to emphasize deceptive robotic acts — providing quantifiable evidence for the “deception objection” debate in social robotics literature.  

 Investigating Learning from Demonstration in Imperfect and Real World Scenarios   
 Erin Hedlund-Botti 
  Matthew C. Gombolay 
  As the world’s population is aging and there are growing shortages of caregivers, research into assistive robots is increasingly important. Due to differing needs and preferences, which may change over time end-users will need to be able to communicate their preferences to a robot. Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is one method that enables non-expert users to program robots. While a powerful tool, prior research in LfD has made assumptions that break down in real-world scenarios. In this work, we investigate how to learn from suboptimal and heterogeneous demonstrators, how users react to failure with LfD, and the feasibility of LfD with a target population of older adults.  

 Resolving References in Natural Language Explanation Requests about Robot Behavior in HRI   
 Florian Schröder 
  Sonja Stange 
  Stefan Kopp 
  In HRI, users have been shown to request explanations when their interpretation of autonomous robot behavior fails. These requests can refer to the behavior either by open questions or with attributes of the behavior. The presented work aims to resolve these references in explanation requests by developing an episodic memory with a graph database that stores and queries representations of the internal execution. The reference resolution is done by the detection of temporal adverb and verb constraints in the syntactical dependency tree of utterances, the execution of a query in the episodic memory, and the scoring of the resulting entries to find the referred behavior. The explanation generation process of the original model is adapted to the new approach and can contain additional information such as detected constraints, a failed execution state, and the distinction between running and completed executions.  

 Longitudinal Proactive Robot Assistance   
 Maithili Patel 
  Studies show that users value proactivity in robotic assistance, but mobile manipulators today require exact task descriptions, and can proactively assist only the user’s ongoing activity. Through this research project I formulate and advance the problem of longitudinal proactive assistance, which seeks to carry out assistive actions in advance and without being asked, by understanding the human user’s needs and preferences in context of the environment over long time horizons. My research aims to enable autonomous robots to utilize multimodal data from passive observations to understand routine lives of human users, and interact with the human user to communicate its reasoning and actively seek feedback.  

 Development of a Wearable Robot that Moves on the Arm to Support the Daily Life of the User   
 Koji Kimura 
  Fumihide Tanaka 
  Wearable robots can maintain physical contact with the user and interact with them to assist in daily life. However, since most wearable robots operate at a single point on the user’s body, the user must be constantly aware of their presence. This imposes a burden on the user, both physically and mentally, and prevents them from wearing the robot daily. One solution to this problem is for the robot to move around the user’s body. When the user does not interact with the robot, it can move to an unobtrusive position and attract less attention from the user. This research aims to develop a wearable robot that reduces the burden by developing an arm movement mechanism for wearable robots and a self-localization method for autonomous movement and helps the user’s daily life by providing supportive interactions.  

 Perceived Appropriateness: A Novel View for Remediating Perceived Inappropriate Robot Navigation Behaviors   
 Yunzhong Zhou 
  Robots navigating in social environments inevitably exhibit behavior perceived as inappropriate by people which they will repeat unless they are aware of them; hindering their social acceptance. This highlights the importance of robots detecting and adapting to the perceived appropriateness of their behavior, in line with what we found in a systematic literature review. Therefore, we have conducted experiments (both outdoor and indoor) to understand the perceived appropriateness of robot social navigation behavior, based on which we collected a dataset and developed a machine learning model for detecting such perceived appropriateness. To investigate the usefulness of such information and inspire robot adaptive navigation behavior design, we will further conduct a WoZ study to understand how trained human operators adapt robot behavior to people’s feedback. In all, this work will enable robots to better remediate their inappropriate behavior, thus improving their social acceptance.  

 Social Robots to Encourage Play for Children with Physical Disabilities: Learning from Family Units   
 Raquel Thiessen 
  Children with disabilities have fewer opportunities and lower motivation for play, impacting their cognitive and social de-velopment. Leveraging co-design and participatory design we plan to conduct a study with children with physical disabili-ties and their families to learn the requirements, concerns, barriers, and opinions about using social robots to facilitate play in children with physical disabilities. Combining the in-sights gathered from the families with knowledge from litera-ture, we hope to outline the requirements needed to direct fu-ture research with a grounded understanding of the practical and social landscape these social robots would need to be de-signed within.

  Jessie Wong 
  Toasting bread is a seemingly mundane task that people perform on a daily basis, whether in a private kitchen area or in a communal dining space. This paper presents a robotic toaster, or “toaster bot”, that is designed with animated movements to enhance the toast-making experience by not only assisting in completing the task itself but also by acting as a playful entity with whom users may interact. Furthermore, we aim to explore different roles and behaviors for the robotic toaster and how they are understood by the users.  

 Internet of Robotic Cat Toys to Deepen Bond and Elevate Mood   
 Isla Xi Han 
  Sarah Witzman 
  Pets provide important mental support for human beings. Recent advancements in robotics and HRI have led to research and commercial products providing smart solutions to enrich indoor pets’ lives. However, most of these products focus on satisfying pets’ basic needs, such as feeding and litter cleaning, rather than their mental well-being. In this paper, we present the internet of robotic cat toys, where a group of robotic agents connects to play with our furry friends. Through three iterations, we demonstrate an affordable and flexible design of clip-on robotic agents to transform a static household into an interactive wonderland for pets.

  Sirin Liukasemsarn 
  Music brings people together; it is a universal language that can help us be more expressive and help us understand our feelings and emotions in a better manner. The “Hospiano” robot is a prototype developed with the goal of making music accessible to all, regardless of physical ability. The robot acts as a pianist and can be placed in hospital lobbies and wards, playing the piano in response to the gestures and facial expressions of patients (i.e. head movement, eye and mouth movement, and proximity). It has three main modes of operation: “Robot Pianist mode”, in which it plays pre-existing songs; “Play Along mode”, which allows anyone to interact with the music; and “Composer mode”, which allows patients to create their own music. The software that controls the prototype’s actions runs on the Robot Operating System (ROS). It has been proven that humans and robots can interact fluently via a robot’s vision, which opens up a wide range of possibilities for further interactions between these logical machines and more emotive beings like humans resulting in an improvement in the quality of life of people who use it, increased inclusivity, and a better world for future generations to live in.  

 Aimoji, an Affordable Interaction Kit that Upcycles Used Toy as Companion Robot   
 Aoi Minamoto 
  Zitao Zhang 
  When a child wants to talk with a toy, usually it is a one-way interaction with the child imagining the toy’s responses. Our design enables every toy to have a two-way interaction using our low-cost interaction kit. The reaction of the toy is based on a motion-sensor that triggers the toy to respond to the child through a screen attached to the toy. Through this method, every child can experience Human-Robot Interaction in an affordable way. There can be as many robots as the number of toys.

  Yahan Xie 
  Inappropriate child-feeding behaviors are one of the causes of childhood obesity or stomach problems. Children from 1 to 5 years old don’t know how much they should eat and parents may not know whether their children are full or not. Therefore, we designed a robot in a parent-child feeding scenario that visualizes children’s daily diet through changes in its form. It aims to establish a more intuitive connection between scientific quantitative standards and actual feeding scenarios in the form of peripheral interaction. Thus solving the problem of real-time feedback in feeding.

  Yoonjoung Kwak 
  Byounghern Kim 
  Hui Sung Lee 
  It is difficult for humans to express their pain confidently. Generally, communication between patients and caregivers is important, but there are difficulties of interaction with existing methods. We propose an assistive robot, ALH-E, that consists of squeezable input device and wriggling output device for pain communication. The patients can log their pain by squeezing, and the output device can express the patient’s pain intensity through dynamic wriggling movements. Human-robot interaction with ALH-E can be an assistive communication of pain between the patients and caregivers in the insufficient environment. This paper presents our development of the device and new interaction.  

 Smart Transformer Health Monitoring System   
 Ali Ahmed 
  Dependency on electricity is currently at an all-time high with power distribution being a key element. Currently, the maintenance and monitoring methodologies especially in Pakistan revolve around taking on-field samples (DGA) which is overall primitive and prone to human error. This research paper presents a smart device that can monitor transformer’s health using AI and relay that health score to a remote dashboard through the Internet of Things (IoT). The device uses a combination of single board computer, embedded systems, and communication protocols and is designed to detect and diagnose any issues with the transformer and alert the user in real time. The results of this research show that the device is an effective and reliable tool for extrusive monitoring of health of transformer.  

 BeeBot: A Robot that Help Children Manage Their Blood Glucose in a Friendly Way   
 Abigail Osorio 
  Sebastian Caballa 
  Obesity is a major problem affecting children around the world. In many cases this condition leads to an even more serious disease, diabetes, a condition for which the child and his or her family must create new habits and purchase medical devices. BeeBot is an affordable robot that helps children with diabetes and obesity who are unfamiliar with or afraid of using a glucometer. It incorporates a glucometer and, in addition, includes a counter to capture the number of glasses of water to be consumed and a special button that, when pressed, will advise the child on the exercise he or she can do. Finally, it has two buttons that the child can press depending on whether or not the child has met the day’s goal, whether it is the number of glasses of water or the recommended exercise. All the information can be monitored by the parent through an app.

 Utility Belt for an Agricultural Robot: Reflections on Performing Design Research in the Field   
 Natalie Friedman 
  Asmita Mehta 
  Wendy Ju 
  By performing design research in the field, designers can better understand the target context, needs values, and concerns of their users, and iterate on potential solutions. This, in turn, helps designers apply their work to unexplored territories. We illustrate the opportunities and requirements of this method through a case study of the development of a multi-purpose utility belt for an agriculture robot. We benefited from being able to observe current practices, collaborating to test prototypes with on-site roboticists and farmers, and sharing documentation in the moment. On the other hand, it could be challenging to improvise space for the design work or to find the right times to interrupt locals, and to negotiate the documentation activity with people who have concerns about being recorded.  

 Trash Barrel Robots in the City

  Wendy Ju 
  We deployed two trash barrel robots in New York City to study people’s interactions with autonomous everyday objects in public spaces. We used a Wizard-of-Oz technique for in-the-wild deployment to simulate robots’ autonomy and elicit natural interaction behaviors. This work extends previous research on trash barrel robots toward multi-robot interactions in an urban environment. Our video shows that people in public generally welcome the robots, that the robots encourage social interaction among strangers, that people feel pressure to generate garbage for the robots, and that people’s interactions assume the robots’ awareness of each other.  

 Demonstrating TRAinAR: An Augmented Reality Tool that Helps Humans Teach Robots   
 Andre Cleaver 
  Jivko Sinapov 
  We demonstrate TrainAR, an augmented reality (AR)-based tool that is designed to improve sim2real reinforcement learning (RL) for robots. Users with TRAinAR can tailor a virtual training environment with constraints to match the real-world, visualize training data to gain insights into an agent’s learning process, and animate a robot’s future actions before execution. The system described here enabled a robotic arm manipulator to learn how to navigate its end-effector toward a target object. The novelty of our AR application will hopefully enable users to better train a robot by quickly prototyping complex environments that are difficult to model.  

 Anomaly Detection for Dynamic Human-Robot Assembly: Application of an LSTM-based autoencoder to interpret uncertain human behavior in HRC   
 Fabian Schirmer 
  Philipp Kranz 
  Jan Schmitt 
  Tobias Kaupp 
  Human action recognition is one of the key challenges in human-robot collaboration (HRC), especially when the process has multiple valid ways to assemble a product. To address this problem, we developed an anomaly detection framework for the assembly of complex products. We used an Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM)-based autoencoder to detect anomalies in human behavior and post-process the output to categorize it as a green or red anomaly. A green anomaly represents a deviation from the intended order but a valid assembly sequence. A red anomaly represents an invalid sequence. In both cases, the worker is guided to complete the assembly process.

  Over 1.8 million Americans require assistance eating. Robot-assisted feeding is a promising way to empower people with motor impairments to eat independently. Yet, most robot-assisted feeding research has focused on individual dining (e.g., eating at home with a caregiver), but not social dining (e.g., family meals, friends’ brunch, romantic dates). What happens when a robot developed for individual contexts gets used in social contexts? In this humorous video, we present unintended consequences that can arise from robot-assisted feeding in social settings. This video aims to raise awareness about the importance of accounting for social context when designing assistive robots.

  Rerun is a software system to support post-facto analysis in simulation research. In this submission, we show it working inside a multiplayer driving simulator. Rerun is built in Unity 3D and captures the virtual behavior of participants and their interactions with virtual objects. These recorded behaviors can then be played back from any perspective in the virtual space. This is useful in multi-agent interaction studies because researchers can sift through scenarios carefully from each participant’s perspective or even from an outside observer’s perspective. This enables a fine-grained understanding of implicit and explicit signaling between participants and other human or AI-controlled agents.

 Demonstrating the Potential of Interactive Product Packaging for Enriching Human-Robot Interaction   
 Christine P. Lee 
  Bengisu Cagiltay 
  Dakota Sullivan 
  Bilge Mutlu 
  While social robots are increasingly introduced into domestic settings, few have explored the utility of the robots’ packaging. Here we highlight the potential of product packaging in human-robot interaction to facilitate, expand, and enrich user experience with the robot. We present a social robot’s box as interactive product packaging, designed to be reused as a “home” for the robot. Through co-design sessions with children an narrative-driven and socially engaging box was developed to support initial interactions between the child and the robot. Our findings emphasize the importance of packaging design to produce positive outcomes towards successful human-robot interaction.  

 SEAN-VR: An Immersive Virtual Reality Experience for Evaluating Social Robot Navigation   
 Qiping Zhang 
  Nathan Tsoi 
  Marynel Vázquez 
  We propose a demonstration of the Social Environment for Autonomous Navigation with Virtual Reality (VR) for advancing research in Human-Robot Interaction. In our demonstration, a user controls a virtual avatar in simulation and performs directed navigation tasks with a mobile robot in a warehouse environment. Our demonstration shows how researchers can leverage the immersive nature of VR to study robot navigation from a user-centered perspective in densely populated environments while avoiding physical safety concerns common with operating robots in the real world. This is important for studying interactions with robots driven by algorithms that are early in their development lifecycle.  

 Language Models for Human-Robot Interaction   
 Erik Billing 
  Julia Rosén 
  Maurice Lamb 
  Recent advances in large scale language models have significantly changed the landscape of automatic dialogue systems and chatbots. We believe that these models also have a great potential for changing the way we interact with robots. Here, we present the first integration of the OpenAI GPT-3 language model for the Aldebaran Pepper and Nao robots. The present work transforms the text-based API of GPT-3 into an open verbal dialogue with the robots. The system will be presented live during the HRI2023 conference and the source code of this integration is shared with the hope that it will serve the community in designing and evaluating new dialogue systems for robots.

  We demonstrate how state-of-art open-source tools for automatic speech recognition (vosk) and dialogue management (rasa) can be integrated on a social robotic platform (PAL Robotics’ ARI robot) to provide rich verbal interactions.  
 Our open-source, ROS-based pipeline implements the ROS4HRI standard, and the demonstration specifically presents the details of the integration, in a way that will enable attendees to replicate it on their robots.  
 The demonstration takes place in the context of assistive robotics and robots for elderly care, two application domains with unique interaction challenges, for which, the ARI robot has been designed and extensively tested in real-world settings.  

 I’m a Robot Hear Me Speak!   
 Emma Hughson 
  Paige Tuttösí 
  Akihiro Matsufuji 
  Chuxuan Zhang 
  Angelica Lim 
  How should a robot speak in warm, cold, loud or bright environments? We propose a demonstration that allows participants to experience how varied background ambient contexts (i.e., lighting, sound, background) can affect the acceptability of robot voice styles, including pitch range, speed, and pauses. We demonstrate the technical result of a 3-step voice design process: (a) Collecting human voice data under the varied ambient conditions, (b) Clustering human vocal utterances to identify primary voice styles, and (c) Modifying a robot voice to the clustered voice styles. The demo will allow participants to experience a food service scenario in 6 different ambient conditions, and feel how changing the robot’s voice style can affect both intelligibility and social appropriateness. Ultimately, we hope to highlight the importance in adapting a robot’s vocal characteristics to ambient contexts, towards deploying robots in the wild.

  Randy Gomez 
  Sarah Rose Siskind 
  Current robot dialog systems are predominantly implemented using a sequential, utterance based, two-party speak-wait/speak-wait approach. This is inadequate for any interaction where rapid timed turn-taking is required. In this demo we show how a conversational listener can support a comedy dialogue with the social robot ‘Haru’. The system depends on fast local word-spotting and can be extended to support scripted and semi-scripted interactions where conversational timing is important such as fictive dialogues for educational purposes, or to support acting within a story telling context. The system could also be integrated with a full dialogue manager for non-scripted open dialogue applications.

  Naomi T. Fitter 
  A well-designed and evaluated study plays an essential role in highlighting the impact and contribution of a research idea. However, novice Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) researchers often lack the experience and know-how to devise an effective study. This workshop aims to provide a platform for those doing research in HRI, and related fields to obtain expert feedback on their study design before running a user study. The workshop invites a 2-4 page long contribution from participants outlining an upcoming user study focusing on the methods section and planned analyses. Participants will take part in two separate mentoring sessions led by different mentors. The workshop is interactive in nature and will also include mentor-led discussion sessions on topics relevant to study design such as hypothesis design and analysis, and human-centered study design.  

 The Imperfectly Relatable Robot: An Interdisciplinary Workshop on the Role of Failure in HRI

  Kavyaa Somasundaram 
  Sanne van Waveren 
  Ana Paiva 
  Amy Loutfi 
  Focusing on failure to improve human-robot interactions represents a novel approach that calls into question human expectations of robots, as well as posing ethical and methodological challenges to researchers. Fictional representations of robots (still for many non-expert users the primary source of expectations and assumptions about robots) often emphasize the ways in which robots surpass/perfect humans, rather than portraying them as fallible. Thus, to encounter robots that come too close, drop items or stop suddenly starts to close the gap between fiction and reality. These kinds of failures – if mitigated by explanation or recovery procedures – have the potential to make the robot a little more relatable and human-like. However studying failures in human-robot interaction requires producing potentially difficult or uncomfortable interactions in which robots failing to behave as expected may seem counterintuitive and unethical. In this space, interdisciplinary conversations are the key to untangling the multiple challenges and bringing themes of power and context into view. In this workshop, we invite researchers from across the disciplines to an interactive, interdisciplinary discussion around failure in social robotics. Topics for discussion include (but are not limited to) methodological and ethical challenges around studying failure in HRI, epistemological gaps in defining and understanding failure in HRI, sociocultural expectations around failure and users’ responses.

  Nowadays, robots are expected to interact more physically, cognitively, and socially with people. They should adapt to unpredictable contexts alongside individuals with various behaviours. For this reason personalisation is a valuable attribute for social robots as it allows them to act according to a specific user’s needs and preferences and achieve natural and transparent robot behaviours for humans. If correctly implemented, personalisation could also be the key to the large-scale adoption of social robotics. However achieving personalisation is arduous as it requires us to expand the boundaries of robotics by taking advantage of the expertise of various domains. Indeed, personalised robots need to analyse and model user interactions while considering their involvement in the adaptative process. It also requires us to address ethical and socio-cultural aspects of personalised HRI to achieve inclusive and diverse interaction and avoid deception and misplaced trust when interacting with the users. At the same time, policymakers need to ensure regulations in view of possible short-term and long-term adaptive HRI. This workshop aims to raise an interdisciplinary discussion on personalisation in robotics. It aims at bringing researchers from different fields together to propose guidelines for personalisation while addressing the following questions: how to define it – how to achieve it – and how it should be guided to fit legal and ethical requirements.

  Conversation is one of the primary methods of interaction between humans and robots. It provides a natural way of communication with the robot, thereby reducing the obstacles that can be faced through other interfaces (e.g., text or touch) that may cause difficulties to certain populations, such as the elderly or those with disabilities, promoting inclusivity in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Work in HRI has contributed significantly to the design, understanding and evaluation of human-robot conversational interactions. Concurrently, the Conversational User Interfaces (CUI) community has developed with similar aims, though with a wider focus on conversational interactions across a range of devices and platforms. This workshop aims to bring together the CUI and HRI communities through a one-day workshop to outline key shared opportunities and challenges in developing conversational interactions with robots, resulting in collaborative publications targeted at the CUI 2023 provocations track.

Yet, suggestions and recommendations tailored to child-robot-interaction (CRI) research, which poses it’s own additional set of challenges, remain limited. There is also an increased need within both HRI and CRI for inter and cross-disciplinary collaborations, where input from multiple different domains can contribute to better research outcomes. Consequently, this workshop aims to facilitate discussions between researchers from diverse disciplines within CRI. The workshop will open with a panel discussion between CRI researchers from different disciplines, followed by 3-minute flash talks of the accepted submissions. The second half of the workshop will consist of breakout group discussions, where both senior and junior academics from different disciplines can share their experiences of conducting CRI research. Through this workshop we hope to create a common ground for addressing shared challenges in CRI, as well as identify a set of possible solutions going forward.  

 Lifelong Learning and Personalization in Long-Term Human-Robot Interaction (LEAP-HRI): Adaptivity for All

  Adaptation and personalization are critical elements when modeling robot behaviors toward users in real-world settings. Multiple aspects of the user need to be taken into consideration in order to personalize the interaction, such as their personality, emotional state, intentions, and actions. While this information can be obtained a priori through self-assessment questionnaires or in real-time during the interaction through user profiling, behaviors and preferences can evolve in long-term interactions. Thus, gradually learning new concepts or skills (i.e., “lifelong learning”) both for the users and the environment is crucial to adapt to new situations and personalize interactions with the aim of maintaining their interest and engagement. In addition, adapting to individual differences autonomously through lifelong learning allows for inclusive interactions with all users with varying capabilities and backgrounds. The third edition of the “Lifelong Learning and Personalization in Long-Term Human-Robot Interaction (LEAP-HRI)” workshop aims to gather and present interdisciplinary insights from a variety of fields, such as education, rehabilitation, elderly care service and companion robots, for lifelong robot learning and adaptation to users, context, environment, and activities in long-term interactions. The workshop aims to promote a common ground among the relevant scientific communities through invited talks and in-depth discussions via paper presentations, break-out groups, and a scientific debate. In line with the HRI 2023 conference theme, “HRI for all”, our workshop theme is “adaptivity for all” to encourage HRI theories, methods, designs, and studies for lifelong learning personalization, and adaptation that aims to promote inclusion and diversity in HRI.  

 Variable Autonomy for Human-Robot Teaming (VAT)

  As robots are introduced to various domains and applications, Human-Robot Teaming (HRT) capabilities are essential. Such capabilities involve teaming with humans in\ on\ out-the-loop at different levels of abstraction, leveraging the complementing capabilities of humans and robots. This requires robotic systems with the ability to dynamically vary their level or degree of autonomy to collaborate with the human(s) efficiently and overcome various challenging circumstances. Variable Autonomy (VA) is an umbrella term encompassing such research, including but not limited to shared control and shared autonomy, mixed-initiative adjustable autonomy, and sliding autonomy.  
 This workshop is driven by the timely need to bring together VA-related research and practices that are often disconnected across different communities as the field is relatively young. The workshop’s goal is to consolidate research in VA. To this end, and given the complexity and span of Human-Robot systems, this workshop will adopt a holistic trans-disciplinary approach aiming to a) identify and classify related common challenges and opportunities; b) identify the disciplines that need to come together to tackle the challenges; c) identify and define common terminology, approaches, methodologies, benchmarks, and metrics; d) define short- and long-term research goals for the community.  
 To achieve these objectives, this workshop aims to bring together industry stakeholders, researchers from fields under the banner of VA, and specialists from other highly related fields such as human factors and psychology. The workshop will consist of a mix of invited talks, contributed papers, and an interactive discussion panel, toward a shared vision for VA.

  This year’s conference theme “HRI for all” not just raises the importance of reflecting on how to promote inclusion for every type of user but also calls for careful consideration of the different layers of people potentially impacted by such systems. In educational setups, for instance, the users to be considered first and foremost are the learners. However, teachers, school directors, therapists and parents also form a more secondary layer of users in this ecosystem. The 7th edition of R4L focuses on the issues that HRI experiments in educational environments may cause to stakeholders and how we could improve on bringing the stakeholders’ point of view into the loop. This goal is expected to be achieved in a very practical and dynamic way by the means of: (i) lightening talks from the participants; (ii) two discussion panels with special guests: One with active researchers from academia and industry about their experience and point of view regarding the inclusion of stakeholders; another panel with teacher, school directors, and parents that are/were involved in HRI experiments and will share their viewpoint; (iii) semi-structured group discussions and hands-on activities with participants and panellists to evaluate and propose guidelines for good practices regarding how to promote the inclusion of stakeholders, especially teachers, in educational HRI activities. By acquiring the viewpoint from the experimenters and stakeholders and analysing them in the same workshop, we expect to identify current gaps, propose practical solutions to bridge these gaps, and capitalise on existing synergies with the collective intelligence of the two communities.

  The 6th International Workshop on Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality for Human-Robot Interaction (VAM-HRI) will bring together HRI, robotics, and mixed reality researchers to address challenges in mixed reality interactions between humans and robots. Topics relevant to the workshop include the development of robots that can interact with humans in mixed reality, the use of virtual reality for developing interactive robots, the design of augmented reality interfaces that mediate communication between humans and robots, the investigations of mixed reality interfaces for robot learning, comparisons of the capabilities and perceptions of robots and virtual agents, and best design practices. VAM-HRI 2023 will follow the success of VAM-HRI 2018-22 and advance the cause of this nascent research community.  

 Semantic Scene Understanding for Human-Robot Interaction

  Service robots will be co-located with human users in an unstructured human-centered environment and will benefit from understanding the user’s daily activities, preferences, and needs towards fully assisting them. This workshop aims to explore how abstract semantic knowledge of the user’s environment can be used as a context in understanding and grounding information regarding the user’s instructions, preferences, habits, and needs. While object semantics have primarily been investigated for robotics in the perception and manipulation domain, recent works have shown the benefits of semantic modeling in a Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) context toward understanding and assisting human users. This workshop focuses on semantic information that can be useful in generalizing and interpreting user instructions, modeling user activities, anticipating user needs and making the internal reasoning processes of a robot more interpretable to a user. Therefore, the workshop builds on topics from prior workshops such as Learning in HRI, behavior adaptation for assistance, and learning from humans and aims at facilitating cross-pollination across these domains through a common thread of utilizing abstract semantics of the physical world towards robot autonomy in assistive applications. We envision the workshop to touch on research areas such as unobtrusive learning from observations, preference learning, continual learning, enhancing the transparency of autonomous robot behavior, and user adaptation. The workshop aims to gather researchers working on these areas and provide fruitful discussions towards autonomous assistive robots that can learn and ground scene semantics for enhancing HRI.

  As robots become more ubiquitous in our modern world, the expectation that humans and robots will interact physically, conceptually, and emotionally in everyday life necessitates the development of validated technologies that are safe, secure, and effective. Regardless, robotics is still considered by many as being inaccessible, even as their availability increases. In alignment with the 2023 HRI Conference’s theme of ?HRI for all,” this fifth installment of the Workshop on Test Methods and Metrics for Effective HRI is focused on addressing this accessibility disparity. Specifically, this year’s workshop presents and addresses issues regarding 1) human factors for diverse populations, 2) accessibility of standards and specifications, and 3) enabling equal and equitable access to research results & data. The goal of this workshop is to enable increased accessibility to HRI research and resources by addressing the metrology that is used to verify and validate HRI performance.

  With robots poised to enter our daily environments, they will not only need to work for people, but also learn from them. An active area of investigation in the robotics, machine learning, and human-robot interaction communities is the design of teachable robots that can learn interactively from human input. To refer to these research efforts, we use the umbrella term Human-Interactive Robot Learning (HIRL). While algorithmic solutions for robots learning from people have been investigated in a variety of ways, HIRL, as a fairly new research area, is still lacking: 1) a formal set of definitions to classify related but distinct research problems or solutions, 2) benchmark tasks, interactions, and metrics to evaluate the performance of HIRL algorithms and interactions, and 3) clear long-term research challenges to be addressed by different communities. Last year we began consolidating the needed definitions and vocabulary to enable fruitful discussions between researchers from these interdisciplinary fields, and identified a preliminary list of long, medium, and short-term research problems for the community to tackle, and existing tools and frameworks that can be leveraged to this end. This workshop will build upon these discussions, focusing on promoting the specification and design of HIRL benchmarks.  

 Advancing Human-Robot Interaction Research and Benchmarking Through Open-Source Ecosystems   
 Adam Norton

  Recent rapid progress in HRI research makes it more crucial than ever to have systematic development and benchmarking methodologies to assess and compare different algorithms and strategies. Indeed, the lack of such methodologies results in inefficiencies and sometimes stagnation, since new methods cannot be effectively compared to prior work and the research gaps become challenging to identify. Moreover, lacking an active and effective mechanism to disseminate and utilize the available datasets and benchmarking protocols significantly reduces their impact and utility. A unified effort in the development, utilization, and dissemination of open-source assets amongst a governed community of users can advance these domains substantially; for HRI this is particularly needed in the curation and generation of datasets for benchmarking. This workshop will take a step towards removing the roadblocks to the development and assessment of HRI by reviewing, discussing and laying the groundwork for an open-source ecosystem at the intersection of HRI and robot manipulation. The workshop will play a crucial role for identifying the preconditions and requirements to develop an open-source ecosystem that provides open-source assets for HRI benchmarking and comparison, aiming to determine the needs and wants of HRI researchers. Invited speakers include those who have contributed to the development of open-source assets in HRI and robot manipulation and discussion topics will include issues related to the usage of open-source assets and the benefits of forming of an open-source ecosystem.

  Avatar robots can help people extend their physical, cognitive, and perceptual capabilities, allowing people to exceed time and space constraints. In that sense, avatar robots can greatly influence people’s lives. However, we have many challenges to be addressed in various scenarios such as avatar-human interaction operator-avatar interaction, avatar-avatar interaction, ethical and legal issues, technical challenges, and so on. It is indispensable to discuss what the necessary research and technologies are to realize avatars that are well accepted in society while envisioning a future symbiotic society in which people communicate with other people and their avatars. In our previous workshop “Symbiotic Society with Avatars: Social Acceptance Ethics, and Technologies (SSA)” we focused on the ethical aspect of avatars. In this workshop, our aim is to provide an opportunity for researchers from different backgrounds including social robotics, teleoperation and mixed reality to come together and discuss the advances and values in a symbiotic society with avatars.

  Diversity, equality, and inclusion (DEI) are critical factors that need to be considered when developing AI and robotic technologies for people. The lack of such considerations exacerbates and can also perpetuate existing forms of discrimination and biases in society for years to come. Although concerns have already been voiced around the globe, there is an urgent need to take action within the human-robot interaction (HRI) community. This workshop contributes to filling the gap by providing a platform in which to share experiences and research insights on identifying, addressing, and integrating DEI considerations in HRI. With respect to last year, this year the workshop will further engage participants on the problem of sampling biases through hands-on co-design activities for mitigating inequity and exclusion within the field of HRI.  

 Perspectives on Moral Agency in Human-Robot Interaction   
 Boyoung Kim

  Establishing when, how, and why robots should be considered moral agents is key for advancing human-robot interaction. For instance, whether a robot is considered a moral agent has significant implications for how researchers, designers, and users can, should, and do make sense of robots and whether their agency in turn triggers social and moral cognitive and behavioral processes in humans. Robotic moral agency also has significant implications for how people should and do hold robots morally accountable, ascribe blame to them develop trust in their actions, and determine when these robots wield moral influence. In this workshop on Perspectives on Moral Agency in Human-Robot Interaction, we plan to bring together participants who are interested in or have studied the topics concerning a robot’s moral agency and its impact on human behavior. We intend to provide a platform for holding interdisciplinary discussions about (1) which elements should be considered to determine the moral agency of a robot, (2) how these elements can be measured, (3) how they can be realized computationally and applied to the robotic system, and (4) what societal impact is anticipated when moral agency is assigned to a robot. We encourage participants from diverse research fields, such as computer science, psychology, cognitive science, and philosophy, as well as participants from social groups marginalized in terms of gender, ethnicity, and culture.

 We encourage the community to consider ways both to make the camp a more inclusive place for those who may not feel included, and to encourage inclusion in our research methods and practices.  
 There are many ways to participate in HRI 2023, including full documents, overdue reports, demos, videos, and workshops.  
 There are many opportunities to engage, particularly for students and those new to the field, including through volunteering and attending mentoring seminars.  
 The conference will take place March 13-16, 2023 in Stockholm, Sweden.  
 Our goal is for it to be a hybrid conference, with opportunities to attend both in person and online.  
 We will publish more details as the conference date approaches.

  SEC 2023 – Trustworthy Edge Computing Workshop  
  Organized in conjunction with ACM SEC 2023, Wilmington, DE, USA, Dec. 9th 2023  
   
  Edge computing has become a topic of significant interest in academic and industrial research, driven by the fundamental improvements in latency, bandwidth savings and energy efficiency it offers with respect to offloading application workloads. While many envisioned applications in edge computing are relevant in the context of real-time analytics and feedback, most of the research today approaches edge computing from a “best effort” perspective, focusing on expected/average system behavior.  

  Nevertheless, in order to make edge computing appealing for consumer applications, trustworthiness must be considered as a key design objective. Thus, depending on the application, systems must go beyond the provisioning of average system behavior assurances. In this way, trustworthiness directly relates to predictability, latency as well as availability/reliability. However, beyond such standard metrics for networked systems, security and safety of edge-based applications will also play an important role, while relating properties of the edge infrastructure and of the associated applications running on top of the infrastructure.  
  
  We solicit contributions towards trustworthy edge computing systems and applications, such as (but not limited to):   
 Theoretical and/or practical results targeting at predictability of edge computing systems with respect to computational and communication aspects 
  Models and algorithms to determine trustworthiness of edge computing systems and corresponding applications 
  Orchestration mechanisms to integrate edge and cloud computing resources 
  Security, privacy and safety mechanisms for assurance of edge computing systems 
  General theoretical and/or practical results on integrated communication and computation aspects of edge computing systems and applications 
  Volunteer edge computing with distributed resource brokering 
  Federated learning via edge systems in relation to safety, security and privacy 
  Trustworthy edge -assisted artificial intelligence 
  Application-oriented resource allocation and cross-layer optimization 
  Software engineering aspects towards trustworthy edge systems and applications 
  Consumer applications for trustworthy edge computing in residential, industry, or government sectors 
  Service level agreements, contracts or similar approaches for handling multiple users/tenants settings in heterogeneous mixed criticality applications 
  Social, economic and behavioral considerations for building sustainable edge computing systems and applications 
  AI for trustworthy systems 
  Distributed ledger technology (DLT) & blockchain for trustworthy edge computing

  Hosting Middleware 

 Welcome to the website of the MIDDLEWARE series of conferences!  
 The Middleware conference is a forum for the discussion of important innovations and recent advances in the design, construction and uses of middleware. Middleware is a distributed-system software that resides between applications and underlying platforms (operating systems; databases; hardware), and/or ties together distributed applications, databases or devices. Its primary role is to coordinate and enable communication between different layers or components while isolating much of the complexity of distribution into a single, well tested and well understood system abstraction.  
 The scope of the conference is the design, implementation, deployment, and evaluation of distributed system platforms and architectures for future computing and communication environments.  
 MIDDLEWARE 2024  will be held in Hong Kong, China.  
 MIDDLEWARE 2025  will be held in Nashville, TN, USA

  About ICPE  
 The International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE) originated 14 years ago from the fusion of an ACM workshop on software and performance prediction and a SPEC workshop focused on benchmarking and performance evaluation.  
 ICPE continues true to its origins with focus both on software performance modeling, prediction, and measurement as well as on benchmark-based performance evaluation. The areas to which such principles are applied have evolved over the years with the technological evolution in academia and industry.  
 ICPE contributions appear at all levels of system and software design, performance modeling, and measurements of performance, from the cloud’s core to edge, from mobile devices to major data centers, from web applications to scientific applications.  
 The ICPE focus on engineering performance means that industrial practitioners and academics that participate in ICPE are interested in quantifying the performance impact of all aspects of complex systems design and implementation. Length of design cycles, life-time maintenance issues, quality of experience, costs to delivering a system or service are also the focus of the intellectual curiosity of ICPE participants.  
 Notice  : ICPE 2023 will be held in person. Remote presentations and pre-recorded videos are not allowed unless all authors of an accepted paper are under special circumstances that prevent them from attending the conference in person. Requests for such exceptions will be considered carefully by the organizing committee.  
 If you have any question about ICPE, please contact us through the following e-mail: icpe2023@dei.uc.pt

 Proceedings of the 2023 ACM/SPEC International Conference  
 It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 14th annual ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE 2023) and to the cultural city of Coimbra - located in the center of Portugal, known as A cidade dos estudantes (the city of the students), and hosting the oldest University in Portugal and of Portuguese language, the University of Coimbra.  
 The International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE) originated 14 years ago from the fusion of the ACM Workshop on Software Performance (WOSP Est. 1998) and the SPEC International Performance Engineering Workshop (SIPEW Est. 2008). Since then, ICPE has been the leading international forum for presenting and discussing novel ideas, innovations, trends and experiences in the field of performance engineering.  
 Performance, energy efficiency and reliability are becoming central to the acceptance and sustainability of modern computing systems. However, they are also becoming more and more challenging to achieve. The computing systems are constantly growing in complexity and becoming more tightly integrated in human interaction, which makes their behavior more complex and therefore more difficult to engineer and understand. We need to be able to manage this complexity so that our systems remain reliable, trustable and performant.

 Pushing the Limits of Video Game Performance: A Performance Engineering Perspective   
 Mathieu Nayrolles 
  Ubisoft constantly pushes the boundaries of game development to create immersive worlds that capture the imagination of millions of players worldwide. To achieve this, performance engineering plays a crucial role in ensuring that games run smoothly on various platforms and devices.  
 In this talk, we will explore the latest advancements in the field of performance engineering for video games, focusing on runtime performance, network optimization, backend and database optimization, and cloud gaming. We will discuss how machine learning techniques enhance classical profiling and optimize game engine scheduling.  
 Additionally, we will address the challenges of deterministic replication of assets between clients and optimizing micro-services for cloud gaming experiences. Lastly, we will touch on the importance of performance engineering for non-code aspects of game development, such as animation, textures, props, and assets.  

 Automated Optimisation of Modern Software System Properties   
 Federica Sarro 
  Realizing modern software systems poses new challenges to the software engineers: Users of applications running on limited capability devices still demand acceptable performance [2, 5, 13, 15]; users of systems relying on artificial intelligence to take decision (rightly) reclaim a fair treatment [4 , 7, 12]; users of social networking systems expect to be protected against malicious behaviours [1]. Moreover, AI-enabled software systems are so energy-greedy that their usage is causing an alarming surge in energy consumption with a significant increase in CO2 emissions [10].  
 Equipping software with appealing functionalities and minimising faults, is not enough if the emerging non-functional properties of these systems, such as fairness, safety and sustainability, are not taken into account. Mobile users will stop using an app if it is too slow or uses much bandwidth [5 , 13]. Human bias can be transferred to various real-word systems relying on ML: Bias has been found in advertisement, recruitment, admission processes [3 , 9 , 19], among others, and human rights [16]. A growing number of malicious users use well-intentioned software platforms as a tool to attack the innocent users with whom they share the platform. Examples of such harmful acts are sadly too many to list; they include bullying, harassment, hate speech, misinformation, election interference, scamming and spamming. ChatGTP is an AI model able to answer a variety of questions, compose essays, have philosophical conversations, and even code or fix bugs [18]. However, all these come at a high cost: ChatGPT has been estimated to consume the equivalent of the electricity consumed by 175,000 people in Denmark per month.  
 In this keynote, I will discuss the necessity to take these properties into account when realizing these type of systems, and the extent to which it is possible to automate their optimization. I will discuss existing solutions mainly based, but not limited to, multi-objective optimisation [5, 6, 8, 10, 14 , 17]. In fact, we cannot expect that a software engineer, regardless of their level of expertise, would be able to manually find all opportunities for optimising these non-functional properties [11]. I will review research trends, presenting results from the SOLAR group and others. I will also discuss some directions for future work and open-challenges towards achieving better, fairer, safer and greener software.  

 Application Knowledge Required: Performance Modeling for Fun and Profit   
 Georg Hager 
  In High Performance Computing, resource efficiency is paramount. Expensive systems need to be utilized to the maximum of their capabilities, but deep insight into the bottlenecks of a particular hardware-software combination is often lacking on the users' side. Analytic, first-principles performance models can provide such insight. They are built on simplified descriptions of the machine, the software, and how they interact. This goes, to some extent, against the general trend towards automation in computer science; the individual conducting the analysis does require some knowledge of the application and the hardware in order to make performance engineering a scientific process instead of blindly generating data with tools that are poorly understood. This talk uses examples from parallel high-performance computing to demonstrate how analytic performance models can support scientific thinking in performance engineering: Sparse matrix-vector multiplication, the HPCG benchmark, the CloverLeaf proxy app, and a lattice-Boltzmann solver. Interestingly, the most intriguing insights emerge from the failure of analytic models to accurately predict performance measurements.

 Is Sharing Caring? Analyzing the Incentives for Shared Cloud Clusters   
 Talha Mehboob

  Many organizations maintain and operate large shared computing clusters, since they can substantially reduce computing costs by leveraging statistical multiplexing to amortize it across all users. Importantly, such shared clusters are generally not free to use, but have an internal pricing model that funds their operation. Since employees at many large organizations, especially Universities, have some budgetary autonomy over purchase decisions, internal shared clusters are increasingly competing for users with cloud platforms, which may offer lower costs and better performance. As a result, many organizations are shifting their shared clusters to operate on cloud resources. This paper empirically analyzes the user incentives for shared cloud clusters under two different pricing models using an 8-year job trace from a large shared cluster for a large University system.  
 Our analysis shows that, with either pricing model, a large fraction of users have little financial incentive to participate in a shared cloud cluster compared to directly acquiring resources from a cloud platform. While shared cloud clusters can provide some limited reductions in cost by leveraging reserved instances at a discount, due to bursty workloads, realizing these reductions generally requires imposing long job waiting times, which for many users are likely not worth the cost reduction. In particular, we show that, assuming users defect from the shared cluster if their wait time is greater than 15x their average job runtime, over 80% of the users would defect, which increases the price of the remaining users such that it eliminates any incentive to participate in a shared cluster. Thus, while shared cloud clusters may provide users other benefits, their financial incentives are weak.  

 Lightweight Kubernetes Distributions: A Performance Comparison of MicroK8s, k3s, k0s, and Microshift   
 Heiko Koziolek 
  Nafise Eskandani 
  With containers becoming a prevalent method of software deployment, there is an increasing interest to use container orchestration frameworks not only in data centers, but also on resource-constrained hardware, such as Internet-of-Things devices, Edge gateways, or developer workstations. Consequently, software vendors have released several lightweight Kubernetes (K8s) distributions for container orchestration in the last few years, but it remains difficult for software developers to select an appropriate solution. Existing studies on lightweight K8s distribution performance tested only small workloads, showed inconclusive results, and did not cover recently released distributions. The contribution of this paper is a comparison of MicroK8s, k3s, k0s, and MicroShift, investigating their minimal resource usage as well as control plane and data plane performance in stress scenarios. While k3s and k0s showed by a small amount the highest control plane throughput and MicroShift showed the highest data plane throughput, usability, security, and maintainability are additional factors that drive the decision for an appropriate distribution.  

 Autoscaler Evaluation and Configuration: A Practitioner's Guideline

  Samuel Kounev 
  Autoscalers are indispensable parts of modern cloud deployments and determine the service quality and cost of a cloud application in dynamic workloads. The configuration of an autoscaler strongly influences its performance and is also one of the biggest challenges and showstoppers for the practical applicability of many research autoscalers. Many proposed cloud experiment methodologies can only be partially applied in practice, and many autoscaling papers use custom evaluation methods and metrics. This paper presents a practical guideline for obtaining meaningful and interpretable results on autoscaler performance with reasonable overhead. We provide step-by-step instructions for defining realistic usage behaviors and traffic patterns. We divide the analysis of autoscaler performance into a qualitative antipattern-based analysis and a quantitative analysis. To demonstrate the applicability of our guideline, we conduct several experiments with a microservice of our industry partner in a realistic test environment.

  GPUs have become common in HPC systems to accelerate scientific computing and machine learning applications. Efficiently mapping these applications to rapid evolutions of GPU architectures for high performance is a well-known challenge. Various performance inefficiencies exist in GPU kernels that impede applications from obtaining bare-metal performance. While existing tools are able to measure these inefficiencies, they mostly focus on data collection and presentation, requiring significant manual efforts to understand the root causes for actionable optimization. Thus, we develop DrGPU, a novel profiler that performs top-down analysis to guide GPU code optimization. As its salient feature, DrGPU leverages hardware performance counters available in commodity GPUs to quantify stall cycles, decompose them into various stall reasons, pinpoint root causes, and provide intuitive optimization guidance. With the help of DrGPU, we are able to analyze important GPU benchmarks and applications and obtain nontrivial speedups --- up to 1.77X on V100 and 2.03X on GTX 1650.  

 Systematically Exploring High-Performance Representations of Vector Fields Through Compile-Time Composition

  Ana-Lucia Varbanescu 
  Andy Pimentel 
  Andreas Salzburger 
  Attila Krasznahorkay 
  We present a novel benchmark suite for implementations of vector fields in high-performance computing environments to aid developers in quantifying and ranking their performance. We decompose the design space of such benchmarks into access patterns and storage backends, the latter of which can be further decomposed into components with different functional and non-functional properties. Through compile-time meta-programming, we generate a large number of benchmarks with minimal effort and ensure the extensibility of our suite. Our empirical analysis, based on real-world applications in high-energy physics, demonstrates the feasibility of our approach on CPU and GPU platforms, and highlights that our suite is able to evaluate performance-critical design choices. Finally, we propose that our work towards composing vector fields from elementary components is not only useful for the purposes of benchmarking, but that it naturally gives rise to a novel library for implementing such fields in domain applications.  

 Evaluating the Energy Measurements of the IBM POWER9 On-Chip Controller   
 Hannes Tröpgen 
  Mario Bielert 
  Thomas Ilsche 
  Dependable power measurements are the backbone of energy-efficient computing systems. The IBM PowerNV platform offers such power measurements through an embedded PowerPC 405 processor: The On-Chip Controller (OCC). Among other system-control tasks, the OCC provides power measurements for several domains, such as system, CPU, and GPU. This paper provides a detailed description and an in-depth evaluation of these OCC-provided power measurements. For that, we describe the provided interfaces themselves and experimentally verify their overhead (3.6 µs to 10.8 µs per access) and readout rate (24.95 Sa/s). We also study the consistency of the reported sensor readouts across the measurement domains and compare it to externally measured data. Furthermore, we estimate the internal sampling rate (1996 Sa/s) by provoking aliasing errors with artificial workloads, and quantify the errors that such aliasing could introduce in practice (for power consumption of processors 12% in our experimental worst-case scenario). Given these insights, practitioners using the IBM PowerNV platform can assess the quality of the embedded measurements, permitting sought-after energy efficiency improvements.

 Predicting the Performance of ATL Model Transformations

  Model transformation languages are special-purpose languages, which are designed to define transformations as comfortably as possible, i.e., often in a declarative way. Typically, developers create their transformations based on small input models which systematically cover the language of the input models. This makes it difficult for the developers to estimate how the transformations would perform for a large and diverse set of input models.  
 Hence, developers would benefit from an approach for predicting the performance of model transformations based on just abstract characteristics of input models. Regression approaches based on machine learning lend themselves well to such predictions. However, it is currently unknown, whether and which regression approach is suitable in this context as well as how a model should be abstractly characterized for this purpose.  
 We conducted several experiments to analyze how well different machine learning methods predict the execution time of model transformations defined in the Atlas Transformation Language (ATL) transformations for distinct sets of model characteristics. As possible methods, we have investigated linear regression, random forests and support vector regression using a radial basis function kernel.  
 The results of our experiments show that support vector regression is the best choice in terms of usability and prediction accuracy for the model transformation modules covered in our experiments and is thus suited for a prediction approach. In addition, simple model characterizations based only on the number of model elements, the number of references, and the number of attributes are a suitable way to easily describe a model and to achieve decent prediction accuracy.  

 Predicting the Performance of a Computing System with Deep Networks   
 Mehmet Cengiz

  Andrew Stephen McGough 
  Predicting the performance and energy consumption of computing hardware is critical for many modern applications. This will inform procurement decisions, deployment decisions, and autonomic scaling. Existing approaches to understanding the performance of hardware largely focus around benchmarking -- leveraging standardised workloads which seek to be representative of an end-user's needs. Two key challenges are present; benchmark workloads may not be representative of an end-user's workload, and benchmark scores are not easily obtained for all hardware. Within this paper, we demonstrate the potential to build Deep Learning models to predict benchmark scores for unseen hardware. We undertake our evaluation with the openly available SPEC 2017 benchmark results. We evaluate three different networks, one fully-connected network along with two Convolutional Neural Networks (one bespoke and one ResNet inspired) and demonstrate impressive R2 scores of 0.96, 0.98 and 0.94 respectively.  

 Predicting Inference Latency of Neural Architectures on Mobile Devices   
 Zhuojin Li 
  Marco Paolieri 
  Leana Golubchik 
  Due to the proliferation of inference tasks on mobile devices, state-of-the-art neural architectures are typically designed using Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to achieve good tradeoffs between machine learning accuracy and inference latency. While measuring inference latency of a huge set of candidate architectures during NAS is not feasible, latency prediction for mobile devices is challenging, because of hardware heterogeneity, optimizations applied by machine learning frameworks, and diversity of neural architectures. Motivated by these challenges, we first quantitatively assess the characteristics of neural architectures and mobile devices that have significant effects on inference latency. Based on this assessment, we propose an operation-wise framework which addresses these challenges by developing operation-wise latency predictors and achieves high accuracy in end-to-end latency predictions, as shown by our comprehensive evaluations on multiple mobile devices using multicore CPUs and GPUs. To illustrate that our approach does not require expensive data collection, we also show that accurate predictions can be achieved on real-world neural architectures using only small amounts of profiling data.  

 A Method to Evaluate the Performance of Predictors in Cyber-Physical Systems   
 Leonardo Passig Horstmann 
  Matheus Wagner 
  Antônio Augusto Fröhlich 
  Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) rely on sensing to control and optimize their operation. Nevertheless, sensing itself is prone to errors that can originate at several stages, from sampling to communication. In this context, several systems adopt multivariate predictors to assess the quality of the sensed data, to replace data from faulty sensors, or to derive variables that cannot be directly sensed. These predictors are often evaluated based on their accuracy and computing demands, however, such evaluations often do not consider the system's architecture from a broader perspective, ignoring the way components are interconnected and how they cascade as inputs of other Machine Learning (ML) models. In this work, we introduce a method to evaluate the performance of interdependent predictors based on the stability of the estimation error dynamics in faulty scenarios. The proposed method estimates the ability of a predictor to produce accurate predictions while accounting for the impacts of cascading predicted values as its inputs. The prediction correctness is estimated based solely on information acquired during the training of the multivariate predictors and mathematical properties of the ML activation functions. The proposed method is evaluated with a meaningful dataset in the scope of monitoring and control of a Cyber-Physical System, and the evaluation demonstrates the ability of the proposed method to account for the interdependence of data predictors.  

 SESSION: Virtualization and Services  
 Analyzing the Performance of SD-WAN Enabled Service Function Chains Across the Globe with AWS   
 Aris Leivadeas 
  Nikolai Pitaev 
  Matthias Falkner 
  Cloud Computing has revolutionized the information technology world and the application offering over the last two decades. At the same time recent trends in Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Wide Area Networks (SD-WAN) and the combination of those with the Cloud paradigm has allowed an unprecedented shift of enterprise networking services towards the Public Cloud. Even though this network evolutionary approach brings many benefits, it still presents many drawbacks as well. The performance stability and service continuity over a black box Public Cloud infrastructure can hinder the formal service guarantees that many new emerging applications may have. To this end, in this paper, we aim to shed light on the overall performance achieved when deploying coast-to-coast and intercontinental Service Function Chains (SFCs) that interconnect geographically distributed enterprise branches over the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. In particular, we investigate the impact of region, Virtual Machine (VM) instance, time of the day and day of the week in the overall throughput and delay attained. The obtained results show the strengths and weaknesses of entirely relying on the AWS infrastructure to offer networking services by investigating possible hidden performance bottlenecks.

  HHVM is commonly developed for large online web services, yet there remains much room for optimizing HHVM performance. This paper discusses challenges and techniques in optimizing HHVM performance for Meta's web service. We begin by evaluating the effectiveness of semantic request routing, a request routing method aimed at enhancing code cache performance in HHVM, and examine its implications for optimizing HHVM performance. Second, we characterize HHVM performance for a large-scale datacenter and identify the challenges brought by uncontrollable confounding factors. Finally, we present the performance management framework for autotuning HHVM performance at scale.  

 A Methodology and Framework to Determine the Isolation Capabilities of Virtualisation Technologies

  The capability to isolate system resources is an essential characteristic of virtualisation technologies and is therefore important for research and industry alike. It allows the co-location of experiments and workloads, the partitioning of system resources and enables multi-tenant business models such as cloud computing. Poor isolation among tenants bears the risk of noisy-neighbour and contention effects which negatively impacts all of those use-cases. These effects describe the negative impact of one tenant onto another by utilising shared resources. Both industry and research provide many different concepts and technologies to realise isolation. Yet, the isolation capabilities of all these different approaches are not well understood; nor is there an established way to measure the quality of their isolation capabilities. Such an understanding, however, is of uttermost importance in practice to elaborately decide on a suited implementation. Hence, in this work, we present a novel methodology to measure the isolation capabilities of virtualisation technologies for system resources, that fulfils all requirements to benchmarking including reliability. It relies on an immutable approach, based on Experiment-as-Code. The complete process holistically includes everything from bare metal resource provisioning to the actual experiment enactment.  
 The results determined by this methodology help in the decision for a virtualisation technology regarding its capability to isolate given resources. Such results are presented here as a closing example in order to validate the proposed methodology.

  Computer architectures have evolved from single core to chips with thousands of cores. Loop and instruction level parallelism techniques like software pipelining that are successful for single cores have limitations in the multi-core era. We extend the software pipelining technology beyond the limits of fine-grained, instruction-level parallelism. We accomplish this through dataflow software pipelining technology and its extension. Specifically, we present extensions to dataflow-based codelet model and its abstract machine to exploit pipelined parallelism across loops.  
 We extend the runtime implementation of the codelet model with our proposed extensions to take advantage of dataflow software pipelining principles using efficient single-owner fifo buffer across Codelet's dependencies. We show promising improvements with the use of dataflow software pipelining techniques by performing an in-depth case study of Cannon's algorithm for matrix multiplication.  

 Meterstick: Benchmarking Performance Variability in Cloud and Self-hosted Minecraft-like Games   
 Jerrit Eickhoff 
  Jesse Donkervliet 
  Alexandru Iosup 
  Due to increasing popularity and strict performance requirements, online games have become a workload of interest for the performance engineering community. One of the most popular types of online games is the Minecraft-like Game (MLG), in which players can terraform the environment. The most popular MLG, Minecraft, provides not only entertainment, but also educational support and social interaction, to over 130 million people world-wide. MLGs currently support their many players by replicating isolated instances that support each only up to a few hundred players under favorable conditions. In practice, as we show here, the real upper limit of supported players can be much lower. In this work, we posit that performance variability is a key cause for the lack of scalability in MLGs, investigate experimentally causes of performance variability, and derive actionable insights. We propose a novel operational model for MLGs and use it to design the first benchmark that focuses on MLG performance variability, defining specialized workloads, metrics, and processes. We conduct real-world benchmarking of MLGs, both cloud-based and self-hosted, and find environment-based workloads and cloud deployment to be significant sources of performance variability: peak-latency degrades sharply to 20.7 times the arithmetic mean, and exceeds by a factor of 7.4 the performance requirements. We derive actionable insights for game-developers, game-operators, and other stakeholders to tame performance variability.  

 A Systematic Approach for Benchmarking of Container Orchestration Frameworks   
 Martin Straesser

  Samuel Kounev 
  Container orchestration frameworks play a critical role in modern cloud computing paradigms such as cloud-native or serverless computing. They significantly impact the quality and cost of service deployment as they manage many performance-critical tasks such as container provisioning, scheduling, scaling, and networking. Consequently, a comprehensive performance assessment of container orchestration frameworks is essential. However, until now, there is no benchmarking approach that covers the many different tasks implemented in such platforms and supports evaluating different technology stacks. In this paper, we present a systematic approach that enables benchmarking of container orchestrators. Based on a definition of container orchestration, we define the core requirements and benchmarking scope for such platforms. Each requirement is then linked to metrics and measurement methods, and a benchmark architecture is proposed. With COFFEE, we introduce a benchmarking tool supporting the definition of complex test campaigns for container orchestration frameworks. We demonstrate the potential of our approach with case studies of the frameworks Kubernetes and Nomad in a self-hosted environment and on the Google Cloud Platform. The presented case studies focus on container startup times, crash recovery, rolling updates, and more.

  Change point detection has recently gained popularity as a method of detecting performance changes in software due to its ability to cope with noisy data. In this paper we present Hunter, an open source tool that automatically detects performance regressions and improvements in time-series data. Hunter uses a modified E-divisive means algorithm to identify statistically significant changes in normally-distributed performance metrics. We describe the changes we made to the E-divisive means algorithm along with their motivation. The main change we adopted was to replace the significance test using randomized permutations with a Student's t-test, as we discovered that the randomized approach did not produce deterministic results, at least not with a reasonable number of iterations. In addition we've made tweaks that allow us to find change points the original algorithm would not, such as two nearby changes. For evaluation, we developed a method to generate real timeseries, but with artificially injected changes in latency. We used these data sets to compare Hunter against two other well known algorithms, PELT and DYNP. Finally, we conclude with lessons we've learned supporting Hunter across teams with individual responsibility for the performance of their project.

 The Performance of Distributed Applications: A Traffic Shaping Perspective   
 Jasper A. Hasenoot 
  Jan S. Rellermeyer 
  Alexandru Uta 
  Widely used in datacenters and clouds, network traffic shaping is a performance influencing factor that is often overlooked when benchmarking or simply deploying distributed applications. While in theory traffic shaping should allow for a fairer sharing of network resources, in practice it also introduces new problems: performance (measurement) inconsistency and long tails. In this paper we investigate the effects of traffic shaping mechanisms on common distributed applications. We characterize the performance of a distributed key-value store, big data workloads, and high-performance computing under state-of-the-art benchmarks, while the underlying network's traffic is shaped using state-of-the-art mechanisms such as token-buckets or priority queues. Our results show that the impact of traffic shaping needs to be taken into account when benchmarking or deploying distributed applications. To help researchers, practitioners, and application developers we uncover several practical implications and make recommendations on how certain applications are to be deployed so that performance is least impacted by the shaping protocols.  

 Packet-Level Analysis of Zoom Performance Anomalies

  In this paper, we use Wireshark packet-level traces to study the performance of the Zoom network application. Our work is motivated by several anecdotal reports of Zoom performance problems on our campus network during the Fall 2021 semester. Through the collection and analysis of Wireshark traces from different vantage points, we are able to pinpoint the root cause of the Zoom performance problems, which is a congested external Internet link for our campus network. We also identify several characteristics of the Zoom application that exacerbate its performance issues on congested and lossy networks, due to multi-layer protocol interactions.

 Incremental Change Detection Method For Data Center Power Efficiency Metrics (Work In Progress Paper)   
 Jana Backhus 
  Yasutaka Kono 
  We propose an incremental change detection method for data center (DC) energy efficiency metrics and consider its application to the power usage efficiency (PUE) metric. In recent years, there is an increasing focus on the sustainability of DCs and PUE is playing an important role to evaluate the DC's energy efficiency. Publicly reported PUE values are mostly calculated over a whole year as there are many fluctuations caused by outside influences as outdoor air temperature (OAT). In this paper, we propose a method to detect short-term changes in the DC energy efficiency (e.g., PUE) , while considering outside influences (e.g., OAT) observing related daily aggregated DC data. We also conduct a few preliminary experiments for PUE change detection based on real-world DC data, where we have manually labeled changes in the PUE using visualization tools. The experimental results show that the method can detect important major and minor changes in the PUE with a very low false positive rate. However, due to the small number of positive labels, the recall rate is currently between 57% and 70%. Further investigation is necessary to see how representative the current recall rates are and what kind of improvements are necessary to make the change detection method more stable.  

 Design-time Performability Evaluation of Runtime Adaptation Strategies (Work In Progress Paper)   
 Martina Rapp 
  Max Scheerer 
  Ralf Reussner 
  Performability is the classic metric for performance evaluation of static systems in case of failures. Compared to static systems, Self-Adaptive Systems (SASs) are inherently more complex due to their constantly changing nature. Thus software architects are facing more complex design decisions which are preferably evaluated at design-time. Model-Based Quality Analysis (MBQA) provides valuable support by putting software architects in a position to take well-founded design decisions about software system quality attributes over the whole development phase of a system. We claim that combining methods from MBQA and established performability concepts support software architects in this decision making process to design effective fault-tolerant adaptation strategies. Our contribution is a model-based approach to evaluate performability-oriented adaptation strategies of SAS at design-time. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by a proof-of-concept.  

 Event-based Simulation for Transient Systems with Capture Replay to Predict Self-Adaptive Systems (Work in Progress Paper)   
 Sarah Stieß 
  Stefan Höppner 
  Steffen Becker 
  Matthias Tichy 
  Cloud-native systems are dynamic in nature as they always have to react to changes in the environment, e.g., how users utilize the system. Self-adaptive cloud-native systems manage those changes by predicting how future environmental changes will impact the system's service level objectives and how the system can subsequently reconfigure to ensure that the service level objectives stay fulfilled. The farther the predictions look into the future, the higher the chance that good reconfigurations can be identified and applied. However, this requires efficient exploration of potential future system states, particularly exploring alternative futures resulting from alternative system reconfiguration. We present in this paper an extension to the Slingshot simulator for Palladio component models to efficiently explore the future state space induced by environmental changes and reconfigurations. The extension creates snapshots of simulation states and reloads them to explore alternatives. We show that Slingshot's event-based publish-subscribe architecture enables us to extend the simulator easily and without changes to the simulator itself.  

 Transparent Trace Annotation for Performance Debugging in Microservice-oriented Systems (Work In Progress Paper)   
 Adel Belkhiri 
  Ahmad Shahnejat Bushehri 
  Felipe Gohring de Magalhaes 
  Gabriela Nicolescu 
  Microservices is a cloud-native architecture in which a single application is implemented as a collection of small, independent, and loosely-coupled services. This architecture is gaining popularity in the industry as it promises to make applications more scalable and easier to develop and deploy. Nonetheless, adopting this architecture in practice has raised many concerns, particularly regarding the difficulty of diagnosing performance bugs and explaining abnormal software behaviour. Fortunately, many tools based on distributed tracing were proposed to achieve observability in microservice-oriented systems and address these concerns (e.g., Jaeger). Distributed tracing is a method for tracking user requests as they flow between services. While these tools can identify slow services and detect latency-related problems, they mostly fail to pinpoint the root causes of these issues.  
 This paper presents a new approach for enacting cross-layer tracing of microservice-based applications. It also proposes a framework for annotating traces generated by most distributed tracing tools with relevant tracing data and metrics collected from the kernel. The information added to the traces aims at helping the practitioner get a clear insight into the operations of the application executing user requests. The framework we present is notably efficient in diagnosing the causes of long tail latencies. Unlike other solutions, our approach for annotating traces is completely transparent as it does not require the modification of the application, the tracer, or the operating system. Furthermore, our evaluation shows that this approach incurs low overhead costs.  

 Visualizing Runtime Evolution Paths in a Multidimensional Space (Work In Progress Paper)   
 Hagen Tarner 
  Fabian Beck 
  Runtime data of software systems is often of multivariate nature, describing different aspects of performance among other characteristics, and evolves along different versions or changes depending on the execution context. This poses a challenge for visualizations, which are typically only two- or three-dimensional. Using dimensionality reduction, we project the multivariate runtime data to 2D and visualize the result in a scatter plot. To show changes over time, we apply the projection to multiple timestamps and connect temporally adjacent points to form trajectories. This allows for cluster and outlier detection, analysis of co-evolution, and finding temporal patterns. While projected temporal trajectories have been applied to other domains before, we use it to visualize software evolution and execution context changes as evolution paths. We experiment with and report results of two application examples: (I) the runtime evolution along different versions of components from the Apache Commons project, and (II) a benchmark suite from scientific visualization comparing different rendering techniques along camera paths.  

 Enhancing the Configuration Tuning Pipeline of Large-Scale Distributed Applications Using Large Language Models (Idea Paper)   
 Gagan Somashekar 
  Rajat Kumar 
  The performance of distributed applications implemented using microservice architecture depends heavily on the configuration of various parameters, which are hard to tune due to large configuration search space and inter-dependence of parameters. While the information in product manuals and technical documents guides the tuning process, manual collection of meta-data for all application parameters is laborious and not scalable. Prior works have largely overlooked the automated use of product manuals, technical documents and source code for extracting such meta-data. In the current work, we propose using large language models for automated meta-data extraction and enhancing the configuration tuning pipeline. We further ideate on building an in-house knowledge system using experimental data to learn important parameters in configuration tuning using historical data on parameter dependence, workload statistics, performance metrics and resource utilization. We expect productionizing the proposed system will reduce the total time and experimental iterations required for configuration tuning in new applications, saving an organization both developer time and money.  

 A Case of Multi-Resource Fairness for Serverless Workflows (Work In Progress Paper)   
 Amit Samanta 
  Ryan Stutsman 
  Serverless platforms have exploded in popularity in recent years, but, today, these platforms are still unsuitable for large classes of applications. They perform well for batch-oriented workloads that perform coarse transformations over data asynchronously, but their lack of clear service level agreements (SLAs), high per-invocation overheads, and interference make deploying online applications with stringent response time demands impractical.  
 Our assertion is that beyond the glaring issues like cold start costs, a more fundamental shift is needed in how serverless function invocations are provisioned and scheduled in order to support these more demanding applications. Specifically, we propose a platform that leverages the observability and predictability of serverless functions to enforce multi-resource fairness. We explain why we believe interference across a spectrum of resources (CPU, network, and storage) contributes to lower resource utilization and poor response times for latency-sensitive and high-fanout serverless application patterns. Finally, we propose a new distributed and hierarchical function scheduling architecture that combines lessons from multi-resource fair scheduling, hierarchical scheduling, batch-analytics resource scheduling, and statistics to create an approach that we believe will enable tighter SLAs on serverless platforms than has been possible in the past.

  SPEC benchmarks are crucial contributors behind the improvement of server efficiency since 2007, given their role in making the power consumption and efficiency of servers transparent for government regulators, customers, and the manufacturers themselves.  
 As the IT landscape experiences radical transformations, efficiency benchmarks need to be updated accordingly to generate results relevant to government regulators, manufacturers, and customers. In this paper, we outline current challenges efficiency benchmark developers are tackling and highlight recent technological developments the next generation of efficiency benchmarks should take into account.  

 A Reference Architecture for Datacenter Scheduler Programming Abstractions: Design and Experiments (Work In Progress Paper)   
 Aratz Manterola Lasa 
  Sacheendra Talluri 
  Alexandru Iosup 
  Datacenters are the backbone of our digital society, used by the industry, academic researchers, public institutions, etc. To manage resources, data centers make use of sophisticated schedulers. Each scheduler offers a different set of capabilities and users make use of them through the APIs they offer. However, there is not a clear understanding of what programming abstractions they offer, nor why they offer some and not others. Consequently, it is difficult to understand the differences between them and the performance costs that are imposed by their APIs. In this work, we study the programming abstractions offered by industrial schedulers, their shortcomings, and the performance costs of the shortcomings. We propose a general reference architecture for scheduler programming abstractions. Specifically, we analyze the programming abstractions of five popular industrial schedulers, we analyze the differences in their APIs, we identify the missing abstractions, and finally, we carry out an exemplary experiment to demonstrate that schedulers sacrifice performance by under-implementing programming abstractions. In the experiments, we demonstrate that an API extension can improve task runtime by up to 23%. This work allows schedulers to identify their shortcomings and points of improvement in their APIs, but most importantly, provides a reference architecture for existing and future schedulers.

  Systematic testing of software performance during development is a persistent challenge, made increasingly important by the magnifying effect of mass software deployment on any savings. In practice, such systematic performance evaluation requires a combination of an efficient and reliable measurement procedure integrated into the development environment, coupled with an automated evaluation of the measurement results and compact reporting of detected performance anomalies.  
 A realistic evaluation of research contributions to systematic software performance testing can benefit from the availability of measurement data that comes from long term development activities in a well documented context. This paper presents a data artifact that aggregates more than 70 machine time years of performance measurements over 7 years of development of the GraalVM Compiler Project, aiming to reduce the costs of evaluating research contributions in this and similar contexts.

 Uncovering Steady State Executions in Java Microbenchmarking with Call Graph Analysis   
 Madeline Janecek 
  Sneh Patel 
  Naser Ezzati-Jivan 
  Developers often use microbenchmarking tools to evaluate the performance of a Java program. These tools run a small section of code multiple times and measure its performance. However, this process can be problematic as Java execution is traditionally divided into two stages: a warmup stage where the JVM's JIT compiler optimizes frequently used code and a steady stage where performance is stable. Measuring performance before reaching the steady stage can provide an inaccurate representation of the program's efficiency. The challenge comes from determining when a program should be considered as in a steady state. In this paper, we propose that call stack sampling data should be considered when conducting steady state performance evaluations. By analyzing this data, we can generate call graphs for individual microbenchmark executions. Our proposed method of using call stack sampling data and visualizing call graphs intuitively empowers developers to effectively distinguish between warmup and steady state executions. Additionally, by utilizing machine learning classification techniques this method can automate the steady state detection, working towards a more accurate and efficient performance evaluation process.  

 A Study of Java Microbenchmark Tail Latencies   
 Sen He 
  In Kee Kim 
  Wei Wang 
  As Java microbenchmarks are great at profiling the performance of essential code elements, they are widely adopted for Java performance testing. Performance testing using Java microbenchmarks is composed of two phases: the warmup phase and the steady phase. Usually, testing results from the warmup phase are discarded because of the highly fluctuating performance caused by the optimization of Java Virtual Machine. The performance results collected during the steady phase are used for performance evaluation as they are assumed to be more stable. However, according to our study, severe performance fluctuations also occur during the steady phase, which leads to long tail latencies. Long tail latencies constitute a big problem in modern Java systems (of course, other systems and applications) as they hurt the user experience by prolonging the overall execution time.  
 In this paper, we extensively evaluated the long tail performance of 586 Java microbenchmarks from 30 Java systems. The evaluation results show that, for 38% of the benchmarks in steady phase, their 99%tile execution times are over 30% higher than their median execution times. In the worst-case scenario, the 99%ile performance is 659 times higher than the median performance. Furthermore, the 95%ile execution times are above 30% higher than the median execution times for 11% of the steady phase benchmarks.  

 Efficient Data Processing: Assessing the Performance of Different Programming Languages

  This paper compares the performance of R, Python, and Rust in the context of data processing tasks. A real-world data processing task in the form of an aggregation of benchmark measurement results was implemented in each language, and their execution times were measured. The results indicate that while all languages can perform the tasks effectively, there are significant differences in performance. Even the same code showed significant runtime differences depending on the interpreter used for execution. Rust and Python were the most efficient, with R requiring much longer execution times. Additionally, the paper discusses the potential implications of these findings for data scientists and developers when choosing a language for data processing projects.

  Source code analysis is an important aspect of software development that provides insight into a program's quality, security and performance. There are few methods for consistently predicting or determining when a written piece of code will end its warm-up state and proceed to a steady state. In this study, we use the data gathered by the SEALABQualityGroup at the University of L'Aquila and Charles University and extend their research of steady state analysis to determine whether certain source code features could provide a basis for developers to make more informed predictions on when a steady state would occur. We explore if there is a direct correlation between source code features on the time and ability of a Java microbenchmark to reach a steady state to build a machine learning-based approach for steady-state prediction. We found that the correlation between source code features and the probability of reaching a steady state go as high as 10.9% for Pearson's correlation coefficient, whereas the correlation between source code features and the time it takes to reach a steady state go as high as 21.6% for Spearman's correlation coefficient. Our results also show that a K Nearest Neighbour Classifier with features selected with either Spearman's or Kendall's correlation coefficient boasts an accuracy of 78.6%.

  Stable and repeatable measurements are essential for comparing the performance of different systems or applications, and benchmarks are used to ensure accuracy and replication. However, if the corresponding measurements are not stable and repeatable, wrong conclusions can be drawn. To facilitate the task of determining whether the measurements are similar, we used a data set of 586 micro-benchmarks to (i) analyze the data set itself, (ii) examine our previous approach, and (iii) propose and evaluate a heuristic. To evaluate the different approaches, we perform a peer review to assess the dissimilarity of the benchmark runs. Our results show that this task is challenging even for humans and that our heuristic exhibits a sensitivity of 92%.  

 Identification and Classification of JMH Microbenchmark States using Time Series Analysis   
 Tom Wallace 
  Beatrice Ombuki-Berman 
  Naser Ezzati-Jivan 
  The practice of microbenchmarking is very important for observing the performance of code. As such, observing the states and anomalies experienced by the program during a benchmark is equally important. This paper attempts to evaluate the effectiveness of the matrix profile method when applied to analyse JMH benchmarks in time series format, to determine if it is a viable alternative to proven methods. We observe that, when using the matrix profile method, there is a statistically significant difference between the results of the analysis on steady state and non-steady state benchmarks. By comparing results of the matrix profile method and the proven changepoint analysis method, we are able to prove a stronger correlation between the two when the benchmark tested is non-steady state versus that of steady state.  

 Software Mining -- Investigating Correlation between Source Code Features and Michrobenchmark's Steady State   
 Amirmahdi Khosravi Tabrizi 
  Naser Ezzati-Jivan 
  Microbenchmarking is a widely used method for evaluating the performance of a piece of code. However, the results of microbenchmarks for applications that utilize the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) are often unstable during the initial phase of execution, known as the warmup phase. This is due to the JVM's use of just-in-time compiler optimization, which is to identify and compile a "hot set" of important code regions. In this study we examine the static features of 586 microbenchmarks from 30 Java applications. To do so, we first extract static source code features of the benchmarks and then employ manual and descriptive data mining methods to identify meaningful correlations between these static features and the benchmarks' ability to reach a steady state. Our findings indicate that the number of function calls and lines of code have a considerable influence on whether or not the microbenchmarks reach a steady state.

 Towards Evaluation/Mitigation Risk of Systemic Failures in a Recoverable Network with Redistributed Elastic Load   
 Vladimir Marbukh 
  While systemic failure/overload in recoverable networks with load redistribution is a common phenomenon, current ability to evaluate and moreover mitigate the corresponding systemic risk is vastly insufficient due to complexity of the problem and relying on oversimplified models. The proposed in this paper framework for systemic risk evaluation relies on approximate dimension reduction at the onset of systemic failure. Assuming a general failure/recovery microscopic model, the macro-level system dynamics is approximated by a 2-state Markov process alternating between systemically operational and failed states.

 PerfoRT: A Tool for Software Performance Regression   
 Paulo Roberto Farah 
  Silvia Regina Vergilio 
  In this paper, we present PerfoRT, a tool to ease software performance regression measurement of Java systems. Its main characteristics include: minimal configuration to ease automation and hide complexity to the end user; a broad scope of performance metrics including system, process, JVM, and tracing; and presentation of the results from a developer's perspective. We show some of its features in a usage example using Apache Commons BCEL project.  

 SESSION: Tutorials  
 Parallel Performance Engineering using Score-P and Vampir   
 William Williams 
  Holger Brunst 
  This tutorial will introduce participants to the Score-P measurement system and the Vampir trace visualization tool for performance analysis. We will provide examples and hands-on exercises covering the full performance engineering workflow cycle on applications that include MPI, OpenMP, and GPU parallelism. Users will learn the following concepts: 1. How to collect an initial profile of their code with Score-P. 2. Evaluation of that profile and its associated measurement overhead. 3. The concepts of scoring and filtering a profile and measurement respectively. 4. How to control the Score-P measurement system via environment variables. 5. How to collect useful traces with acceptable overhead. 6. How to understand trace visualization in Vampir.  

 Core-Level Performance Engineering with the Open-Source Architecture Code Analyzer (OSACA) and the Compiler Explorer   
 Jan Laukemann 
  Georg Hager 
  While many developers put a lot of effort into optimizing large-scale parallelism, they often neglect the importance of an efficient serial code. Even worse, slow serial code tends to scale very well, hiding the fact that resources are wasted because no definite hardware performance limit ("bottleneck") is exhausted. This tutorial conveys the required knowledge to develop a thorough understanding of the interactions between software and hardware on the level of a single CPU core and the lowest memory hierarchy level (the L1 cache). We introduce general out-of-order core architectures and their typical performance bottlenecks using modern x86-64 (Intel Ice Lake) and ARM (Fujitsu A64FX) processors as examples. We then go into detail about x86 and AArch64 assembly code, specifically including vectorization (SIMD), pipeline utilization, critical paths, and loop-carried dependencies. We also demonstrate performance analysis and performance engineering using the Open-Source Architecture Code Analyzer (OSACA) in combination with a dedicated instance of the well-known Compiler Explorer. Various hands-on exercises allow attendees to make their own experiments and measurements and identify in-core performance bottlenecks. Furthermore, we show real-life use cases to emphasize how profitable in-core performance engineering can be.  

 SESSION: First Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Performance Modeling, Prediction, and Control (AIPerf 2023)  
 ICPE'23 AIPerf Workshop Chairs' Welcome   
 Emilio Incerto 
  Marin Litoiu 
  Riccardo Pinciroli 
  We are pleased to welcome you to the 2023 ACM Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Performance Modeling, Prediction, and Control - AIPerf'23.  
 In its first edition, AIPerf intends to foster the usage of AI (such as probabilistic methods, machine learning, and deep learning) to control, model, and predict the performance of computer systems. The relevance of these topics reflects current and future trends toward exploiting AI-based approaches to deal with complex, large, and interconnected systems. Despite AI and ML being widely adopted techniques to investigate several mainstream domains, their usage for performance modeling and evaluation is still limited, and their benefit to the performance engineering field remains unclear. AIPerf proposes a meeting venue to promote the dissemination of research works that use or study AI techniques for quantitative analysis of modern ICT systems and to engage academics and practitioners of this field. The workshop focuses on presenting experiences and results of applying AI/ML-based techniques to performance-related problems, as well as sharing performance datasets and benchmarks with the community to facilitate the development of new and more accurate learning procedures.  
 Putting together AIPerf'23 was a team effort. We first thank the authors for providing the content of the program. We are grateful to the program committee and the senior program committee, who worked very hard to review papers and provide authors' feedback. Finally, We thank the ICPE23 organizers for sponsoring AIPerf in its community.  
 We hope that you will find this program interesting and thought-provoking and that the symposium will provide you with a valuable opportunity to share ideas with other researchers and practitioners from institutions around the world.  

 Let's Take Back Control: A Journey through a Novel Generation of Control Techniques for Performance Engineering   
 Daniele Masti 
  Optimizing the performance of complex systems has always been a central issue for the control theory community. However, ideas and tools from this field often require very precise assumptions and extensive tuning to perform well, making them unsuited for a non-specialist practitioner.  
 In recent times, however, the influx of the machine learning community has brought a wave of renewal in the field, making many of these powerful methods finally applicable outside academic examples.  
 In this talk, I will discuss my journey at the border between control theory and machine learning, from classical system identification and model-based control to modern autotuning data-driven techniques. I will also shed light on how this novel generation of much more user-friendly techniques can easily be applied to improve the performance of a large class of systems, including software ones.  

 Using Reinforcement Learning to Control Auto-Scaling of Distributed Applications   
 Gabriele Russo Russo 
  Modern distributed systems can benefit from the availability of large-scale and heterogeneous computing infrastructures. However, the complexity and dynamic nature of these environments also call for self-adaptation abilities, as guaranteeing efficient resource usage and acceptable service levels through static configurations is very difficult.  
 In this talk, we discuss a hierarchical auto-scaling approach for distributed applications, where application-level managers steer the overall process by supervising component-level adaptation managers. Following a bottom-up approach, we first discuss how to exploit model-free and model-based reinforcement learning to compute auto-scaling policies for each component. Then, we show how Bayesian optimization can be used to automatically configure the lower-level auto-scalers based on application-level objectives. As a case study, we consider distributed data stream processing applications, which process high-volume data flows in near real-time and cope with varying and unpredictable workloads.  

 OSCAR-P and aMLLibrary: Performance Profiling and Prediction of Computing Continua Applications   
 Enrico Galimberti

  Hamta Sedghani 
  Danilo Ardagna 
  Germán Moltó 
  Miguel Caballer 
  This paper proposes an auto-profiling tool for OSCAR, an open-source platform able to support serverless computing in cloud and edge environments. The tool, named OSCAR-P, is designed to automatically test a specified application workflow on different hardware and node combinations, obtaining relevant information on the execution time of the individual components. It then uses the collected data to build performance models using machine learning, making it possible to predict the performance of the application on unseen configurations. The preliminary evaluation of the performance models accuracy is promising, showing a mean absolute percentage error for extrapolation lower than 10%.  

 Towards Novel Statistical Methods for Anomaly Detection in Industrial Processes   
 Simone Tonini 
  Fernando Barsacchi 
  Francesca Chiaromonte 
  Daniele Licari 
  Andrea Vandin 
  This paper presents a novel methodology based on first principles of statistics and statistical learning for anomaly detection in industrial processes and IoT environments. We present a 5-level analytical pipeline that cleans, smooths, and eliminates redundancies from the data, and identifies outliers as well as the features that contribute most to these anomalies. We show how smoothing can make our methodology less sensitive to short-lived anomalies that might be, e.g., due to sensor noise. We validate the methodology on a dataset freely available in the literature. Our results show that we can identify all anomalies in the considered dataset, with the ability of controlling the amount of false positives. This work is the result of a research project co-funded by the Tuscany Region and a company leader in the paper and nonwovens sector. Although the methodology was developed for this domain, we consider here a dataset from a different industrial sector. This shows that our methodology can be generalized to other contexts with similar constraints on limited resources, interpretability, time, and budget.  

 SESSION: First FastContinuum Workshop (Fast Continuum 2023)  
 ICPE'23 Fast Continuum Workshop Chairs' Welcome   
 Danilo Ardagna 
  Elisabetta Di Nitto

  Francesc Lordan 
  It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the first FastContinuum Workshop held on April 16th 2023. The goal of the workshop is to foster discussion and collaboration among researchers from cloud/edge/fog computing and performance analysis communities, to share the relevant topics and results of the current approaches proposed by industry and academia. FastContinuum solicited full papers as well as demo and short papers including reports about research activities not mature enough for a full paper as well as new ideas and vision papers.  
 The final program includes four full papers and three short ones. They cover some of the most interesting areas of computing continua, from FaaS development and acceleration to the management of heterogeneous datasets to the development of Infrastructure as Code and the automation of deployment through the computing continuum. DevSecOps is also brought to the attendees' attention as one of the crucial ingredients for proper management of the continuum.  
 The workshop keynote, given by Samuel Kunev, investigates further the area of serverless computing properly positioning the multiple aspects and approaches developed in this area and highlighting the main challenges related to the performance of these approaches. The keynote is held in collaboration with the eleventh International Workshop on Load Testing and Benchmarking of Software Systems (LTB 2023).  

 On the Acceleration of FaaS Using Remote GPU Virtualization

  Federico Silla 
  Serverless computing and, in particular, Function as a Service (FaaS) has introduced novel computational approaches with its highly-elastic capabilities, per-millisecond billing and scale-to-zero capacities, thus being of interest for the computing continuum. Services such as AWS Lambda allow efficient execution of event-driven short-lived bursty applications, even if there are limitations in terms of the amount of memory and the lack of GPU support for accelerated execution. To this aim, this paper analyses the suitability of including GPU support in AWS Lambda through the rCUDA middleware, which provides CUDA applications with remote GPU execution capabilities. A reference architecture for data-driven accelerated processing is introduced, based on elastic queues and event-driven object storage systems to manage resource contention and GPU scheduling. The benefits and limitations are assessed through a use case of sequence alignment. The results indicate that, for certain scenarios, the usage of remote GPUs in AWS Lambda represents a viable approach to reduce the execution time.

  The ability to split applications across different locations in the continuum (edge/cloud) creates needs for application break down into smaller and more distributed chunks. In this realm the Function as a Service approach appears as a significant enabler in this process. The paper presents a visual function and workflow development environment for complex FaaS (Apache OpenwhisK) applications. The environment offers a library of pattern based and reusable nodes and flows while mitigating function orchestration limitations in the domain. Generation of the deployable artefacts, i.e. the functions, is performed through embedded DevOps pipelines. A range of annotations are available for dictating diverse options including QoS needs, function or data locality requirements, function affinity considerations etc. These are propagated to the deployment and operation stacks for supporting the cloud/edge interplay. The mechanism is evaluated functionally through creating, registering and executing functions and orchestrating workflows, adapting typical parallelization patterns and an edge data collection process.  

 Heterogeneous Datasets for Federated Survival Analysis Simulation   
 Alberto Archetti 
  Eugenio Lomurno 
  Francesco Lattari 
  André Martin 
  Matteo Matteucci 
  Survival analysis studies time-modeling techniques for an event of interest occurring for a population. Survival analysis found widespread applications in healthcare, engineering, and social sciences. However, the data needed to train survival models are often distributed, incomplete, censored, and confidential. In this context, federated learning can be exploited to tremendously improve the quality of the models trained on distributed data while preserving user privacy. However, federated survival analysis is still in its early development, and there is no common benchmarking dataset to test federated survival models. This work provides a novel technique for constructing realistic heterogeneous datasets by starting from existing non-federated datasets in a reproducible way. Specifically, we propose two dataset-splitting algorithms based on the Dirichlet distribution to assign each data sample to a carefully chosen client: quantity-skewed splitting and label-skewed splitting. Furthermore, these algorithms allow for obtaining different levels of heterogeneity by changing a single hyperparameter. Finally, numerical experiments provide a quantitative evaluation of the heterogeneity level using log-rank tests and a qualitative analysis of the generated splits. The implementation of the proposed methods is publicly available in favor of reproducibility and to encourage common practices to simulate federated environments for survival analysis.  

 Continuum: Automate Infrastructure Deployment and Benchmarking in the Compute Continuum   
 Matthijs Jansen

  Animesh Trivedi 
  Alexandru Iosup 
  As the next generation of diverse workloads like autonomous driving and augmented/virtual reality evolves, computation is shifting from cloud-based services to the edge, leading to the emergence of a cloud-edge compute continuum. This continuum promises a wide spectrum of deployment opportunities for workloads that can leverage the strengths of cloud (scalable infrastructure, high reliability), edge (energy efficient, low latencies), and endpoints (sensing, user-owned). Designing and deploying software in the continuum is complex because of the variety of available hardware, each with unique properties and trade-offs. In practice, developers have limited access to these resources, limiting their ability to create software deployments. To simplify research and development in the compute continuum, in this paper, we propose Continuum, a framework for automated infrastructure deployment and benchmarking that helps researchers and engineers to deploy and test their use cases in a few lines of code. Continuum can automatically deploy a wide variety of emulated infrastructures and networks locally and in the cloud, install software for operating services and resource managers, and deploy and benchmark applications for users with diverse configuration options. In our evaluation, we show how our design covers these requirements, allowing Continuum to be (i) highly flexible, supporting any computing model, (ii) highly configurable, allowing users to alter framework components using an intuitive API, and (iii) highly extendable, allowing users to add support for more infrastructure, applications, and more. Continuum is available at https://github.com/atlarge-research/continuum.  

 Challenges Towards Modeling and Generating Infrastructure-as-Code   
 Galia Novakova Nedeltcheva

  Debora Benedetto 
  The infrastructure-as-code (IaC) is an approach for automating the deployment, maintenance, and monitoring of environments for online services and applications that developers usually do manually. The benefit is not only reducing the time and effort but also the operational costs. This paper aims at describing our experience in applying IaC in cloud-native applications, mainly discussing the key challenges towards modeling and generating IaC faced in the ongoing project Programming Trustworthy Infrastructure-As-Code in a Secure Framework (PIACERE). The concluding insights could spur the wider adoption of IaC by software developers.

  Over the last few years, DevOps methodologies have promoted a more streamlined operationalization of software components in production environments. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) technologies play a key role in the lifecycle management of applications, as they promote the delivery of the infrastructural elements alongside the application components. This way, IaC technologies aspire to minimize the problems associated with the environment by providing a repeatable and traceable process. However, there are a large variety of IaC frameworks, each of them focusing on a different phase of the operationalization lifecycle, hence the necessity to master numerous technologies. In this research, we present the IaC Execution Manager (IEM), a tool devoted to providing a unified framework for the operationalization of software components that encompasses the various stages and technologies involved in the application lifecycle. We analyze an industrial use case to improve the current approach and conclude the IEM is a suitable tool for solving the problem as it promotes automation, while reducing the learning curve associated with the required IaC technologies.

  Security represents one of the crucial concerns when it comes to DevOps methodology-empowered software development and service delivery process. Considering the adoption of Infrastructure as Code (IaC), even minor flaws could potentially cause fatal consequences, especially in sensitive domains such as healthcare and maritime applications. However, most of the existing solutions tackle either Static Application Security Testing (SAST) or run-time behavior analysis distinctly. In this paper, we propose a) IaC Scan Runner, an open-source solution developed in Python for inspecting a variety of state-of-the-art IaC languages in application design time and b) the run time anomaly detection tool called LOMOS. Both tools work in synergy and provide a valuable contribution to a DevSecOps tool set. The proposed approach is demonstrated and their results will be demonstrated on various case studies showcasing the capabilities of static analysis tool IaC Scan Runner combined with LOMOS - log analysis artificial intelligence-enabled framework.  

 SESSION: First Workshop on Serverless, Extreme-Scale, and Sustainable Graph Processing Systems (GraphSys 2023)  
 ICPE'23 GraphSys Workshop Chairs Introduction (Welcome)   
 Alexandru Iosup 
  Radu Prodan 
  It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2023 ACM/SPEC Workshop on Serverless, Extreme-Scale, and Sustainable Graph Processing Systems. This is the first such workshop, aiming to facilitate the exchange of ideas and expertise in the broad field of high-performance large-scale graph processing.  
 Graphs and GraphSys - The use, interoperability, and analytical exploitation of graph data are essential for modern digital economies. Today, thousands of computational methods (algorithms) and findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) graph datasets exist. However, current computational capabilities lag when faced with the complex workflows involved in graph processing, the extreme scale of existing graph datasets, and the need to consider sustainability metrics in graph-processing operations. Needs are emerging for graph-processing platforms to provide multilingual information processing and reasoning based on the massive graph representation of extreme data in the form of general graphs, knowledge graphs, and property graphs. Because graph workloads and graph datasets are strongly irregular, and involve one or several big data "Vs" (e.g., volume, velocity, variability, vicissitude), the community needs to reconsider traditional approaches in performance analysis and modeling, system architectures and techniques, serverless and "as a service" operation, real-world and simulation-driven experimentation, etc., and provide new tools and instruments to address emerging challenges in graph processing.  
 Graphs or linked data are crucial to innovation, competition, and prosperity and establish a strategic investment in technical processing and ecosystem enablers. Graphs are universal abstractions that capture, combine, model, analyze, and process knowledge about real and digital worlds into actionable insights through item representation and interconnectedness. For societally relevant problems, graphs are extreme data that require further technological innovations to meet the needs of the European data economy. Digital graphs help pursue the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDG) by enabling better value chains, products, and services for more profitable or green investments in the financial sector and deriving trustworthy insight for creating sustainable communities. All science, engineering, industry, economy, and society-at-large domains can leverage graph data for unique analysis and insight, but only if graph processing becomes easy to use, fast, scalable, and sustainable.  
 GraphSys is a cross-disciplinary meeting venue focusing on state-of-the-art and the emerging (future) graph processing systems. We invite experts and trainees in the field, across academia, industry, governance, and society, to share experience and expertise leading to a shared body of knowledge, to formulate together a vision for the field, and to engage with the topics to foster new approaches, techniques, and solutions.

  Our society is increasingly digital, and its processes are increasingly digitalized. As an emerging technology for the digital society, graphs provide a universal abstraction to represent concepts and objects, and the relationships between them. However, processing graphs at a massive scale raises numerous sustainability challenges; becoming energy-aware could help graph-processing infrastructure alleviate its climate impact. Graph Greenifier aims to address this challenge in the conceptual framework offered by the Graph Massivizer architecture. We present an early vision of how Graph Greenifier could provide sustainability analysis and decision-making capabilities for extreme graph-processing workloads. Graph Greenifier leverages an advanced digital twin for data center operations, based on the OpenDC open-source simulator, a novel toolchain for workload-driven simulation of graph processing at scale, and a sustainability predictor. The input to the digital twin combines monitoring of the information and communication technology infrastructure used for graph processing with data collected from the power grid. Graph Greenifier thus informs providers and consumers on operational sustainability aspects, requiring mutual information sharing, reducing energy consumption for graph analytics, and increasing the use of electricity from renewable sources.  

 metaphactory for Massive Graphs   
 Aaron Eberhart 
  Peter Haase 
  Wolfgang Schell 
  Knowledge Graphs and semantic technologies allow scientists and domain experts to model complex relations between data in a logically structured and machine readable format. metaphactory is a platform that enables users to build these kinds of semantic graphs easily and efficiently. metaphactory uses standards such as RDF in combination with OWL, SKOS, SHACL, and others to provide a flexible endpoint to interact with graphs of varying complexity and expressivity. As part of the Graph-Massivizer project, metaphactory is supporting integration and infrastructure consolidation for components developed in the project. Part of this work is to develop a toolkit which metaphactory uses to process very large graphs without sacrificing sustainability. In this paper we describe in detail the metaphactory platform and how it supports large-scale graph processing in the Graph-Massivizer project, as well as outlining the current efforts within the project and how they aim to increase capabilities in the present to support future work.  

 Towards Sustainable Serverless Processing of Massive Graphs on the Computing Continuum

  With the ever-increasing volume of data and the demand to analyze and comprehend it, graph processing has become an essential approach for solving complex problems in various domains, like social networks, bioinformatics, and finance. Despite the potential benefits of current graph processing platforms, they often encounter difficulties supporting diverse workloads, models, and languages. Moreover, existing platforms suffer from limited portability and interoperability, resulting in redundant efforts and inefficient resource and energy utilization due to vendor and even platform lock-in. To bridge the aforementioned gaps, the Graph-Massivizer project, funded by the Horizon Europe research and innovation program, conducts research and develops a high-performance, scalable, and sustainable platform for information processing and reasoning based on the massive graph (MG) representation of extreme data. In this paper, we briefly introduce the Graph-Massivizer platform. We explore how the emerging serverless computing paradigm can be leveraged to devise a scalable graph analytics tool over a codesigned computing continuum infrastructure. Finally, we sketch seven crucial research questions in our design and outline three ongoing and future research directions for addressing them.  

 Large-scale Graph Processing and Simulation with Serverless Workflows in Federated FaaS   
 Sashko Ristov 
  Reza Farahani 
  Radu Prodan 
  Serverless computing offers an affordable and easy way to code lightweight functions that can be invoked based on some events to perform simple tasks. For more complicated processing, multiple serverless functions can be orchestrated as a directed acyclic graph to form a serverless workflow, so-called function choreography (FC). Although most famous cloud providers offer FC management systems such as AWS Step Functions, and there are also several open-source FC management systems (e.g., Apache OpenWhisk), their primary focus is on describing the control flow and data flow between serverless functions in the FC. Moreover, the existing FC management systems rarely consider the processed data, which is commonly represented in a graph format. In this paper, we review the capabilities of the existing FC management systems in supporting graph processing applications. We also raise two key research questions related to large-scale graph processing using serverless computing in federated Function-as-a-Service (FaaS). As part of the Graph-Massivizer project, funded by the Horizon Europe research and innovation program, we will research and develop (prototype) solutions that will address these challenges.  

 Boosting the Impact of Extreme and Sustainable Graph Processing for Urgent Societal Challenges in Europe Graph-Massivizer: A Horizon Europe Project   
 Nuria de Lama Sanchez 
  Peter Haase 
  Dumitru Roman 
  Radu Prodan 
  We explore the potential of the Graph-Massivizer project funded by the Horizon Europe research and innovation program of the European Union to boost the impact of extreme and sustainable graph processing for mitigating existing urgent societal challenges. Current graph processing platforms do not support diverse workloads, models, languages, and algebraic frameworks. Existing specialized platforms are difficult to use by non-experts and suffer from limited portability and interoperability, leading to redundant efforts and inefficient resource and energy consumption due to vendor and even platform lock-in. While synthetic data emerged as an invaluable resource overshadowing actual data for developing robust artificial intelligence analytics, graph generation remains a challenge due to extreme dimensionality and complexity. On the European scale, this practice is unsustainable and, thus, threatens the possibility of creating a climate-neutral and sustainable economy based on graph data. Making graph processing sustainable is essential but needs credible evidence. The grand vision of the Graph-Massivizer project is a technological solution, coupled with field experiments and experience-sharing, for a high-performance and sustainable graph processing of extreme data with a proper response for any need and organizational size by 2030.  

 Graph Neural Networks for Anomaly Anticipation in HPC Systems   
 Martin Molan 
  Junaid Ahmed Khan 
  Andrea Borghesi 
  Andrea Bartolini 
  In this paper, we explore the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for anomaly anticipation in high performance computing (HPC) systems. We propose a GNN-based approach that leverages the structure of the HPC system (particularly, the physical proximity of the compute nodes) to facilitate anomaly anticipation. We frame the task of forecasting the availability of the compute nodes as a supervised prediction problem; the GNN predicts the probability that a compute node will fail within a fixed-length future window.  
 We empirically demonstrate the viability of the GNN-based approach by conducting experiments on the production Tier-0 super-computer hosted at CINECA datacenter facilities, the largest Italian provider of HPC. The results are extremely promising, showing both anomaly detection capabilities on par with other techniques from the literature (with a special focus on those tested on real, production data) and, more significantly, strong results in terms of anomaly prediction.  

 Semi-Supervised Event Predictions with Graph Networks   
 Peter Nemec 
  Gregor Leban 
  Joze Rozanec 
  Marko Grobelnik 
  This paper describes how we envision classifying events into the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by utilizing machine learning techniques on global news data. We propose extracting data from a media intelligence platform using an ontology and a classifier to assign each event to its corresponding SDG. To minimize the labeling effort, a few-shot classification approach is employed. Additionally, a labeling tool is developed to facilitate event analysis and assign labels accurately. We envision this approach could be used for analyzing media events at a large scale and track progress towards the SDGs.  

 AI, What Does the Future Hold for Us? Automating Strategic Foresight   
 Joze Rozanec 
  Peter Nemec 
  Gregor Leban 
  Marko Grobelnik 
  There is an increasing awareness that strategic foresight is much needed to guide efficient policy-making. The growing digitalization implies a rising amount of digital evidence of many aspects of society (e.g., science, economy, and politics). Artificial intelligence can process massive amounts of data and extract meaningful information. Furthermore, a knowledge graph can be developed to capture significant aspects of reality, and machine learning models can be used to identify patterns and derive insights. This paper describes how we envision artificial intelligence could be used to create and deliver strategic foresight automatically.  

 Extreme and Sustainable Graph Processing for Green Finance Investment and Trading   
 Laurentiu Alexandru Vasiliu 
  Dumitru Roman 
  Radu Prodan 
  In this paper we present a case addressing the drawbacks of financial market data, its limited volumes, history, and sometimes the incomplete and erroneous datasets with variable quality, limited availability, and price barriers. The case aims to enable fast, semi-automated creation of realistic and affordable synthetic (extreme) financial datasets, unlimited in size and accessibility, ready to be commercialized. Peracton Ltd. intends to apply the resulting extreme financial data multiverse for testing and improving artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced financial algorithms (e.g., using machine learning) focused on green investment and trading. Using synthetic data for testing financial algorithms removes critical biases, such as prior knowledge, overfitting, and indirect contamination due to real-world data scarcity, and ensures data completeness at an affordable cost. The availability of extreme (volumes) of synthetic data will consolidate further financial algorithms and provide a statistically relevant sample size for advanced back-testing.  

 Graph-Scrutinizer: Towards Massive Graph Analytics and Reasoning

  Michael Cochez 
  Ruud van Bakel 
  Brian Elvesæter 
  Dumitru Roman 
  Graphs can represent various phenomena and are increasingly used to tackle complex problems. Among the challenges associated with graph processing is the ability to analyze and mine massive-scale graphs. While the massive scale is usually associated with distributed systems, the complex nature of graphs makes them an exception to the rule. Currently, most graph processing is performed within a single computer. In this research, we describe a solution at a conceptual level in the context of the Graph-Massivizer architecture. We use two approaches to provide graph analytics and querying functionalities at scale. First, we leverage graph sampling techniques to obtain relevant samples and avoid processing the whole graph. Second, we support heuristic and neural query execution engines. We envision an interface that will decide which queries to execute with a given engine, given constraints (e.g., execution time boundaries, exactness of results, energy saving requirements).  

 Graph-Inceptor: Towards Extreme Data Ingestion, Massive Graph Creation and Storage

  Marko Grobelnik 
  Peter Haase 
  Graph processing is increasingly popular given the wide range of phenomena represented as graphs (e.g., social media networks, pharmaceutical drug compounds, or fraud networks, among others). The increasing amount of data available requires new approaches to efficiently ingest and process such data. In this research, we describe a solution at a conceptual level in the context of the Graph-Massivizer architecture. Graph-Inceptor aims to bridge the void among ETL tools enabling data transformations required for graph creation and enrichment and supporting connectors to multiple graph storages at a massive scale. Furthermore, it aims to enhance ETL operations by learning from data content and load and making decisions based on machine-learning-based predictive analytics.  

 Graph-Optimizer: Towards Predictable Large-Scale Graph Processing Workloads   
 Ana Lucia Varbanescu 
  Andrea Bartolini 
  Graph and hardware-specific optimisations lead to orders of magnitude improvements in performance, energy, and cost over conventional graph processing methods. Typical big data platforms, such as Apache MapReduce and Apache Spark, rely on generic primitives, exhibiting poor performance and high financial and environmental costs. Even optimised basic graph operations (BGOs) lack the tools to combine them towards real-world applications. Furthermore, graph topology and dynamics (i.e., changing the number and content of vertices and edges) lead to high variability in computational needs. Primitive predictive models demonstrate they can enable algorithm selection and advanced auto-scaling techniques to ensure better performance, but no such models exist for energy consumption.  
 In this work, we present the Graph-Optimizer tool. Graph-Optimizer uses optimised BGOs and composition rules to capture and model the workload. It combines the workload model with hardware and infrastructure models, predicting performance and energy consumption. Combined with design space exploration, such predictions select codesigned workload implementations to fit a requested performance objective and guarantee their performance bounds during execution.

  It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2023 edition of the Workshop on Hot Topics in Cloud Computing Performance - HotCloudPerf 2023.  
 Cloud computing is emerging as one of the most profound changes in the way we build and use IT. The use of global services in public clouds is increasing, and the lucrative and rapidly growing global cloud market already supports over 1 million IT-related jobs. However, it is currently challenging to make the IT services offered by public and private clouds performant (in an extended sense) and efficient. Emerging architectures, techniques, and real-world systems include interactions with the computing continuum, serverless operation, everything as a service, complex workflows, auto-scaling and -tiering, etc. It is unclear to which extent traditional performance engineering, software engineering, and system design and analysis tools can help with understanding and engineering these emerging technologies. The community needs practical tools and powerful methods to address hot topics in cloud computing performance.  
 Responding to this need, the HotCloudPerf workshop proposes a meeting venue for academics and practitioners, from experts to trainees, in the field of cloud computing performance. The workshop aims to engage this community and to lead to the development of new methodological aspects for gaining a deeper understanding not only of cloud performance, but also of cloud operation and behavior, through diverse quantitative evaluation tools, including benchmarks, metrics, and workload generators. The workshop focuses on novel cloud properties such as elasticity, performance isolation, dependability, and other non-functional system properties, in addition to classical performance-related metrics such as response time, throughput, scalability, and efficiency.  

 Scaling the Metaverse: An AI Perspective   
 Tania Lorido-Botran 
  When one hears the word Metaverse, it is automatically associated with millions of users, immersive experiences and its potential to change our lives. But, what enables the Metaverse to function at such a scale? This talk will present the different challenges associated with handling 55 million daily users within the Roblox Metaverse. From addressing user Quality of Experience, to distributed architecture, programming model and scheduling, we will cover the entire stack underneath. In particular, I will put special attention into the AI-Metaverse relationship. On one hand, a large proportion of workloads are based on one or multiple ML/DL models and I will present the challenges of scaling them. On the other hand, I will explore infrastructure and service model challenges that can be addressed with AI, e.g. multi-resource and multi-datacenter scheduling with Reinforcement learning.  

 Using Cloud Native Technologies to Understand the Performance of Cloud Native Technologies   
 Cristian Klein 
  The ambition of this talk is to seed discussions around how cloud native technologies can help research on performance engineering, but also what are the interesting performance engineering challenges to solve with cloud native technologies.  
 Cloud native technologies are building blocks for creating a modern environment for hosting containerized applications. Amongst others, great focus is placed on observability, which allows engineers to collect and analyze massive amounts of performance data in near real-time. Take as an example service meshes, which are a layer 7 network platform for containerized applications. Service meshes not only allow traffic engineering, but also add observability on top of a microservice application. Amongst other, this allows understanding traffic patterns between microservices, including upstream-downstream relationships, request rate, etc. without writing a single line of code.  
 This talk discusses how cloud native technologies may help researchers in performance engineering. The benefits are three-fold. They allow researchers - e.g., PhD students - to be more productive, by getting the mechanism of collecting performance data out of the way. They improve collaboration because the effects of changing a parameter can be visualized in near real time. Finally, experiments are based on proven technologies with skills more widely available, which helps reproducibility.  
 These benefits are illustrated through our research on adaptive service meshes. Indeed, service meshes have many parameters which impact performance. Discussions with practitioners revealed a gap in understanding on how to effectively choose these parameters. We therefore proposed an adaptive controller that configures a service mesh so as to maintain a target tail response time.  

 How Do ML Jobs Fail in Datacenters? Analysis of a Long-Term Dataset from an HPC Cluster   
 Xiaoyu Chu 
  Sacheendra Talluri 
  Laurens Versluis 
  Alexandru Iosup 
  Reliable job execution is important in High Performance Computing clusters. Understanding the failure distribution and failure pattern of jobs helps HPC cluster managers design better systems, and users design fault tolerant systems. Machine learning is an increasingly popular workload for HPC clusters are used for. But, there is little information on machine learning job failure characteristics on HPC clusters, and how they differ from the previous workload such clusters were used for. The goal of our work is to improve the understanding of machine learning job failures in HPC clusters. We collect and analyze job data spanning the whole of 2022, and over 2~million jobs. We analyze basic statistical characteristics, the time pattern of failures, resource waste caused by failures, and their autocorrelation. Some of our findings are that machine learning jobs fail at a higher rate than non-ML jobs, and waste much more CPU-time per job when they fail.  

 Securing the Execution of ML Workflows across the Compute Continua   
 Francesc-Josep Lordan Gomis 
  André Martin 
  Daniele Lezzi 
  Cloud computing has become the major computational paradigm for the deployment of all kind of applications, ranging from mobile apps to complex AI algorithms. On the other side, the rapid growth of IoT market has led to the need of processing the data produced by smart devices using their embedded resources. The computing continuum paradigm aims at solving the issues related to the deployment of applications across edge-to-cloud cyber-infrastructures.  
 This work considers in-memory data protection to enhance security over the compute continua and proposes a solution for the development of distributed applications that handles security in a transparent way for the developer. The proposed framework has been evaluated using an ML application that classifies health data using a pre-trained model. The results show that securing in-memory data incurs no additional effort at development time and the overheads introduced by the encryption mechanisms do not compromise the scalability of the application.  

 Hitchhiker's Guide for Explainability in Autoscaling   
 Floriment Klinaku 
  Sandro Speth 
  Markus Zilch 
  Steffen Becker 
  Cloud-native applications force increasingly powerful and complex autoscalers to guarantee the applications' quality of service. For software engineers with operational tasks understanding the autoscalers' behavior and applying appropriate reconfigurations is challenging due to their internal mechanisms, inherent distribution, and decentralized decision-making. Hence, engineers seek appropriate explanations. However, engineers' expectations on feedback and explanations of autoscalers are unclear. In this paper, through a workshop with a representative sample of engineers responsible for operating an autoscaler, we elicit requirements for explainability in autoscaling. Based on the requirements, we propose an evaluation scheme for evaluating explainability as a non-functional property of the autoscaling process and guide software engineers in choosing the best-fitting autoscaler for their scenario. The evaluation scheme is based on a Goal Question Metric approach and contains three goals, nine questions to assess explainability, and metrics to answer these questions. The evaluation scheme should help engineers choose a suitable and explainable autoscaler or guide them in building their own.  

 Enhancing Trace Visualizations for Microservices Performance Analysis   
 Jessica Leone 
  Luca Traini 
  Performance analysis of microservices can be a challenging task, as a typical request to these systems involves multiple Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) spanning across independent services and machines. Practitioners primarily rely on distributed tracing tools to closely monitor microservices performance. These tools enable practitioners to trace, collect, and visualize RPC workflows and associated events in the context of individual end-to-end requests. While effective for analyzing individual end-to-end requests, current distributed tracing visualizations often fall short in providing a comprehensive understanding of the system's overall performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel visualization approach that enables aggregate performance analysis of multiple end-to-end requests. Our approach builds on a previously developed technique for comparing structural differences of request pairs and extends it for aggregate performance analysis of sets of requests. This paper presents our proposal and discusses our preliminary ongoing progress in developing this innovative approach.  

 Performance Experiences From Running An E-health Inference Process As FaaS Across Diverse Clusters   
 George Kousiouris 
  Aristodemos Pnevmatikakis 
  In this paper we report our experiences from the migration of an AI model inference process, used in the context of an E-health platform to the Function as a Service model. To that direction, a performance analysis is applied, across three available Cloud or Edge FaaS clusters based on the open source Apache Openwhisk FaaS platform. The aim is to highlight differences in performance based on the characteristics of each cluster, the request rates and the parameters of Openwhisk. The conclusions can be applied for understanding the expected behavior of the inference function in each of these clusters as well as the effect of the Openwhisk execution model. Key observations and findings are reported on aspects such as function execution duration, function sizing, wait time in the system, network latency and concurrent container overheads for different load rates. These can be used to detect in a black box manner capabilities of unknown clusters, guide or fine-tune performance models as well as private cloud FaaS deployment setup.  

 Can My WiFi Handle the Metaverse? A Performance Evaluation Of Meta's Flagship Virtual Reality Hardware   
 Matthijs Jansen 
  Jesse Donkervliet 
  Animesh Trivedi 
  Alexandru Iosup 
  Extending human societies into virtual space through the construction of a metaverse has been a long-term challenge in both industry and academia. Achieving this challenge is now closer than ever due to advances in computer systems, facilitating large-scale online platforms such as Minecraft and Roblox that fulfill an increasing number of societal needs, and extended reality (XR) hardware, which provides users with state-of-the-art immersive experiences. For a metaverse to succeed, we argue that all involved systems must provide consistently good performance. However, there is a lack of knowledge on the performance characteristics of extended reality devices. In this paper, we address this gap and focus on extended- and virtual-reality hardware. We synthesize a user-centered system model that models common deployments of XR hardware and their trade-offs. Based on this model, we design and conduct real-world experiments with Meta's flagship virtual reality device, the Quest Pro. We highlight two surprising results from our findings which show that (i) under our workload, the battery drains 15% faster when using wireless offloading compared to local execution, and (ii) the outdated 2.4 GHz WiFi4 gives surprisingly good performance, with 99% of samples achieving a frame rate of at least 65 Hz, compared to the 72 Hz performance target. Our experimental setup and data are available at https://github.com/atlarge-research/measuring-the-metaverse.  

 SESSION: Eleventh International Workshop on Load Testing and Benchmarking of Software Systems (LTB 2023)  
 LTB'23 Workshop Chairs' Welcome   
 Alexander Podelko 
  Heng Li 
  Changyuan Lin 
  It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the eleventh edition of the International Workshop on Load Testing and Benchmarking of Software Systems - LTB 2023, https://ltb2023.github.io/). This one-day workshop brings together software testing and software performance researchers, practitioners, and tool developers to discuss the challenges and opportunities of conducting research on load testing and benchmarking software systems, including theory, applications, and experiences. LTB 2023 included 2 keynote talks, 2 research papers, and 4 industry presentations. The topics cover performance of serverless computing, performance and load testing, performance-driven culture, workload generation, workload tracing, benchmarking, and performance verification.  

 Understanding and Improving Software Performance at MongoDB   
 David Daly 
  It is important for developers to understand the performance of a software project as they develop new features, fix bugs, and try to generally improve the product. At MongoDB we have invested in building a performance infrastructure to support our developers. The infrastructure automates the provisioning of systems under test, the running of performance tests against those systems, collecting many metrics from the tests and system under test, and making sense of all the results.  
 Our performance infrastructure and processes are continually changing. As the system has become more powerful we have used it more and more: adding new tests, new configurations, and new measurements. Tools and processes that work on one scale of use start to break down at higher scales and we must adapt and update. If we do a good job, we keep pace with the rising constraints. If we do a great job, we make the system fundamentally better even as we scale the system.  
 In this talk we describe our performance testing environment at MongoDB and its evolution over time. The core of our environment is a focus on automating everything, integrating into our continuous integration (CI) system (Evergreen), controlling as many factors as possible, and making everything as repeatable and consistent as possible. After describing that core, we will discuss the scaling challenges we have faced, before relating what we have done to address those scaling challenges and improve the system overall.  

 Serverless Computing Revisited: Evolution, State-of-the-Art, and Performance Challenges   
 Samuel Kounev 
  Market analysts are agreed that serverless computing has strong market potential, with projected compound annual growth rates varying between 21% and 28% through 2028 and a projected market value of 36.8 billion by that time. Although serverless computing has gained significant attention in industry and academia over the past years, there is still no consensus about its unique distinguishing characteristics and precise understanding of how these characteristics differ from classical cloud computing. For example, there is no wide agreement on whether serverless is solely a set of requirements from the cloud user's perspective or it should also mandate specific implementation choices on the provider side, such as implementing an autoscaling mechanism to achieve elasticity. Similarly, there is no agreement on whether serverless is just the operational part, or it should also include specific programming models, interfaces, or calling protocols. In this talk, we seek to dispel this confusion by evaluating the essential conceptual characteristics of serverless computing as a paradigm, while putting the various terms around it into perspective. We examine how the term serverless computing, and related terms, are used today. We explain the historical evolution leading to serverless computing, starting with mainframe virtualization in the 1960 through to Grid and cloud computing all the way up to today. We review existing cloud computing service models, including IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, CaaS, FaaS, and BaaS, discussing how they relate to the serverless paradigm. In the second part of talk, we focus on performance challenges in serverless computing both from the user's perspective (finding the optimal size of serverless functions) as well as from the provider's perspective (ensuring predictable and fast container start times coupled with fine-granular and accurate elastic scaling mechanisms).  

 Using eBPF for Database Workload Tracing: An Explorative Study   
 Jörg Domaschka 
  Simon Volpert 
  Kevin Maier 
  Georg Eisenhart 
  Daniel Seybold 
  Database management systems~(DBMS) are crucial architectural components of any modern distributed software system. Yet, ensuring a smooth, high-performant operation of a DBMS is a black art that requires tweaking many knobs and is heavily dependent on the experienced workload. Misconfigurations at production systems have an heavy impact on the overall delivered service quality and hence, should be avoided at all costs. Replaying production workload on test and staging systems to estimate the ideal configuration are a valid approach. Yet, this requires traces from the production systems.  
 While many DBMS's have built-in support to capture such traces these have a non-negligible impact on performance. eBPF is a Linux kernel feature claiming to enable low-overhead observability and application tracing. In this paper, we evaluate different eBPF-based approaches to DBMS workload tracing for PostgreSQL and MySQL. The results show that using eBPF causes lower overhead than the built-in mechanisms. Hence, eBPF can be a viable baseline for building a generic tracing framework. Yet, our current results also show that additional optimisation and fine-tuning is needed to further lower the performance overhead.  

 Verifying Transient Behavior Specifications in Chaos Engineering Using Metric Temporal Logic and Property Specification Patterns   
 Sebastian Frank 
  Alireza Hakamian 
  Denis Zahariev 
  André van Hoorn 
  Chaos Engineering is an approach for assessing the resilience of software systems, i.e., their ability to withstand unexpected events, adapt accordingly, and return to a steady state. The traditional Chaos Engineering approach only verifies whether the system is in a steady state and considers no statements about state changes over time and timing. Thus, Chaos Engineering conceptually does not consider transient behavior hypotheses, i.e., specifications regarding the system behavior during the transition between steady states after a failure has been injected. We aim to extend the Chaos Engineering approach and tooling to support the specification of transient behavior hypotheses and their verification.  
 We interviewed three Chaos Engineering practitioners to elicit requirements for extending the Chaos Engineering process. Our concept uses Metric Temporal Logic and Property Specification Patterns to specify transient behavior hypotheses. We then developed a prototype that can be used stand-alone or to complement the established Chaos Engineering framework Chaos Toolkit. We successfully conducted a correctness evaluation comprising 160 test cases from the Timescales benchmark and demonstrate the prototype's applicability in Chaos Experiment settings by executing three chaos experiments.  

 SESSION: First Practically FAIR Workshop (PFAIR 2023)  
 ICPE'23 PFAIR Workshop Chairs Introduction   
 Jay Lofstead 
  Paula Olaya 
  It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2023 ACM Practically FAIR - PFAIR 2023. This workshop builds upon the popular FAIR data principles to investigate and share best practices for adopting FAIR principles in practice. The FAIR proposal only covers some computing and science domains while leaving many unconsidered and also does not prescribe how to achieve the standards in the ideal. As researchers and practitioners begin to meet these standards, we, as a community, need to agree upon what constitutes meeting the principles and how it can be validated. We had a call for research and experience papers and received one submission that met our peer review standards and will fill out our program with a keynote as well as a panel and open discussion.  

 FAIR Enabling Re-Use of Data-Intensive Workflows and Scientific Reproducibility   
 Line C. Pouchard 
  Scientific computing communities often run their experiments using complex data- and compute-intensive workflows that utilize high performance computing (HPC), distributed clusters and specialized architectures targeting machine learning and artificial intelligence. FAIR principles for data and software can be useful enablers for the reproducibility of performance (a key HPC metric) and that of scientific results (a crucial tenet of the scientific method) that are based in part on re-use, the R of FAIR principles. FAIR principles are under-used by HPC and data-intensive communities who have been slow to adopt them. This is due in part to the complexity of workflow life cycles, the numerous workflow management systems, the lack of integration of FAIR within existing technologies, and the specificity of managed systems that include rapidly evolving architectures and software stacks, and execution models that require resource managers and batch schedulers. Numerous challenges emerge for scientists attempting to publish FAIR datasets and software for the purpose of re-use and reproducibility, e.g. what data to publish and where due to sizes, how to "FAIRify" data subsetting, at what level of granularity to attribute persistent identifiers to software, what is the minimal amount of metadata needed to guarantee a certain level of reproducibility, what does reproducible AI actually mean? This talk will focus on such challenges and illustrate the negative impact of not applying FAIR on the reproducibility of experiments. We will introduce the notion of FAIR Digital Objects and present RECUP, a framework for data and metadata services for high performance workflows that proposes micro-solutions for adapting FAIR principles to HPC.  

 Automatic FAIR Provenance Collection and Visualization for Time Series   
 Fadoua Rafii 
  Horacio Gonzalez-Velez 
  Adriana E. Chis 
  Provenance provides data lineage and history of different transformations applied to a dataset. A complete trace of data provenance can enable the reanalysis, reproducibility, and reusability of features, which are essential for validating results and extending them in many projects. Open time series datasets are readily accessible and discoverable, but their full reproducibility and reusability require clear metadata provenance. This paper introduces an assessment of provenance variables using an algorithm for collecting FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) characteristics in open time series and generating an associated provenance graph. We have evaluated the FAIRness of provenance traces by automatically mapping their properties to a provenance data model graph for a case study employing open time series from weather stations. Our approach arguably enables researchers to analyse time series datasets with similar characteristics, prompting new research questions, insights, and investigations. As a result, this approach has the potential to promote reusability and reproducibility, which are critical factors in scientific research.  

 SESSION: Fourth Workshop on Education and Practice of Performance Engineering (WEPPE 2023)  
 WEPPE'23 Workshop Chairs' Welcome   
 Alberto Avritzer 
  Matteo Camilli 
  It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 4th International Workshop on Education and Practice of Performance Engineering - WEPPE 2023. The goal of the Workshop on Education and Practice of Performance Engineering is to bring together University researchers and Industry Performance Engineers to share education and practice experiences. This year's symposium continues its tradition of being a forum for performance engineering educators. We are interested in creating opportunities to share valuable experience between researchers that are actively teaching performance engineering and Performance Engineers that are applying Performance Engineering techniques in industry.  

 Performance Engineering Practices for Modern Industrial Applications at ABB Research   
 Heiko Koziolek 
  ABB is developing a vast range of software services for process automation applications used in chemical production facilities, power plants, and container ships. High responsiveness and resource efficiency is important in this domain both for real-time embedded systems and distributed containerized systems, but performance engineering can be challenging due to system complexity and application domain heterogeneity. This talk provides experiences and lessons learned from several selected case studies on performance engineering. It illustrates testing performance of OPC UA pub/sub communication, clustered MQTT brokers for edge computing, software container online updates, and lightweight Kubernetes frameworks while highlighting the applied practices and tools. The talk reports on challenges in workload modeling, performance testing, and performance modeling.  

 Quantitative Analysis of Software Designs: Teaching Design and Experiences   
 Alireza Hakamian 
  Steffen Becker 
  Context. The Software Quality and Architecture group (SQA) at the University of Stuttgart offers the Quantitative Analysis of Software Designs (QASD) course for master students. The goal is to give students the necessary skill to evaluate architecture alternatives of software systems quantitatively. The course offers a combination of required theoretical skills, such as applying stochastic processes and practical exercises using suitable tools. The challenge is providing teaching materials that balance necessary theoretical knowledge and appropriate tooling that can be used in practice. As a solution, the course is designed so that one-third is about the formalisms behind quantitative analysis, including stochastic processes and queuing theory. One-third is modeling languages, such as queuing networks, UML, and UML profiles, including MARTE. The other one-third uses tooling to model and analyze example systems. During Corona, we provided students with an e-learning module with pre-recorded videos, online quizzes at the end of every chapter, and a virtual machine that pre-installed all the required tooling for the exercise sheets. Final-remarks. In the past two years, students' feedback was often positive regarding the balance between theory and tooling. However, it has to be emphasized that the number of students participating in the course has always been no more than ten. Hence, the student feedback has not been collected by the universities' survey.  

 Early Progress on Enhancing Existing Software Engineering Courses to Cultivate Performance Awareness   
 André Benjamin Bondi 
  Lu Xiao 
  Software engineering and computer science courses are frequently focused on particular areas in a way that neglects such cross-cutting quality attributes as performance, reliability, and security. We will describe the progress we have made in developing enhancements to some of our existing software engineering courses to draw attention and even lay the foundations of an awareness of performance considerations in the software development life cycle. In doing so, we wish to make performance considerations integral to the software engineering mindset while avoiding the need to remove current material from our existing courses. This work is part of an NSF-funded project for undergraduate curriculum development.  

 Theory and Practice in Performance Evaluation Courses: The Challenge of Online Teaching   
 Andrea Marin 
  This paper reports the experience gained over several years of teaching the course entitled Software performance and scalability at the University Ca' Foscari of Venice. The course is taken by perspective computer scientists and is taught at the master's level. It covers the topics of modeling and assessment of the performance properties of software systems.  
 In this paper, we will also devote attention to the challenge of online teaching due to the pandemic conditions.  
 Finally, we propose some auspices for the community to collect material for structured courses on performance and reliability evaluation topics.  

 Levelling up Performance and Performance Skills at MongoDB   
 David Daly 
  MongoDB has invested in developing a performance infrastructure and a corresponding performance culture. All development engineers are expected to improve MongoDB performance, through adding performance tests, optimizing code, and fixing performance regressions. Investing in the infrastructure is clear: we develop and support tools to make it easy to track performance changes and improve performance. Investing in the culture includes formal and informal training. The training must ultimately both support strong developers with very limited performance backgrounds as well as developing our future performance experts.  

 Views From the Trenches: Current Trends in Performance Engineering   
 Alexander Podelko 
  Performance engineering is changing before our eyes adjusting to current industry trends - such as cloud computing, agile development, and DevOps. As systems scale and sophistication skyrocket, performance gets more attention. While it looks like some performance concepts like algorithm complexity became a must for anybody working in the industry, it still doesn't result in a consistent view of performance. So it remains an open question what computer professionals should learn about performance - and, even more challenging, what is needed to prepare performance professionals (that actually have never been clearly answered - and now it is even less defined than it was before).  

 Performance Analysis Tools for MPI Applications and their Use in Programming Education   
 Anna-Lena Roth 
  Tim Süß 
  Performance analysis tools are frequently used to support the development of parallel MPI applications. They facilitate the detection of errors, bottlenecks, or inefficiencies but differ substantially in their instrumentation, measurement, and type of feedback. Especially, tools that provide visual feedback are helpful for educational purposes. They provide a visual abstraction of program behavior, supporting learners to identify and understand performance issues and write more efficient code. However, existing professional tools for performance analysis are very complex, and their use in beginner courses can be very demanding. Foremost, their instrumentation and measurement require deep knowledge and take a long time. Immediate, as well as straightforward feedback, is essential to motivate learners. This paper provides an extensive overview of performance analysis tools for parallel MPI applications, which experienced developers broadly use today. It also gives an overview of existing educational tools for parallel programming with MPI and shows their shortcomings compared to professional tools. Using tools for performance analysis of MPI programs in educational scenarios can promote the understanding of program behavior in large HPC systems and support learning parallel programming. At the same time, the complexity of the programs and the lack of infrastructure in educational institutions are barriers. These aspects will be considered and discussed in detail.  

 SESSION: Eighth Workshop on Challenges in Performance Methods for Software Development (WOSP-C 2023)  
 8th Workshop on Challenges in Performance Methods for Software Development: WOSP-C'23 Chairs' Welcome   
 Daniele Di Pompeo 
  Michele Tucci 
  It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 8th Workshop on Challenges in Performance Methods for Software Development - WOSP-C 2023. This year's workshop continues its tradition of being the forum for the discussion of emerging or unaddressed challenges in software and performance, including challenges in developing software to be performant, concurrent programming issues, performance and architecture, performance measurement, cloud performance, and testing. Its purpose is to open new avenues for research on methods to address continuously emerging performance challenges. The software world is changing, and new challenges are to be expected.  
 We also encourage attendees to attend the keynote and talk presentations. These valuable and insightful talks can and will guide us to a better understanding of the future: Non-Volatile Hardware Transactional Memory: Advancements, Challenges, and Future Directions, Paolo Romano (who is currently at IST, Lisbon University & INESC-ID)  
 Putting together WOSP-C'23 was a team effort. We first thank the authors for providing the content of the program. We are grateful to the program committee, who worked very hard in reviewing papers and providing feedback for authors. Finally, we thank the hosting organization or university, our sponsor, ACM SIGs.  
 We hope that you will find this program interesting and thought-provoking and that the workshop will provide you with a valuable opportunity to share ideas with other researchers and practitioners from institutions around the world.  

 Non-Volatile Hardware Transactional Memory: Challenges, Advancements, and Future Directions   
 Paolo Romano 
  Transactional memory (TM) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to simplify concurrent programming. Nowadays, hardware-based TM (HTM) implementations are available in several mainstream CPUs (e.g., by ARM, Intel and IBM). Due to their hardware nature, HTM implementations spare the cost of software instrumentation and can efficiently detect conflicts by extending existing cache- coherency protocols. However, their cache-centric approach also imposes a number of limitations that impact how effectively such systems can be used in practice.  
 This talk investigates the challenges that arise when leveraging existing HTM systems in conjunction with another recent disrup- tive hardware technology, namely Non-Volatile Memory (NVM). NVM, such as Intel Optane DC, provide much higher density than existing DRAM, while attaining competitive performance and pre- serving DRAM's byte addressability. However, the cache-centric approach adopted by existing HTM implementations raises a crucial problem when these are used in conjunction with NVM: since CPU caches are volatile, existing HTM fail to guarantee that data updated by committed transactions are atomically persisted to NVM.  
 I will overview how this problem has been so far tackled in the literature, with a focus on solutions that do not assume ad-hoc hard- ware mechanisms not provided by current HTM implementations, but that rather rely on hardware-software co-design techniques to ensure consistency on unmodified existing HTM systems. I will conclude by presenting ongoing research directions that depart from state of the art approaches in a twofold way: i) they assume the availability of durable caches, i.e., systems equipped with addi- tional power sources that ensure that cache contents can be safely persisted to NVM upon crashes; ii) they assume a weaker isolation levels at the TM level, namely Snapshot Isolation, which despite being more relaxed than the reference consistency model for TM systems (e.g., opacity), can still ensure correct execution of a wide range of applications while enabling new optimizations to boost the efficiency HTM applications operating on NVM.  

 From UML/MARTE Specifications to ESL HW/SW Co-Design: Early Functional Verification and Timing Validation   
 Vittorio Cortellessa 
  Luigi Pomante 
  Vincenzo Stoico 
  The continuous adoption of embedded systems in the most diverse application domains contributes to the increasing complexity of their development. Hardware/Software Co-Design methodologies are usually employed to tackle the challenges deriving from even more stringent functional and non-functional requirements. Using these methodologies, several validation and verification steps can be carried out early in the design process using a unified, technology-independent system model.  
 This work investigates the possibility of integrating formal functional verification and timing validation in a Hardware/Software Co-Design flow at the system-level of abstraction. Specifically, we introduce Co-V&V, namely an additional step that consists of two phases: (i) a transformation from UML/MARTE to UPPAAL Timed Automata, and (ii) a preliminary functional verification and timing validation that exploits the UPPAAL verifier.  
 We describe the Co-V&V step through a case study characterized by a component-based architecture and reactive behavior. The verification and validation conducted with UPPAAL indicate that our approach is particularly effective in discovering design flaws located in the communication protocol as well as those arising from the internal behavior of components.  

 Towards Solving the Challenge of Minimal Overhead Monitoring   
 David Georg Reichelt 
  Stefan Kühne 
  Wilhelm Hasselbring 
  The examination of performance changes or the performance behavior of a software requires the measurement of the performance. This is done via probes, i.e., pieces of code which obtain and process measurement data, and which are inserted into the examined application. The execution of those probes in a singular method creates overhead, which deteriorates performance measurements of calling methods and slows down the measurement process. Therefore, an important challenge for performance measurement is the reduction of the measurement overhead.  
 To address this challenge, the overhead should be minimized. Based on an analysis of the sources of performance overhead, we derive the following four optimization options: (1) Source instrumentation instead of AspectJ instrumentation, (2) reduction of measurement data, (3) change of the queue and (4) aggregation of measurement data. We evaluate the effect of these optimization options using the MooBench benchmark. Thereby, we show that these optimizations options reduce the monitoring overhead of the monitoring framework Kieker. For MooBench, the execution duration could be reduced from 4.77 µs to 0.39 µs per method invocation on average.  

 Heuristic Derivation of a Fluid Model from a Layered Queueing Network   
 Murray Woodside 
  Fluid approximations are useful for representing transient behaviour of queueing systems. For layered queues a fluid model has previously been derived indirectly via transformation first to a PEPA model, or via recursive neural networks. This paper presents a derivation directly from the layered queueing mechanisms, starting from a transformation to a context-sensitive layered form. The accuracy of predictions, compared to transient simulations and steady-state solutions, is evaluated and appears to be useful.  

 dqualizer: Domain-Centric Runtime Quality Analysis of Business-Critical Application Systems   
 Sebastian Frank 
  Julian Brott 
  Dominik Kesim 
  Heiko Holz 
  Matthias Eschhold 
  André van Hoorn 
  The runtime quality of application systems - e.g., performance, reliability, and resilience - directly influences companies' business success. Over the last few years, corresponding analysis measures such as load tests or monitoring have become widespread in practice, and mature commercial and open-source tools have been developed. However, these measures are all at the technical level and not interpreted at the (business) domain level. At the same time, software architecture and software development approaches such as Domain-Driven Design (DDD), which are becoming increasingly widespread, essentially do not consider runtime quality concerns despite their criticality.  
 Our envisioned dqualizer approach aims to close the gap between the domain-specificity of application systems and the (technical) measures and findings of quality assurance utilizing a domain-centric approach. For this purpose, we integrate means to model and monitor runtime quality metrics into DDD-based techniques, e.g., Domain Story Telling, that enable domain experts to describe domain-centric runtime quality concerns. Our preliminary results comprise the prototypical extension of a domain story editor for specifying load and resilience tests and reporting test results. Using the editor, we gathered feedback from domain experts in a qualitative user study. Despite the editor's limitations regarding functionality and usability, the feedback indicated that domain experts are able to model runtime quality analyses.

 Fast Practical Lattice Reduction Through Iterated Compression  
  Abstract   
 We introduce a new lattice basis reduction algorithm with approximation guarantees analogous to the LLL algorithm and practical performance that far exceeds the current state of the art. We achieve these results by iteratively applying precision management techniques within a recursive algorithm structure and show the stability of this approach. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of our algorithm, and show that the heuristic running time is \(O(n^{\omega }(C+n)^{1+\varepsilon })\)  for lattices of dimension n  , \(\omega \in (2,3]\)  bounding the cost of size reduction, matrix multiplication, and QR factorization, and C  bounding the log of the condition number of the input basis B  . This yields a running time of \(O\left( n^\omega (p + n)^{1 + \varepsilon }\right) \)  for precision \(p = O(\log \Vert B\Vert _{max})\)  in common applications. Our algorithm is fully practical, and we have published our implementation. We experimentally validate our heuristic, give extensive benchmarks against numerous classes of cryptographic lattices, and show that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing implementations.

 Does the Dual-Sieve Attack on Learning with Errors Even Work?  
  Abstract   
 Guo and Johansson (ASIACRYPT 2021), and MATZOV (tech. report 2022) have independently claimed improved attacks against various NIST lattice candidates by adding a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) trick on top of the so-called Dual-Sieve attack. Recently, there was more follow up work in this line adding new practical improvements.   
 However, from a theoretical perspective, all of these works are painfully specific to Learning with Errors, while the principle of the Dual-Sieve attack is more general (Laarhoven & Walter, CT-RSA 2021). More critically, all of these works are based on heuristics that have received very little theoretical and experimental attention.   
 This work attempts to rectify the above deficiencies of the literature. We first propose a generalization of the FFT trick by Guo and Johansson to arbitrary Bounded Distance Decoding instances. This generalization offers a new improvement to the attack.   
 We then theoretically explore the underlying heuristics and show that these are in contradiction with formal, unconditional theorems in some regimes, and with well-tested heuristics in other regimes. The specific instantiations of the recent literature fall into this second regime.   
 We confirm these contradictions with experiments, documenting several phenomena that are not predicted by the analysis, including a “waterfall-floor” phenomenon, reminiscent of Low-Density Parity-Check decoding failures.   
 We conclude that the success probability of the recent Dual-Sieve-FFT attacks are presumably significantly overestimated. We further discuss the adequate way forward towards fixing the attack and its analysis.

 Exploring Decryption Failures of BIKE: New Class of Weak Keys and Key Recovery Attacks  
  Abstract   
 Code-based cryptography has received a lot of attention recently because it is considered secure under quantum computing. Among them, the QC-MDPC based scheme is one of the most promising due to its excellent performance. QC-MDPC based schemes are usually subject to a small rate of decryption failure, which can leak information about the secret key. This raises two crucial problems: how to accurately estimate the decryption failure rate and how to use the failure information to recover the secret key. However, the two problems are challenging due to the difficulty of geometrically characterizing the bit-flipping decoder employed in QC-MDPC, such as using decoding radius.   
 In this work, we introduce the gathering property and show it is strongly connected with the decryption failure rate of QC-MDPC. Based on this property, we present two results for QC-MDPC based schemes. The first is a new construction of weak keys obtained by extending the keys that have gathering property via ring isomorphism. For the set of weak keys, we present a rigorous analysis of the probability, as well as experimental simulation of the decryption failure rates. Considering BIKE’s parameter set targeting 128-bit security, our result eventually indicates that the average decryption failure rate is lower bounded by \(\text {DFR}_{\text {avg}} \ge 2^{-116.61}\)  . The second entails two key recovery attacks against CCA secure QC-MDPC schemes using decryption failures in a multi-target setting. The two attacks consider whether or not it is allowed to reuse ciphertexts respectively. In both cases, we show the decryption failures can be used to identify whether a target’s secret key satisfies the gathering property. Then using the gathering property as an extra information, we present a modified information set decoding algorithm that efficiently retrieves the target’s secret key. For BIKE’s parameter set targeting 128-bit security, we show a key recovery attack with complexity \(2^{116.61}\)  can be mounted if ciphertexts reusing is not permitted, and the complexity can be reduced to \(2^{98.77}\)  when ciphertexts reusing is permitted.

 Graph-Theoretic Algorithms for the Alternating Trilinear Form Equivalence Problem  
  Abstract   
 At Eurocrypt’22 Tang, Duong, Joux, Plantard, Qiao, and Susilo proposed a digital signature algorithm based on the hardness of the isomorphism problem of alternating trilinear forms. They propose three concrete parameters in dimensions 9, 10, and 11 respectively. We give new heuristic algorithms that solve this problem more efficiently. With our new algorithms, the first parameter set can be broken in less than a day on a laptop. For the second parameter set, we show there is a \(2^{-17}\)  fraction of the public keys that can also be broken in less than a day. We do not break the third parameter set in practice, but we claim it falls short of the target security level of 128 bits.

 Analysis of the Security of the PSSI Problem and Cryptanalysis of the Durandal Signature Scheme  
  Abstract   
 We present a new attack against the PSSI problem, one of the three problems at the root of security of Durandal, an efficient rank metric code-based signature scheme with a public key size of 15 kB and a signature size of 4 kB, presented at EUROCRYPT’19. Our attack recovers the private key using a leakage of information coming from several signatures produced with the same key. Our approach is to combine pairs of signatures and perform Cramer-like formulas in order to build subspaces containing a secret element. We break all existing parameters of Durandal: the two published sets of parameters claiming a security of 128 bits are broken in respectively \(2^{66}\)  and \(2^{73}\)  elementary bit operations, and the number of signatures required to finalize the attack is 1,792 and 4,096 respectively. We implemented our attack and ran experiments that demonstrated its success with smaller parameters.

 Finding Short Integer Solutions When the Modulus Is Small  
  Abstract   
 We present cryptanalysis of the inhomogenous short integer solution ( \(\textsf{ISIS}_{}\)  ) problem for anomalously small moduli \(q\)  by exploiting the geometry of BKZ reduced bases of q  -ary lattices.   
 We apply this cryptanalysis to examples from the literature where taking such small moduli has been suggested. A recent work [Espitau–Tibouchi–Wallet–Yu, CRYPTO 2022] suggests small \(q\)  versions of the lattice signature scheme Falcon  and its variant Mitaka  . For one small \(q\)  parametrisation of Falcon  we reduce the estimated security against signature forgery by approximately 26 bits. For one small \(q\)  parametrisation of Mitaka  we successfully forge a signature in 15 s.

 Practical-Time Related-Key Attack on GOST with Secret S-Boxes  
  Abstract   
 The block cipher GOST 28147-89 was the Russian Federation encryption standard for over 20 years, and is still one of its two standard block ciphers. GOST is a 32-round Feistel construction, whose security benefits from the fact that the S-boxes used in the design are kept secret. In the last 10 years, several attacks on the full 32-round GOST were presented. However, they all assume that the S-boxes are known. When the S-boxes are secret, all published attacks either target a small number of rounds, or apply for small sets of weak keys.   
 In this paper we present the first practical-time attack on GOST with secret S-boxes. The attack works in the related-key model and is faster than all previous attacks in this model which assume that the S-boxes are known. The complexity of the attack is less than \(2^{27}\)  encryptions. It was fully verified, and runs in a few seconds on a PC. The attack is based on a novel type of related-key differentials of GOST, inspired by local collisions.   
 Our new technique may be applicable to certain GOST-based hash functions as well. To demonstrate this, we show how to find a collision on a Davies-Meyer construction based on GOST with an arbitrary initial value, in less than \(2^{10}\)  hash function evaluations.

 On Perfect Linear Approximations and Differentials over Two-Round SPNs  
  Abstract   
 Recent constructions of (tweakable) block ciphers with an embedded cryptographic backdoor relied on the existence of probability-one differentials or perfect (non-)linear approximations over a reduced-round version of the primitive. In this work, we study how the existence of probability-one differentials or perfect linear approximations over two rounds of a substitution-permutation network can be avoided by design. More precisely, we develop criteria on the s-box and the linear layer that guarantee the absence of probability-one differentials for all keys. We further present an algorithm that allows to efficiently exclude the existence of keys for which there exists a perfect linear approximation.

 Differential Meet-In-The-Middle Cryptanalysis  
  Abstract   
 In this paper we introduce the differential meet-in-the-middle framework, a new cryptanalysis technique for symmetric primitives. Our new cryptanalysis method combines techniques from both meet-in-the-middle and differential cryptanalysis. As such, the introduced technique can be seen as a way of extending meet-in-the-middle attacks and their variants but also as a new way to perform the key recovery part in differential attacks. We apply our approach to SKINNY-128-384  in the single-key model and to AES-256  in the related-key model. Our attack on SKINNY-128-384  permits to break 25 out of the 56 rounds of this variant and improves by two rounds the previous best known attacks. For AES-256  we attack 12 rounds by considering two related keys, thus outperforming the previous best related-key attack on AES-256  with only two related keys by 2 rounds.

 Moving a Step of ChaCha in Syncopated Rhythm  
  Abstract   
 The stream cipher ChaCha is one of the most widely used ciphers in the real world, such as in TLS, SSH and so on. In this paper, we study the security of ChaCha via differential cryptanalysis based on probabilistic neutrality bits (PNBs). We introduce the syncopation  technique for the PNB-based approximation in the backward direction, which significantly amplifies its correlation by utilizing the property of ARX structure. In virtue of this technique, we present a new and efficient method for finding a good set of PNBs. A refined framework of key-recovery attack is then formalized for round-reduced ChaCha. The new techniques allow us to break 7.5 rounds of ChaCha without the last XOR and rotation, as well as to bring faster attacks on 6 rounds and 7 rounds of ChaCha.

 Cryptanalysis of Symmetric Primitives over Rings and a Key Recovery Attack on Rubato  
  Abstract   
 Symmetric primitives are a cornerstone of cryptography, and have traditionally been defined over fields, where cryptanalysis is now well understood. However, a few symmetric primitives defined over rings  \(\mathbb Z _q\)  for a composite number \(q\)  have recently been proposed, a setting where security is much less studied. In this paper we focus on studying established algebraic attacks typically defined over fields and the extent of their applicability to symmetric primitives defined over the ring of integers modulo a composite \(q\)  . Based on our analysis, we present an attack on full Rubato  , a family of symmetric ciphers proposed by Ha et al. at Eurocrypt 2022 designed to be used in a transciphering framework for approximate fully homomorphic encryption. We show that at least 25 \(\%\)  of the possible choices for \(q\)  satisfy certain conditions that lead to a successful key recovery attack with complexity significantly lower than the claimed security level for five of the six ciphers in the Rubato  family.

 Prouff and Rivain’s Formal Security Proof of Masking, Revisited  
  Tight Bounds in the Noisy Leakage Model   
 Abstract   
 Masking is a counter-measure that can be incorporated to software and hardware implementations of block ciphers to provably secure them against side-channel attacks. The security of masking can be proven in different types of threat models. In this paper, we are interested in directly proving the security in the most realistic threat model, the so-called noisy leakage  adversary, that captures well how real-world side-channel adversaries operate. Direct proofs in this leakage model have been established by Prouff & Rivain at Eurocrypt 2013  , Dziembowski et al.  at Eurocrypt 2015  , and Prest et al.  at Crypto 2019  . These proofs are complementary to each other, in the sense that the weaknesses of one proof are fixed in at least one of the others, and conversely. These weaknesses concerned in particular the strong requirements on the noise level and the security parameter to get meaningful security bounds, and some requirements on the type of adversary covered by the proof— i.e.  , chosen or random plaintexts. This suggested that the drawbacks of each security bound could actually be proof artifacts. In this paper, we solve both issues, by revisiting Prouff & Rivain’s approach.

 Combined Fault and Leakage Resilience: Composability, Constructions and Compiler  
  Abstract   
 Real-world cryptographic implementations nowadays are not only attacked via classical cryptanalysis but also via implementation attacks, including passive attacks (observing side-channel information about the inner computation) and active attacks (inserting faults into the computation). While countermeasures exist for each type of attack, countermeasures against combined attacks have only been considered recently. Masking is a standard technique for protecting against passive side-channel attacks, but protecting against active attacks with additive masking is challenging. Previous approaches include running multiple copies of a masked computation, requiring a large amount of randomness or being vulnerable to horizontal attacks. An alternative approach is polynomial masking, which is inherently fault-resistant.   
 This work presents a compiler based on polynomial masking that achieves linear computational complexity for affine functions and cubic complexity for non-linear functions. The resulting compiler is secure against attackers using region probes and adaptive faults. In addition, the notion of fault-invariance is introduced to improve security against combined attacks without the need to consider all possible fault combinations. Our approach has the best-known asymptotic efficiency among all known approaches.

 Learning with Physical Rounding for Linear and Quadratic Leakage Functions  
  Abstract   
 Fresh re-keying is a countermeasure against side-channel analysis where an ephemeral key is derived from a long-term key using a public random value. Popular instances of such schemes rely on key-homomorphic primitives, so that the re-keying process is easy to mask and the rest of the (e.g., block cipher) computations can run with cheaper countermeasures. The main requirement for these schemes to be secure is that the leakages of the ephemeral keys do not allow recovering the long-term key. The Learning with Physical Rounding (LWPR) problem formalizes this security in a practically-relevant model where the adversary can observe noise-free leakages. It can be viewed as a physical version of the Learning With Rounding (LWR) problem, where the rounding is performed by a leakage function and therefore does not have to be computed explicitly. In this paper, we first consolidate the intuition that LWPR cannot be secure in a serial implementation context without additional countermeasures (like shuffling), due to attacks exploiting worst-case leakages that can be mounted with practical data complexity. We then extend the understanding of LWPR in a parallel implementation setting. On the one hand, we generalize its robustness against cryptanalysis taking advantage of any (i.e., not only worst-case) leakage. A previous work claimed security in the specific context of a Hamming weight leakage function. We clarify necessary conditions to maintain this guarantee, based on the degree of the leakage function and the accuracy of its coefficients. On the other hand, we show that parallelism inherently provides good security against attacks exploiting worst-case leakages. We finally confirm the practical relevance of these findings by validating our assumptions experimentally for an exemplary implementation.

 Unifying Freedom and Separation for Tight Probing-Secure Composition  
  Abstract   
 The masking countermeasure is often analyzed in the probing model. Proving the probing security of large circuits at high masking orders is achieved by composing gadgets that satisfy security definitions such as non-interference (NI), strong non-interference (SNI) or free SNI. The region probing model is a variant of the probing model, where the probing capabilities of the adversary scale with the number of regions in a masked circuit. This model is of interest as it allows better reductions to the more realistic noisy leakage model. The efficiency of composable region probing secure masking has been recently improved with the introduction of the input-output separation (IOS) definition.   
 In this paper, we first establish equivalences between the non-interference framework and the IOS formalism. We also generalize the security definitions to multiple-input gadgets and systematically show implications and separations between these notions. Then, we study which gadgets from the literature satisfy these. We give new security proofs for some well-known arbitrary-order gadgets, and also some automated proofs for fixed-order, special-case gadgets. To this end, we introduce a new automated formal verification algorithm that solves the open problem of verifying free SNI, which is not a purely simulation-based definition. Using the relationships between the security notions, we adapt this algorithm to further verify IOS. Finally, we look at composition theorems. In the probing model, we use the link between free SNI and the IOS formalism to generalize and improve the efficiency of the tight private circuit (Asiacrypt 2018) construction, also fixing a flaw in the original proof. In the region probing model, we relax the assumptions for IOS composition (TCHES 2021), which allows to save many refresh gadgets, hence improving the efficiency.

While these mixing layers have a bitwise differential branch number of 4 and a computational cost of 2 (bitwise) additions per bit, the circulant twin CPMs we build have a bitwise differential branch number of 12 at the expense of an increase in computational cost: depending on the dimension this ranges between 3 and 3.34 XORs per bit. Our circulant twin CPMs operate on a state in the form of a rectangular array and can serve as mixing layer in a round function that has as non-linear step a layer of S-boxes operating in parallel on the columns. When sandwiched between two ShiftRow-like mappings, we can obtain a columnwise branch number of 12 and hence it guarantees 12 active S-boxes per two rounds in differential trails. Remarkably, the linear branch numbers (bitwise and columnwise alike) of these mappings is only 4. However, we define the transpose  of a circulant twin CPM that has linear branch number of 12 and a differential branch number of 4. We give a concrete instantiation of a permutation using such a mixing layer, named Gaston  . It operates on a state of \(5 \times 64\)  bits and uses \(\chi \)  operating on columns for its non-linear layer. Most notably, the Gaston  round function is lightweight in that it takes as few bitwise operations as the one of NIST lightweight standard Ascon  . We show that the best 3-round differential and linear trails of Gaston  have much higher weights than those of Ascon  . Permutations like Gaston  can be very competitive in applications that rely for their security exclusively on good differential properties, such as keyed hashing as in the compression phase of Farfalle.

 New Design Techniques for Efficient Arithmetization-Oriented Hash Functions: Permutations and Compression Mode  
  Abstract   
 Advanced cryptographic protocols such as Zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs of knowledge, widely used in cryptocurrency applications such as Zcash, Monero, Filecoin, Tezos, Topos, demand new cryptographic hash functions that are efficient not only over the binary field \(\mathbb {F}_2\)  , but also over large fields of prime characteristic \(\mathbb {F}_p\)  . This need has been acknowledged by the wider community and new so-called Arithmetization-Oriented  (AO) hash functions have been proposed, e.g. MiMC-Hash, Rescue–Prime, Poseidon  , Reinforced Concrete  and Griffin  to name a few.   
 In this paper we propose Anemoi  : a new family of ZK-friendly permutations, that can be used to construct efficient hash functions and compression functions. The main features of these algorithms are that 1) they are designed to be efficient within multiple proof systems (e.g. Groth16, Plonk  , etc.), 2) they contain dedicated functions optimised for specific applications (namely Merkle tree hashing and general purpose hashing), 3) they have highly competitive performance e.g. about a factor of 2 improvement over Poseidon  and Rescue–Prime in terms of R1CS  constraints, a 21%–35% Plonk  constraint reduction over a highly optimized Poseidon  implementation, as well as competitive native performance, running between two and three times faster than Rescue–Prime, depending on the field size.   
 On the theoretical side, Anemoi  pushes further the frontier in understanding the design principles that are truly entailed by arithmetization-orientation. In particular, we identify and exploit a previously unknown relationship between CCZ-equivalence and arithmetization-orientation. In addition, we propose two new standalone components that can be easily reused in new designs. One is a new S-box called Flystel  , based on the well-studied butterfly structure, and the second is \(\textsf{Jive}_{}\)  – a new mode of operation, inspired by the “Latin dance” symmetric algorithms (Salsa, ChaCha and derivatives). Our design is a conservative one: it uses a very classical Substitution-Permutation Network structure, and our detailed analysis of algebraic attacks highlights can be of independent interest.

 Coefficient Grouping for Complex Affine Layers  
  Abstract   
 Designing symmetric-key primitives for applications in Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) has become important to address the issue of the ciphertext expansion. In such a context, cryptographic primitives with a low-AND-depth decryption circuit are desired. Consequently, quadratic nonlinear functions are commonly used in these primitives, including the well-known \(\chi \)  function over \(\mathbb {F}_2^n\)  and the power map over a large finite field \(\mathbb {F}_{p^n}\)  . In this work, we study the growth of the algebraic degree for an SPN cipher over \(\mathbb {F}_{2^n}^{m}\)  , whose S-box is defined as the combination of a power map \(x\mapsto x^{2^d+1}\)  and an \(\mathbb {F}_2\)  -linearized affine polynomial \(x\mapsto c_0+\sum _{i=1}^{w}c_ix^{2^{h_i}}\)  where \(c_1,\ldots ,c_w\ne 0\)  . Specifically, motivated by the fact that the original coefficient grouping technique published at EUROCRYPT 2023 becomes less efficient for \(w>1\)  , we develop a variant technique that can efficiently work for arbitrary w  . With this new technique to study the upper bound of the algebraic degree, we answer the following questions from a theoretic perspective: 1.  can the algebraic degree increase exponentially when \(w=1\)  ?   

 2.  what is the influence of w  , d  and \((h_1,\ldots ,h_w)\)  on the growth of the algebraic degree?   

 Based on this, we show (i) how to efficiently find \((h_1,\ldots ,h_w)\)  to achieve the exponential growth of the algebraic degree and (ii) how to efficiently compute the upper bound of the algebraic degree for arbitrary \((h_1,\ldots ,h_w)\)  . Therefore, we expect that these results can further advance the understanding of the design and analysis of such primitives.

 Horst Meets Fluid-SPN: Griffin for Zero-Knowledge Applications  
  Abstract   
 Zero-knowledge (ZK) applications form a large group of use cases in modern cryptography, and recently gained in popularity due to novel proof systems. For many of these applications, cryptographic hash functions are used as the main building blocks, and they often dominate the overall performance and cost of these approaches.   
 Therefore, in the last years several new hash functions were built in order to reduce the cost in these scenarios, including Poseidon  and Rescue  among others. These hash functions often look very different from more classical designs such as AES or SHA-2. For example, they work natively over prime fields rather than binary ones. At the same time, for example Poseidon  and Rescue  share some common features, such as being SPN schemes and instantiating the nonlinear layer with invertible power maps. While this allows the designers to provide simple and strong arguments for establishing their security, it also introduces crucial limitations in the design, which may affect the performance in the target applications.   
 In this paper, we propose the Horst  construction, in which the addition in a Feistel scheme \((x,y)\mapsto (y+F(x), x)\)  is extended via a multiplication, i.e., \((x,y)\mapsto (y\times G(x) + F(x), x)\)  .   
 By carefully analyzing the performance metrics in SNARK and STARK protocols, we show how to combine an expanding Horst  scheme with a Rescue  -like SPN scheme in order to provide security and better efficiency in the target applications. We provide an extensive security analysis for our new design Griffin  and a comparison with all current competitors.

 On the Security of Keyed Hashing Based on Public Permutations  
  Abstract   
 Doubly-extendable cryptographic keyed functions (deck) generalize the concept of message authentication codes (MAC) and stream ciphers in that they support variable-length strings as input and return variable-length strings as output. A prominent example of building deck functions is Farfalle, which consists of a set of public permutations and rolling functions that are used in its compression and expansion layers. By generalizing the compression layer of Farfalle, we prove its universality in terms of the probability of differentials over the public permutation used in it. As the compression layer of Farfalle is inherently parallel, we compare it to a generalization of a serial compression function inspired by Pelican-MAC. The same public permutation may result in different universalities depending on whether the compression is done in parallel or serial. The parallel construction consistently performs better than the serial one, sometimes by a big factor. We demonstrate this effect using Xoodoo  \([3]\)  , which is a round-reduced variant of the public permutation used in the deck function Xoofff.

 Revisiting the Indifferentiability of the Sum of Permutations  
  Abstract   
 The sum of two n  -bit pseudorandom permutations is known to behave like a pseudorandom function with n  bits of security. A recent line of research has investigated the security of two public n  -bit permutations and its degree of indifferentiability. Mandal et al. (INDOCRYPT 2010) proved 2 n  /3-bit security, Mennink and Preneel (ACNS 2015) pointed out a non-trivial flaw in their analysis and re-proved \((2n/3-\log _2(n))\)  -bit security. Bhattacharya and Nandi (EUROCRYPT 2018) eventually improved the result to n  -bit security. Recently, Gunsing at CRYPTO 2022 already observed that a proof technique used in this line of research only holds for sequential indifferentiability. We revisit the line of research in detail, and observe that the strongest bound of n  -bit security has two other serious issues in the reasoning, the first one is actually the same non-trivial flaw that was present in the work of Mandal et al., while the second one discards biases in the randomness influenced by the distinguisher. More concretely, we introduce two attacks that show limited potential of different approaches. We (i) show that the latter issue that discards biases only holds up to \(2^{3n/4}\)  queries, and (ii) perform a differentiability attack against their simulator in \(2^{5n/6}\)  queries. On the upside, we revive the result of Mennink and Preneel and show \((2n/3-\log _2(n))\)  -bit regular indifferentiability security of the sum of public permutations.

 When Messages Are Keys: Is HMAC a Dual-PRF?  
  Abstract   
 In Internet security protocols including TLS 1.3, KEMTLS, MLS and Noise, \(\textsf{HMAC}\)  is being assumed to be a dual-PRF, meaning a PRF not only when keyed conventionally (through its first input), but also when “swapped” and keyed (unconventionally) through its second (message) input. We give the first in-depth analysis of the dual-PRF assumption on \(\textsf{HMAC}\)  . For the swap case, we note that security does not hold in general, but completely characterize when it does; we show that \(\textsf{HMAC}\)  is swap-PRF secure if and only if keys are restricted to sets satisfying a condition called feasibility, that we give, and that holds in applications. The sufficiency is shown by proof and the necessity by attacks. For the conventional PRF case, we fill a gap in the literature by proving PRF security of \(\textsf{HMAC}\)  for keys of arbitrary length. Our proofs are in the standard model, make assumptions only on the compression function underlying the hash function, and give good bounds in the multi-user setting. The positive results are strengthened through achieving a new notion of variable key-length PRF security that guarantees security even if different users use keys of different lengths, as happens in practice.

 Layout Graphs, Random Walks and the t-Wise Independence of SPN Block Ciphers  
  Abstract   
 We continue the study of t  -wise independence of substitution-permutation networks (SPNs) initiated by the recent work of Liu, Tessaro, and Vaikuntanathan (CRYPTO 2021).   
 Our key technical result shows that when the S-boxes are randomly and independently chosen  and kept secret, an r  -round SPN with input length \(n = b \cdot k\)  is \(2^{-\varTheta (n)}\)  -close to t  -wise independent within \(r = O(\min \{k, \log t\})\)  rounds for any t  almost as large as \(2^{b/2}\)  . Here, b  is the input length of the S-box and we assume that the underlying mixing achieves maximum branch number. We also analyze the special case of AES parameters (with random S-boxes), and show it is \(2^{-128}\)  -close to pairwise independent in 7 rounds. Central to our result is the analysis of a random walk on what we call the layout graph  , a combinatorial abstraction that captures equality and inequality constraints among multiple SPN evaluations.   
 We use our technical result to show concrete security bounds for SPNs with actual block cipher parameters and small-input  S  -boxes  . (This is in contrast to the large body of results on ideal-model analyses of SPNs.) For example, for the censored-AES block cipher, namely AES with most of the mixing layers removed, we show that 192 rounds suffice to attain \(2^{-128}\)  -closeness to pairwise independence. The prior such result for AES (Liu, Tessaro and Vaikuntanathan, CRYPTO 2021) required more than 9000 rounds.

 : Isogeny-Based (Partially) Blind Signatures from the Class Group Action with a Twist  
  Abstract   
 In this paper, we construct the first provably-secure isogeny-based (partially) blind signature scheme. While at a high level the scheme resembles the Schnorr blind signature, our work does not directly follow from that construction, since isogenies do not offer as rich an algebraic structure. Specifically, our protocol does not fit into the linear identification protocol  abstraction introduced by Hauck, Kiltz, and Loss (EUROCYRPT’19), which was used to generically construct Schnorr-like blind signatures based on modules such as classical groups and lattices. Consequently, our scheme does not seem susceptible to the recent efficient ROS attack exploiting the linear nature of the underlying mathematical tool.   
 In more detail, our blind signature exploits the quadratic twist  of an elliptic curve in an essential way to endow isogenies with a strictly richer structure than abstract group actions (but still more restrictive than modules). The basic scheme has public key size 128 B and signature size 8 KB under the CSIDH-512 parameter sets—these are the smallest among all provably secure post-quantum secure blind signatures. Relying on a new ring  variant of the group action inverse problem ( \(\textsf{rGAIP}\)  ), we can halve the signature size to 4 KB while increasing the public key size to 512 B. We provide preliminary cryptanalysis of \({\textsf{rGAIP}} \)  and show that for certain parameter settings, it is essentially as secure as the standard \(\textsf{GAIP}\)  . Finally, we show a novel way to turn our blind signature into a partially blind signature, where we deviate from prior methods since they require hashing into the set of public keys while hiding the corresponding secret key—constructing such a hash function in the isogeny setting remains an open problem.

 Weak Instances of Class Group Action Based Cryptography via Self-pairings  
  Abstract   
 In this paper we study non-trivial self-pairings with cyclic domains that are compatible with isogenies between elliptic curves oriented by an imaginary quadratic order \(\mathcal {O}\)  . We prove that the order m  of such a self-pairing necessarily satisfies \(m \mid \varDelta _\mathcal {O}\)  (and even \(2m \mid \varDelta _\mathcal {O}\)  if \(4 \mid \varDelta _\mathcal {O}\)  and \(4m \mid \varDelta _\mathcal {O}\)  if \(8 \mid \varDelta _\mathcal {O}\)  ) and is not a multiple of the field characteristic. Conversely, for each m  satisfying these necessary conditions, we construct a family of non-trivial cyclic self-pairings of order m  that are compatible with oriented isogenies, based on generalized Weil and Tate pairings.   
 As an application, we identify weak instances of class group actions on elliptic curves assuming the degree of the secret isogeny is known. More in detail, we show that if \(m^2 \mid \varDelta _\mathcal {O}\)  for some prime power m  then given two primitively \(\mathcal {O}\)  -oriented elliptic curves \((E, \iota )\)  and \((E',\iota ') = [\mathfrak {a}](E,\iota )\)  connected by an unknown invertible ideal \(\mathfrak {a}\subseteq \mathcal {O}\)  , we can recover \(\mathfrak {a}\)  essentially at the cost of a discrete logarithm computation in a group of order \(m^2\)  , assuming the norm of \(\mathfrak {a}\)  is given and is smaller than \(m^2\)  . We give concrete instances, involving ordinary elliptic curves over finite fields, where this turns into a polynomial time attack.   
 Finally, we show that these self-pairings simplify known results on the decisional Diffie–Hellman problem for class group actions on oriented elliptic curves.

  Invited speakers  
  Wesley Holliday      
   
 Wesley H. Holliday is Professor of Philosophy and Chair of the Group in Logic and the Methodology of Science at the University of California, Berkeley. He earned his PhD from Stanford University in 2012, working under the supervision of Johan van Benthem and Krista Lawlor. His dissertation on epistemic logic won the E. W. Beth Dissertation Prize in 2013. At Berkeley he has worked mainly on modal and nonclassical logic, logic and natural language, logic and probability, and logic and social choice theory. Some of his papers on modal logic have appeared in AiML 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2020.  
   
  Invited talk AiML 2022 :   
  Non-classical modal logic for natural language   

  Francesca Poggiolesi      
   
 I obtained my PhD in Philosophy from the University of Florence, Italy and the University of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, France. Before joining the IHPST UMR 8590, CNRS, where I have been a permanent member since 2015, I have held research and teaching positions at the VUB, Belgium and Aix-Marseille University. I have been actively working on the proof theory for modal logic for almost ten years. More recently I have moved my interests to more philosophical notions such as grounding or explanations; I use the techniques of proof theory to attempt to provide a rigorous account of these concepts.  
   
  Invited talk AiML 2022 :   
  Explanations in Logic   

  Willem Conradie      
   
 Willem Conradie is a professor in the School of Mathematics at the  
  University of the Witwatersrand (WITS), South Africa, where is also Assistant Dean for Teaching and Learning in the Faculty of Science. Previously he was an associate professor and head of department at the University of Johannesburg. After completing the Master of Logic programme at the ILLC in 2002, he received a PhD in Mathematics from WITS in 2007 under the supervision of Valentin Goranko. His main research interests are in non-classical logics and their applications, on which he publishes regularly, with some recent contributions addressing the correspondence theory for non-distributive modal logics, new polarity and graph-based semantic for non-distributive modal logics suitable for interpretations of these formalisms as logics of categorisation systems or as hyper-constructivists logics of informational entropy and evidential reasoning, as well as new algebraic semantics for hybrid logics. Conradie has co-authored the book “Logic and Discrete Mathematics: A Concise Introduction” published by Wiley UK. He serves on the council of the South African Mathematical Society, the council of the Association for Symbolic Logic and on the South African Mathematics Olympiad committee.  
   
  Invited talk AiML 2022 :   
  On parametric phenomena in correspondence theory   

  Rineke Verbrugge      
   
 Rineke Verbrugge is a pioneer in building bridges between logic and cognitive science. She holds the chair of Logic and Cognition at the University of Groningen’s Bernoulli Institute of Mathematics, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. Verbrugge’s research spans an area covering provability logic, teamwork in multi-agent environments, and social cognition. Since her PhD on logic and the foundations of mathematics at the University of Amsterdam in 1993, Verbrugge has published more than 170 peer-reviewed international publications and a monograph, Teamwork in Multi-Agent Systems, with Barbara Dunin-Kęplicz. Verbrugge has led the NWO Vici-project “Cognitive systems in interaction: Logical and computational models of higher-order social cognition”. She is one of the six principal investigators of the Gravitation project “Hybrid Intelligence: Augmenting Human Intellect” that runs in the Netherlands in 2020-2030. Verbrugge is associate editor of the Journal of Logic, Language and Information and has been program (co-)chair of several workshops and conferences, including AiML 2020 and TARK 2023, as well as chair of the Dutch Association for Logic. Since 2021, Verbrugge is an elected member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences (KNAW).

 22 - 25 August 2022, 14th International Conference on Advances in Modal Logic (AiML 2022), Rennes, France  
 Date: 22 - 25 August 2022   
 Location: Rennes, France   
 Deadline: Monday 7 March 2022   
 Advances in Modal Logic is an initiative aimed at presenting the state of the art in modal logic and its various applications. The initiative consists of a conference series together with volumes based on the conferences. AiML 2022 will be co-located with the Workshop on Logical Aspects of Multi-Agent Systems and Strategic Reasoning (LAMAS&SR 2022).  
 TOPICS  
 We invite submissions on all aspects of modal logic, including:  
 * history of modal logic  
  * philosophy of modal logic  
  * applications of modal logic  
  * computational aspects of modal logic (complexity and decidability of modal and temporal logics, modal and temporal logic programming, model checking, model generation, theorem proving for modal logics)  
  * theoretical aspects of modal logic (topological/algebraic/categorical perspectives on modal logic, coalgebraic modal logic, completeness and canonicity, correspondence and duality theory, many-dimensional modal logics, modal fixed point logics, model theory of modal logic, proof theory of modal logic)  
  * specific instances and variations of modal logic (description logics, modal logics over non-boolean bases, dynamic logics and other process logics, epistemic and deontic logics, modal logics for agent-based systems, modal logic and game theory, modal logic and grammar formalisms, provability and interpretability logics, spatial and temporal logics, hybrid logic, intuitionistic logic, substructural logics, computationally light fragments of all such logics)  
 Papers on related subjects will also be considered.  
 PAPER SUBMISSIONS  
 There will be two types of submissions for AiML 2022:  
 (1) Full papers for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference.  
 (2) Short presentations intended for presentation at the conference but not for the published proceedings.  
 Both types of papers should be submitted electronically using the EasyChair submission page which will be made available in due course.  
 At least one author of each accepted paper or short presentation must register for and attend the conference.  
 (1) FULL PAPERS  
 Authors are invited to submit, for presentation at the conference and publication in the proceedings, full papers reporting on original research and not submitted elsewhere. Information on the submission procedure will be made available in due course.  
 The submissions should be at most 15 pages, with an optional technical appendix of up to 5 pages, together with a plain-text abstract of 100-200 words. The submissions must be typeset in LaTeX, using the style files and template that will be provided on the AiML 2022 website in due time.  
 Authors must submit an abstract in plain text via EasyChair by the abstract deadline prior to full submission of their paper.  
 The presentations of accepted full papers will be 30 minutes long.  
 (2) SHORT PRESENTATIONS.  
 These should be at most 5 pages. They may describe preliminary results, work in progress etc., and will be subject to light reviewing. The accepted submissions will be made available at the conference, and the authors will have the opportunity to give short presentations (of up to 15 minutes) on them.

 The Thirty-Seventh Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023) is an interdisciplinary conference that brings together researchers in machine learning, neuroscience, statistics, optimization, computer vision, natural language processing, life sciences, natural sciences, social sciences, and other adjacent fields. We invite submissions presenting new and original research on topics including but not limited to the following:  
 Applications (e.g., vision, language, speech and audio) 
  Deep learning (e.g., architectures, generative models, optimization for deep networks) 
  Evaluation (e.g., methodology, meta studies, replicability and validity) 
  General machine learning (supervised, unsupervised, online, active, etc.) 
  Infrastructure (e.g., libraries, improved implementation and scalability, distributed solutions) 
  Machine learning for sciences (e.g. climate, health, life sciences, physics, social sciences) 
  Neuroscience and cognitive science (e.g., neural coding, brain-computer interfaces) 
  Optimization (e.g., convex and non-convex, stochastic, robust) 
  Probabilistic methods (e.g., variational inference, causal inference, Gaussian processes) 
  Reinforcement learning (e.g., decision and control, planning, hierarchical RL, robotics) 
  Social and economic aspects of machine learning (e.g., fairness, interpretability, human-AI interaction, privacy, safety, strategic behavior) 
  Theory (e.g., control theory, learning theory, algorithmic game theory) 
  Machine learning is a rapidly evolving field, and so we welcome interdisciplinary submissions that do not fit neatly into existing categories.  
 Authors are asked to confirm that their submissions accord with the       NeurIPS code of conduct        .        
 Formatting instructions:       All submissions must be in PDF format. Submissions are limited to nine content pages, including all figures and tables; additional pages containing references are allowed. You must format your submission using the       NeurIPS 2023 LaTeX style file           which includes a “preprint” option for non-anonymous preprints posted online. The maximum file size for submissions is 50MB. Submissions that violate the NeurIPS style (e.g., by decreasing margins or font sizes) or page limits may be rejected without further review. If your submission is accepted, you will be allowed an additional content page for the camera-ready version. Papers may be rejected without consideration of their merits if they fail to meet the submission requirements, as described in this document.        
 Use of Large Language Models (LLMs):  We welcome authors to use any tool that is suitable for preparing high-quality papers and research. However, we ask authors to keep in mind two important criteria. First, we expect papers to fully describe their methodology, and any tool that is important to that methodology, including the use of LLMs, should be described also. For example, authors should mention tools (including LLMs) that were used for data processing or filtering, visualization, facilitating or running experiments, and proving theorems. It may also be advisable to describe the use of LLMs in implementing the method (if this corresponds to an important, original, or non-standard component of the approach). Second, authors are responsible for the entire content of the paper, including all text and figures, so while authors are welcome to use any tool they wish for writing the paper, they must ensure that all text is correct and original.  
 Double-blind reviewing:       All submissions must be anonymized and may not contain any identifying information that may violate the double-blind reviewing policy. This policy applies to any supplementary or linked material as well, including code. If you are including links to any external material, it is your responsibility to guarantee anonymous browsing. Please do not include acknowledgements at submission time. If you need to cite one of your own papers, you should do so with adequate anonymization to preserve double-blind reviewing. For instance, write “In the previous work of Smith et al. [1]…” rather than “In our previous work [1]...”). If you need to cite one of your own papers that is in submission to NeurIPS and not available as a non-anonymous preprint, then include a copy of the cited anonymized submission in the supplementary material and write “Anonymous et al. [1] concurrently show...”).        
  OpenReview:    We are using OpenReview to manage submissions. The reviews and author responses will not be public initially (but may be made public later, see below). As in previous years, submissions under review will be visible only to their assigned program committee. We will not be soliciting comments from the general public during the reviewing process. Anyone who plans to submit a paper as an author or a co-author will need to create (or update) their OpenReview profile by the full paper submission deadline. Your OpenReview profile can be edited by logging in and clicking on your name in https://openreview.net/  . This takes you to a URL "https://openreview.net/profile?id=~[Firstname]_[Lastname][n]" where the last part is your profile name, e.g., ~Wei_Zhang1. The OpenReview profiles must be up to date, with all publications by the authors, and their current affiliations. The easiest way to import publications is through DBLP but it is not required, see FAQ  . Submissions without updated OpenReview profiles will be desk rejected. The information entered in the profile is critical for ensuring that       conflicts of interest        and reviewer matching are handled properly. Because of the rapid growth of NeurIPS, we request that all authors help with reviewing papers, if asked to do so. We need everyone’s help in maintaining the high scientific quality of NeurIPS.        
 Abstract Submission:       There is a mandatory abstract submission deadline on May 11, 2023 01:00 PM PDT, six days before full paper submissions are due. While it will be possible to edit the title and abstract until the full paper submission deadline, submissions with “placeholder” abstracts that are rewritten for the full submission risk being removed without consideration. This includes titles and abstracts that either provide little or no semantic information (e.g., "We provide a new semi-supervised learning method.") or describe a substantively different claimed contribution. The author list cannot be changed after the abstract deadline. After that, authors may be reordered, but any additions or removals must be justified in writing and approved on a case-by-case basis by the program chairs only in exceptional circumstances.        
 Supplementary material:       Authors may submit up to 100MB of supplementary material, such as appendices, proofs, derivations, data, or source code; all supplementary materials must be in PDF or ZIP format. Supplementary material should be material created by the authors that directly supports the submission content. Like submissions, supplementary material must be anonymized. Looking at supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers. The deadline for supplementary material is one week after the main paper.        
 We encourage authors to upload their code and data as part of their supplementary material in order to help reviewers assess the quality of the work. Check       the policy        as well as code submission       guidelines and templates        for further details.        
 Ethics review:       Reviewers and ACs may flag submissions for       ethics review        . Flagged submissions will be sent to an ethics review committee for comments. Comments from ethics reviewers will be considered by the primary reviewers and AC as part of their deliberation. They will also be visible to authors, who will have an opportunity to respond. Ethics reviewers do not have the authority to reject papers, but in extreme cases papers may be rejected by the program chairs on ethical grounds, regardless of scientific quality or contribution.              
 Paper checklist:       In order to improve the rigor and transparency of research submitted to and published at NeurIPS, authors are required to complete a       paper checklist        . The paper checklist is intended to help authors reflect on a wide variety of issues relating to responsible machine learning research, including reproducibility, transparency, research ethics, and societal impact. The checklist does not count towards the page limit and will be entered in OpenReview.        
 Preprints:       The existence of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv or other online repositories, personal websites, social media) will not result in rejection. If you choose to use the NeurIPS style for the preprint version, you must use the “preprint” option rather than the “final” option. Reviewers will be instructed not to actively look for such preprints, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest. Authors may submit anonymized work to NeurIPS that is already available as a preprint (e.g., on arXiv) without citing it. Note that public versions of the submission should not say       "Under review at NeurIPS" or similar.         
 Dual submissions:       Submissions that are substantially similar to papers that the authors have previously published or submitted in parallel to other peer-reviewed venues with proceedings or journals may not be submitted to NeurIPS. Papers previously presented at workshops are permitted, so long as they did not appear in a conference proceedings (e.g., CVPRW proceedings), a journal or a book. NeurIPS coordinates with other conferences to identify dual submissions. The NeurIPS policy on dual submissions applies for the entire duration of the reviewing process. Slicing contributions too thinly is discouraged. The reviewing process will treat any other submission by an overlapping set of authors as prior work. If publishing one would render the other too incremental, both may be rejected.        
 Author responses:       Authors will have one week to view and respond to initial reviews. Author responses may not contain any identifying information that may violate the double-blind reviewing policy. Authors may not submit revisions of their paper or supplemental material, but may post their responses as a discussion in OpenReview. This is to reduce the burden on authors to have to revise their paper in a rush during the short rebuttal period.        
 After the initial response period, authors will be able to respond to any further reviewer/AC questions and comments by posting on the submission’s forum page. The program chairs reserve the right to solicit additional reviews after the initial author response period. These reviews will become visible to the authors as they are added to OpenReview, and authors will have a chance to respond to them.        
 After the notification deadline, accepted and opted-in rejected papers will be made public and open for non-anonymous public commenting. Their anonymous reviews, meta-reviews, author responses and reviewer responses will also be made public. Authors of rejected papers will have two weeks after the notification deadline to opt in to make their deanonymized rejected papers public in OpenReview. These papers are not counted as NeurIPS publications and will be shown as rejected in OpenReview.        
 Publication of accepted submissions:       Reviews, meta-reviews, and any discussion with the authors will be made public for accepted papers (but reviewer, area chair, and senior area chair identities will remain anonymous). Camera-ready papers will be due in advance of the conference. All camera-ready papers must include a       funding disclosure        . We strongly encourage accompanying code and data to be submitted with accepted papers when appropriate, as per the       code submission policy        . Authors will be allowed to make minor changes for a short period of time after the conference.        
 Contemporaneous Work:       For the purpose of the reviewing process, papers that appeared online within two months of a submission will generally be considered "contemporaneous" in the sense that the submission will not be rejected on the basis of the comparison to contemporaneous work. Authors are still expected to cite and discuss contemporaneous work and perform empirical comparisons to the degree feasible. Any paper that influenced the submission is considered prior work and must be cited and discussed as such. Submissions that are very similar to contemporaneous work will undergo additional scrutiny to prevent cases of plagiarism and missing credit to prior work.        
 Plagiarism       is prohibited by the NeurIPS       Code of Conduct        .        
 Other Tracks:    Similarly to earlier years, we will host multiple tracks, such as       Datasets and Benchmarks  , Competitions  , tutorials as well as workshops, in addition to the main track for which this call for papers is intended. See the       conference homepage        for updates and calls for participation in these tracks.        
 Experiments:       As in past years, the program chairs will be measuring the quality and effectiveness of the review process via randomized controlled experiments. All experiments are independently reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB).        
 Financial        Aid        :        Each paper may designate up to one (1) NeurIPS.cc account email address of a corresponding student author who confirms that they would need the support to attend the conference, and agrees to volunteer if they get selected. To be considered for Financial the student will also need to fill out the Financial Aid application when it becomes available.

  NeurIPS 2023 FAQ for Authors  
 We will update this page as new questions arise. Please check back regularly. If you do not find an answer to your question here, you are welcome to contact the program chairs at neurips2023pcs@gmail.com  , but please make sure that you have read the call for papers  and this document first.  
 Accepted Papers  
 When is the camera-ready deadline?  See Dates https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2023/Dates 
  How do I submit the camera-ready paper?  To edit the Camera Ready file and information, go to the OpenReview page for the paper, and select Edit (top right corner) and then “Camera Ready Version”. 
  Do authors need to register for the conference?  Yes, at least one author per paper must register, see https://neurips.cc/FAQ/AuthorRegistration 
  What is the page limit for the camera ready?        You get 1 extra page, so 10 pages of content. After the 10 pages, you can include (in this order):       acknowledgements, bibliography and appendices. Do not include hard-to-read material like code, data etc. This can go into the supplementary.       IMPORTANT: Please start the appendices on a new page. There’s a possibility that we’ll need to aggregate all papers into a single proceedings file, and we’d like to keep that one without appendices. Having appendices on a new page we’ll allow us to do this automatically. 
  Do you need to include a paper checklist?        No, there was no checklist in the PDF this year, so this is not needed. 
  Can you include the appendix in the same PDF?        Yes, after the acknowledgement and references. You can also include it in the supplementary materials. 
  Can you edit the title, keywords and the abstract?        Yes, as long as they do not substantially differ from the original submission. 
  Can you edit the author list?        You can reorder the author lists freely, but you’d need special permission from the Program Chairs if you want to remove or add an author. 
  How do I upload the poster?  Please see https://neurips.cc/FAQ/PosterInformation 
  Submission process  
 Can the author list be changed?  Changes may be made to the author list until the abstract deadline. After that, authors may be reordered if/when your paper is accepted, but any additions or removals will be extremely rare and must be justified in writing and approved on a case-by-case basis by the program chairs. 
  Do my co-authors need to create an OpenReview account?  Yes. Before the full paper deadline, every co-author needs to create (or update) an OpenReview profile. The information entered in the profile is used for conflict resolution, as discussed in this document  . 
  I don't have a DBLP page or previous publications, how can I complete my OpenReview profile?  It is okay to leave the DBLP and papers empty in this case, but please make sure to add all of your email addresses and add your affiliations under "Education & Career History". Also please fill out this no prior publications form  . 
  I have publications but no DBLP page.  You can import your papers directly into Openreview. 
  I have publications but not in Computer Science. Do I need to upload them?  No. 
  I missed the abstract submission deadline. Can I still submit a full paper?  No. The abstract submission deadline is firm. 
  Can I submit supplementary material after the deadline?  Yes. The deadline for supplementary material (including appendix and source code) is one week after the paper deadline. Check the call for papers for the exact day and time. 
  Can I withdraw my submission?  Yes. You can withdraw your submission at any point in the reviewing process. 
  What exactly should be submitted by the abstract deadline?  The abstract of your paper, which can be edited afterwards up until the full paper deadline. You can also submit the full paper if you wish. 
  Submission format and content  
 Can I include appendices in my main submission file?  No. You can include them in the supplementary materials. 
  I would like to write my paper using Microsoft Word, but I don’t see a template. Can you provide one?  No. The Microsoft Word template has been discontinued. Authors must use the NeurIPS 2023 LaTeX style file. 
  Is there guidance for filling out the NeurIPS paper checklist?  Yes! See this document, which is linked from the CFP: https://neurips.cc/public/guides/PaperChecklist  . You may also be interested in the blog post  from 2021 which explains the motivation behind the checklist and how it was created. 
  Is a "broader impact" statement required and must it fit within the page limit?  You are not required to include a section titled "broader impacts" in your paper. However, you should still consider any potential negative societal impacts of your work. You may include a discussion of these potential negative societal impacts anywhere in the paper (in the intro, in the conclusion, as a stand-alone section, in the supplemental material if appropriate, etc.), but this discussion may not exceed the page limit. See the checklist guidance  and blog post  for more information. 
  What material is allowed beyond the nine-page limit?  The main body of your paper must be contained in the first nine pages of your submission. Only references are not included in this page limit. You may include an appendix in a separate document as part of your supplemental material. 
  What is the policy on comparisons to recent work?  Papers appearing less than two months before the submission deadline are generally considered concurrent to NeurIPS submissions. Authors are not expected to compare to work that appeared only a month or two before the deadline. 
  Are arxiv papers also subject to the policy above?  Yes, we do not distinguish arxiv papers and other published (conference & journal) papers, and the two-month rule applies in the same way. More nuanced judgements, including how to determine the date of publication, should be made by the area chair handling the submission. 
  Dual submissions  
 Can I submit work to NeurIPS that is currently in submission to another archival venue?  The NeurIPS policy on dual submissions explicitly prohibits this. You need to withdraw your submission from the other venue before submitting to NeurIPS. 
  Can I submit work to NeurIPS and then later submit the same work to another archival venue while it is still under review at NeurIPS?  The NeurIPS policy on dual submissions explicitly prohibits this. You need to withdraw your submission from NeurIPS first. 
  Can I submit work that is in submission to, has been accepted to, or has been published in a non-archival venue (e.g. arXiv or a workshop without any official proceedings)?  Yes, as long as this does not violate the other venue's policy on dual submissions (if it has one). 
  Can I submit work to NeurIPS and then later submit the same work to a non-archival venue while it is still under review at NeurIPS?  Yes, as long as this does not violate the other venue's policy on dual submissions (if it has one). 
  Questions related to OpenReview  
 Why haven't I received any emails about my submission?  All emails are sent from noreply@openreview.net. If you are an author and not receiving email, please log into your OpenReview account and make sure that your preferred contact email is up to date. We have heard that some email servers are rejecting email from OpenReview. If you suspect this might apply to your email server, we recommend that you use a different email address. 
  Please visit https://openreview.net/faq  for general questions related to OpenReview. If you experience any technical issues, please contact the OpenReview support team at info@openreview.net  directly. 
  Reviewing/Discussion process  
 When will the reviews be available? When is the rebuttal due? | Please refer to the main conference track | dates | . 
  Will the rebuttals be shown to the reviewers/ACs immediately? | No, the rebuttals will be revealed to the reviewers/ACs at the end of the rebuttal period. 
  Can we upload a revision of our paper during the rebuttal/discussion period? | No revisions are allowed until the camera-ready stage. 
  Can we upload a revision of the supplementary materials during the rebuttal/discussion period? | No. You may revise it for the camera-ready stage. 
  Can the rebuttal include new results? | Yes, however your original submission will serve as the basis for the reviewers' (and ACs') acceptance recommendations. The rebuttals should serve only to clarify the reviewers' and ACs' questions during the discussion period. 
  Can we include an anonymous link in the author rebuttal? | No. Do not use links in any part of the response. The only exception is if the reviewers asked for code, in which case you can send an anonymized link to the AC in an Official Comment (make sure all linked files are anonymized). 
  Reviewers posted last-minute questions, and the reviewer-author discussion has closed. What do we do? | Area chairs are fully aware that authors cannot respond to last-minute questions, so they will take that into account. We cannot extend the author-reviewer discussion period, as many authors, reviewers, and ACs have planned their work according to our schedule, and extensions would cause delay and additional burden for all involved. 
  What is the length limit in the rebuttal phase? | You can submit a rebuttal of up to 6000 characters per review, and one global rebuttal of up to 6000 reviews. These are posted by clicking the "Rebuttal" and "Author Rebuttal" buttons. You can additionally add a one-page PDF with Figures and tables. You can upload this PDF after you click the "Author Rebuttal" button. 
  Where can I see my submitted PDF for the author-rebuttal? | There is a link to the PDF at the end of the global rebuttal. 
  What is the "Official Comment" button for? | The official comment button serves to send messages to specific readers. During the rebuttal phase it will only be possible to use it for sending messages to the AC. During the rebuttal phase, do not use the "Official Comment" for posting rebuttal text that should be read by the reviewers. Use the "Rebuttal" buttons for that. During the discussion phase you will be able to use that button for sending messages to either the reviewres or the AC. Make sure the "readers" of the message are those you intend to read it. 
  Miscellaneous  
 Using different versions of latex can yield PDFs of different lengths. What should I do? | This is documented | here | . You can use any version of latex, as long as your PDF obeys the page limit.

 ±  Niki Hasrati and Shai Ben-David receive best paper award at ALT 2023   
   
 Tuesday, February 14, 2023    
   
 Master’s candidate Niki Hasrati and Professor Shai Ben-David have received the best paper award  at ALT 2023  , the 34 th  International Conference on Algorithmic Learning Theory. This year the annual meeting that explores the theoretical and algorithmic aspects of machine learning will take place in Singapore from February 20 to 23.  
 Their paper, “ On Computable Online Learning  ,” studies online learning with computable learners. It analyzes that question under various requirements for successful learning. The paper gives a necessary and sufficient condition for optimal computable online learning and shows that the Littlestone dimension  — a combinatorial parameter that characterizes online learnability without computability requirements — no longer applies when the learners are required to be computable.

 Join us in Hawaii for our 40th anniversary!  
   
 The Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC)  brings together leading researchers and practitioners, along with a diverse group of security professionals drawn from academia, industry, and government, gathered to present and discuss the latest cybersecurity results and topics. With peer reviewed technical papers, invited talks, panels, national interest discussions, and workshops, ACSAC continues its core mission of investigating practical solutions for computer and network security technologies.  
 This year, we will celebrate ACSAC's 40th edition. ACSAC's first edition was held in 1985 and is now one of the oldest computer security conferences, second only to the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy. We invite you to join us for this special anniversary, which will be held near the infamous Waikiki Beach in Honolulu, Hawaii!  
 As an internationally recognized forum where researchers, practitioners, and developers meet to learn and to exchange practical ideas and experiences in computer and network security, we invite you to submit your work. In addition to peer-reviewed papers on novel applied research, we also welcome case studies on real-world applications, panels featuring world experts, and workshops consisting of 1-2 day sessions on hot cybersecurity and privacy topics.

 Hard Topic Theme: Security Applications of Generative AI   
 This year's hard topic theme solicits research results and technologies that advance our understanding of the applicability of Generative AI and Large Language Models to computer security. These transformative new technologies can have a significant impact in addressing traditional security problems, such as vulnerability detection, fraud detection, reverse engineering, threat intelligence, and many others. At the same time, the complexity of these systems also exposes new potential vulnerabilities that are still not well understood by the research community.

 ITiCSE 2023 (10 – 12 July)  
   Welcome to the 28th annual ACM  conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE). ITiCSE conference is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Computing Education (SIGCSE)  , in collaboration with the ACM Europe Council  , and Informatics Europe  . ITiCSE 2023 will take place in Turku, Finland, and it is hosted by University of Turku (UTU)  .  
 Destination: Turku, Finland   
 Turku, located in Southwest Finland, is a European city of culture where the fresh sea breeze, the breath of history and modern bustle meet. Founded almost 800 years ago, Turku is the oldest city of Finland and the former capital of the country. Turku has witnessed both the launch of reformation and the birth of the nation’s written language. Notably, at regular intervals until 1827 the city burnt to the ground and had to be rebuilt. The country’s first university was founded in Turku in 1640.  
 Today, Turku is a city of about 200,000 inhabitants. The city is known for its maritime and pharmaceutical industries, vibrant harbor, large archipelago, marvelous Gothic cathedral, medieval castle, and large student population. The city is officially bilingual, meaning that about 5% of the population speaks Swedish as their native language. Tervetuloa! Välkommen! Welcome!

 Title:  ML-based attack detection: a case study for Telecom networks   
   
 Abstract:  Starting from detecting Spams in email services, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have been used to fight fraud and cyberattacks for several decades. The breakthrough in Deep Learning (DL) a decade ago has drastically improved the performance of ML in different applications, notably in computer vision. Recently, this trend has been accelerated further by the Large Language Models (LLMs). In this talk, we will first survey the development in ML and its application in attack detection, and subsequently elaborate on the importance of datasets by focusing on the imbalance Issue in (software) vulnerability detection. Then, we will dive into attack detection in Telecom networks and demonstrate the empirical results of a dozen of DL models on both real-world and simulated datasets. Finally, we will highlight some challenges and lessons learned in our research.

 Title:  Controlled data sharing in distributed collaborative scenarios   
   
 Abstract:  The availability of highly performing systems and services (e.g., cloud/fog/edge/IoT) for gathering, storing, and processing data, and of analysis techniques on large data collections, bring great benefits on a personal, business, economic and social level. The collection, sharing, and analysis of data, with contributions from different sources and different actors are in fact great enabling factors for the increasingly digitally evolved society. This typically also involves data management and computation by external storage and computational providers that may be not fully trusted. In this talk, I will address in particular: the protection of data in the context of collaborative distributed computation involving different authorities and computational providers, and the support of query execution on data stored at external not fully trusted providers.   

 Prof. Liqun Chen    

  Bio:  Liqun Chen is a Professor in Secure Systems at the University of Surrey. Prior to taking this position in 2016, she was a principal research scientist at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, Bristol, UK. She developed several cryptographic schemes that were adopted by International Standards bodies, ISO/IEC, IEEE and TCG (Trusted Computing Group). In particular, she designed several cryptographic algorithms (including direct anonymous attestation and the multiple signature interfaces) used in the Trusted Platform Module (TPM). She co-authored the paper “Direct anonymous attestation”, which was originally published at ACM CCS 2004 and received a Test of Time award at ACM CCS 2014. She was the technical leader and principal investigator in the EU H2020 FutureTPM project, which identified and developed algorithms for a TPM that will be secure against quantum computer attacks. She is also a principal investigator in five other EU Horizon projects, which make use of trusted computing and distributed ledger technologies to achieve security, privacy and trust in real world applications. Her current research interests are applied cryptography, trusted computing, and network security.   
   
 Title:  How to Align Trusted Computing with Security and Privacy?   
   
 Abstract:  In cyber security applications, balancing privacy, security and trust is challenging but necessary. In this talk, we will focus on trusted computing, particularly the use of its core technology – attestation services – to enhance security. We will discuss how to extend the techniques of attesting to a single device to complex computer systems, such as computer networks, and how to preserve privacy in those services. Finally, we will discuss how to achieve trusted computing in the long term, by which we mean that its privacy/security/trust features should not be limited by the lifetime of any underlying cryptographic algorithms.

 Title:  Covert & Side Stories: Threats Evolution in Traditional and Modern Technologies   
   
 Abstract:  Alongside traditional Information and Communication Technologies, more recent ones like Smartphones and IoT devices also became pervasive. Furthermore, all technologies manage an increasing amount of confidential data. The concern of protecting these data is not only related to an adversary gaining physical or remote control of a victim device through traditional attacks, but also to what extent an adversary without the above capabilities can infer or steal information through side and covert channels! In this talk, we survey a corpus of representative research results published in the domain of side and covert channels, ranging from TIFS 2016 to more recent Usenix Security 2022, and including several demonstrations at Black Hat Hacking Conferences. We discuss threats coming from contextual information and to which extent it is feasible to infer very specific information. In particular, we discuss attacks like inferring actions that a user is doing on mobile apps, by eavesdropping their encrypted network traffic, identifying the presence of a specific user within a network through analysis of energy consumption, or inferring information (also key one like passwords and PINs) through timing, acoustic, or video information.

  ITiCSE Conference 

 ITiCSE Conference  
 We are calling for expressions of interest in the ITiCSE leadership for future years.    
 The ACM Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE) is one of four conferences sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE). It is the only SIGCSE conference overseen in conjunction with two other organizations, the ACM Europe Council and Informatics Europe. It is an international informatics/computing education conference held annually in Europe in June or July and has existed since 1996.  
 SIGCSE provides a forum for educators to discuss issues related to the development, implementation, and/or evaluation of computing programs, curricula, and courses, as well as syllabi, laboratories, and other elements of teaching and pedagogy. ACM Europe Council was created by ACM to recognise and support European ACM members and activities. Informatics Europe represents the academic and research community in Informatics in Europe. With over 140 member institutions across 33 countries, Informatics Europe promotes common positions and acts on common priorities including informatics education.  
 The ITiCSE conference has been held annually since 1996, in late June or early July. It has been held in many different countries (see list below). Attendance regularly exceeds 200. This conference brings together delegates from all over the world to address pressing issues in computing education. In addition to invited lectures, paper, panel, poster and "tips & techniques" sessions, the conference provides facilities and exposure for working groups of up to ten members, whose final reports may be published by SIGCSE. Exhibits and tutorials are also offered. Plus good food, good company and interesting locales. If you have never been to an ITiCSE, do yourself a favor and go. You will not regret it!

  Submission Instructions  
 High-quality papers in all PST-related areas that, at the time of submission are not under review and have not already been published or accepted for publication elsewhere are solicited. Authors MUST ensure to select the track (Privacy, Security, or Trust) most relevant to their research when submitting their paper. Accepted papers will be accepted as ‘regular’ papers up to 10 pages, or ‘short’ papers of up to 5 pages. Up to 2 additional pages will be allowed in each category with over-length charges. Every additional page has a cost of $100.00 (CND). The standard IEEE two-column conference format should be used for all submissions. IEEE Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings can be downloaded here. The conference proceedings will be submitted for inclusion in IEEE Xplore as in previous editions of the conference.  
   
  Double-blind Submission  
 Reviewing will be double-blind: the reviewers will not know the identities of the authors. It will be up to the authors to ensure the proper anonymization of their paper. For effective anonymization please follow these guidelines:  
  Do not include any author's name or affiliation in the title. Do not include any acknowledgments. Refer to your own published work in the third person: use “In the previous work of Jones et al.”, not “In our previous work”. If you cite own papers that are not widely available (e.g., a paper currently under review), use anonymous author names in the citation, for example, an author of the form “A. Anonymous”.
