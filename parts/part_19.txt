Similar to previous years, ACML 2023 has two publication tracks  . Authors may submit either to: 
Conference Track: | (16-page limit with references) for which the proceedings will be published as a volume of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research Workshop and Conference Proceedings (PMLR).
 Journal Track: | (20-page limit with references) for which accepted papers will appear in a special issue of the Springer Machine Learning Journal (MLJ).
 Please note that submission procedures for the two tracks are different. Please read the instructions carefully before submitting.   
Conference Track 
Submission Deadline: June 30, 2023  June 23, 2023   For the conference track, please submit your manuscript via CMT at: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACML2023  . 
IMPORTANT:   When creating a new submission on CMT, please ensure you choose the "Conference"  track. 
The Latex submission template and style file can be found here: ACML2023_submission_template.zip  . 
 The Latex camera-ready template and style file can be found here: ACML2023_camera-ready_template.zip  . 
Manuscripts must be written in English, be a maximum of 16 pages (including references, appendices, etc.) and follow the PMLR style. If required, supplementary material may be submitted as a separate file, but reviewers are not obliged to consider this. 
All conference track submissions must be anonymized  . Submissions that are not anonymized, over-length, or not in the correct format will be rejected without review. To anonymize, simply leave the author information empty in the Tex template. There is no separate format for anonymizing. 
It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g., in arXiv) as long as it is not cited in the submission. 
Journal Track 
Submission Deadline: June 02, 2023  May 26, 2023   In addition to the conference track, this year’s ACML will run a journal track, similar to previous years. Papers that are accepted to the journal track must be presented at the conference in order to be published. 
IMPORTANT:   Similar to previous years, for the journal track, the abstract and the paper must be submitted to two different systems simultaneously   for the purpose of review management: 
First, please submit ONLY the title and abstract via CMT at: | https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACML2023. | (paper manuscript need not be submitted here). When creating the submission on CMT, please choose the | "Journal" | track.
 Then, please submit the paper via Springer’s Editorial Manager system at: | https://www.editorialmanager.com/mach. | When creating a new submission on Springer’s Editorial Manager, please make sure to choose | "S.I.: ACML 2023" | as the article type.
 For the journal track, manuscripts must be written in English with a maximum of 20 pages (including references, appendices, etc.). For the template and style files, please follow the instructions for authors on the journal website: https://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10994  . 
The journal track will follow the reviewing process of the Machine Learning journal. This includes allowing papers that require minor changes to be resubmitted after a first-round review. The journal track committee will aim to complete the reviewing process in time for this year’s conference. In the unlikely event that the reviewing process for a paper is not completed in time (for this year’s conference), the paper will not be considered for the conference and the review will be completed as a regular submission to the Machine Learning journal. 
The journal track review is single-blind, i.e., the authors’ identity will be visible to reviewers. It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. Submissions that are not in the correct format will be rejected without review. In addition, extended versions of published conference papers are not eligible for journal track submission. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g., in arXiv).
14. ACML_3 conference:

Some of our participants are unfortunately facing visa challenges  that might prevent them from joining us in person at the conference. We understand the immense effort and dedication it takes to contribute to ACM Multimedia 2023, and we want to reassure everyone that even if you cannot attend in person due to unforeseen circumstances, your paper will still be featured in the conference proceedings. Our team is dedicated to ensuring a fulfilling and enriching experience for all participants, whether they attend in person or online. We will do our utmost to accommodate any challenges and ensure a satisfactory conference experience for all. 
In addition, we’d like to inform you that your paper will be presented in a 2-minute teaser session for those attending in person. For those who may not be able to make it in person, we will also have 2-minute teaser sessions in separate offline sessions to ensure your research receives the attention it deserves.  
We hope to see as many of you as possible, and we thank you for your understanding.

Make sure to book your hotel stay at the Westin Hotel,  Ottawa conference hotel. The hotel  is at the center of the conference activity, and will allow you to network easily with other conference attendees. Also, it’s a quick trip to get to the program and functions, and just as quick to nip back to your room for a break. Staying at the conference hotel will provide a better conference experience! 
Everyone enjoys meeting in a comfortable conference venue, offering quality service and support for workshops, tutorials, plenary sessions, and other activities. As the transaction for those services and support, the conference guarantees that a percentage of attendees will stay in the hotel. The contract with the hotel then guarantees a specific number of sleeping rooms will be used each night during the conference. If the conference does not meet the contracted sleeping room commitment, the hotel gets paid anyway. Those unfilled rooms will cost the conference thousands of dollars. 
Please support ACMMM 2023 and SIGMM by staying at the Westin Hotel!

AAAI-23 Main Technical Track 
Call for Papers 
 All authors must complete a reproducibility checklist, which facilitates replication of the reported research.
 All authors are expected to be available to review (light load), unless extenuating circumstances apply.
 NeurIPS-22 Fast Track: rejected papers with *final, average* scores of at least 4.9 may be submitted directly into AAAI-23’s Phase 2 along with, for example, previous reviews and paper ID.
 The purpose of the AAAI conference series is to promote research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and foster scientific exchange between researchers, practitioners, scientists, students, and engineers across the entirety of AI and its affiliated disciplines. AAAI-23 is the Thirty-Seventh AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. The theme of this conference is to create collaborative bridges  within and beyond AI. Like previous AAAI conferences, AAAI-23 will feature technical paper presentations, special tracks, invited speakers, workshops, tutorials, poster sessions, senior member presentations, competitions, and exhibit programs, and two new activities: a Bridge Program and a Lab Program. Many of these activities are tailored to the theme of bridges and all are selected according to the highest standards, with additional programs for students and young researchers. 
Driven by its disciplinary diversity, AAAI has incubated numerous AI sub-disciplines and conferences and has nurtured for decades the cohesion of AI. New communities often emerge when two or more disciplines come together in order to explore new opportunities and perspectives; today both are plentiful. The purpose of this year’s Bridge Program is to tap into new sources of innovation by cultivating sustained collaboration between two or more communities, directed towards a common goal. Our interpretation of bridge  is broad and encompasses disciplines both within and outside of AI. Hence, the communities that our Bridge Program is intended to bring together could be distinct subfields of AI, such as planning and learning, or different disciplines that contribute to and benefit from AI, such as AI and the humanities. 
We plan for AAAI-23 to be an in-person conference and are exploring opportunities to complement this with remote participation. Given the volatile situation, however, the exact format of the conference can only be decided at a later stage.

ADCOM 2023: Adaptive, Generative and Bio-inspired AI in Computing and Communication  
The Advanced Computing and Communications Society  (ACCS) in association with the Digital University Kerala  announces the 28th annual International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications  (ADCOM 2023) at Maker Village, Kochi during 8th – 10th December 2023. 
ADCOM, the flagship Systems Conference of the ACCS, is a major annual international meeting that draws leading scientists and researchers in computational and communications engineering from across industry and academia. ADCOM highlights the growing importance of Large-Scale Systems Engineering and provides the platform to share, discuss and witness leading edge research and trends. 
ADCOM 2023 explores the current state-of-art AI covering a broad spectrum of adaptive, generative and bio-inspired algorithms and/or hardware useful in computing and communications. Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can create new content, such as text, images, or other media, from scratch. Generative AI models are trained on large datasets of existing content, and then use this data to learn the patterns and rules that govern how that content is created. Generative AI has a wide range of potential applications in Content creation, Data augmentation, Artificial intelligence assistant, Entertainment, Product design etc.

Call for papers  
The ACM MobiCom conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions in the field of wireless networking and mobile computing. MobiCom solicits papers that address important research challenges and build practical working systems. Successful papers should propose novel ideas to attack such problems through rigorous analysis, system design and real-world measurement or deployment of mobile networks, systems and applications. 
 
 MobiCom’23 will emphasize novelty and creativity while, at the same time, taking a broader and more inclusive view of wireless and mobile systems research. On one hand, the more novel the concept, the harder it can be to fully develop or evaluate all its aspects. On the other hand the more practical and developed the system, the more simple and sometimes known techniques must be leveraged. The review process will take both cases into account as intellectual merit and novelty can be found in techniques, system designs, implementations, and applications. The review process will also favor papers that describe how the authors will provide access to well-documented datasets, modeling and/or simulation tools, and codebases to support the reproducibility of their methods as well as papers that highlight and discuss not only the significance but also the limitations of the work. 
 
 Unlike in previous years, MobiCom’23 will not have separate categories of challenge, experience, and verification papers. However, we do encourage the submission of experience papers as full papers that provide detailed technical insight into real-world deployments of novel technologies and systems. MobiCom'23 will also incorporate early notifications for papers rejected in round 1 and rebuttals as described below in more detail.

 Two Deadlines, Early Notification, Rebuttals, and One-shot Revision 

 MobiCom 2023 offers authors the option of two deadlines and keeps the one-shot revision process to enhance the timeliness and quality of the scientific results from the research community. Each paper will go through the same rigorous reviewing process as in previous MobiCom conferences. The review process for each deadline will involve two rounds. Papers that are not selected to proceed after the first round will receive an early notification, including reviews. After the second round of reviews, the reviews will be released to the authors and who will have one week to submit a rebuttal. 
 
 Rebuttals 
MobiCom will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to the final consideration of the papers at the program committee meeting. Authors must limit their responses to (a) correcting factual errors in the reviews or (b) directly addressing questions posed by reviewers. Responses should be limited to clarifying the submitted work. In particular, responses must not include new experiments, new data, or new figures, describe additional work completed since submission or promise additional work to follow. 
 
 The submission of a rebuttal is optional. Rebuttals will be limited to a maximum of 1000 words submitted in the online submission form. It is worth noting that available reviews will be released at the above-mentioned times. However, additional reviews might be solicited or submitted after the rebuttal period. 
 
 Final decisions will be one of the following 

 Accept | : Accepted papers will be presented at the MobiCom conference and appear as part of the proceedings and the MobiCom website. Note all the papers in this category will initially be | conditionally accepted | . The papers that go through a successful | anonymous | shepherding process will eventually be accepted.
 Reject | : Rejected after reviewed papers cannot be resubmitted until 11 months have passed since the last MobiCom deadline they were submitted to. We strongly encourage the authors to address reviewers' feedback before re-submitting the paper to MobiCom.
 One-Shot-Revision | : Papers, where a revision is required, will be given specific action points and can be resubmitted for the | next | deadline. For such papers, the reviewers will articulate a maximum of three major changes/clarifications that they would like to see. After the resubmission, the paper will be evaluated based on whether the authors have properly addressed the reviewers’ requests. Unlike in the shepherding process, the requested action points may include running additional experiments that obtain specific results and could take more than 4-6 weeks. During this revision period, the paper is still considered under review to MobiCom and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration.
 
 Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers 
The authors of accepted MobiCom 2023 papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee that will assess how well the submitted artifacts support the work described in the accepted papers. Participation in Artifact Evaluation is voluntary and has no influence on the paper’s acceptance, but is strongly encouraged. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive badges printed on the papers themselves. Additional details on the Artifact Evaluation process can be found here. 
 
 Submission Instructions 

 All paper submissions will be handled electronically at the MobiCom ’23 paper submission website  . Authors should prepare a PDF version of their full paper. All submitted papers will be evaluated through a double-blind  reviewing process, with the identities of the authors withheld from the reviewers. 
 
 Before final submission, you are expected to make sure that your paper complies with the following requirements. Please do not violate these requirements with the aim of including additional material: ​submissions that violate the formatting requirements may not be reviewed​.  You can visually inspect a page-by-page report of your paper format using the same tool as the submission system via a separate ​ online form  . After the submission deadline, we will use the same tool to check the conformance of papers. The format checking tool uses heuristics and can make mistakes. The PC chairs will manually inspect and possibly reject those papers with evident format violations. However, no paper will be rejected due to format violations without being manually checked. 
 
 Any papers that do not adhere to the following guidelines may be immediately rejected:

  ISCO 2024 | What is ISCO?   
  ISCO (Integer Symposium on Combinatorial Optimization) is a biannual symposium whose aim is to bring together researchers from all the communities related to combinatorial optimization, including algorithms and complexity, mathematical programming, operations research, stochastic optimization, graphs and combinatorics. Quality papers on all aspects of combinatorial optimization, from mathematical foundations and theory of algorithms to computational studies and practical applications, are solicited.  
 Each ISCO conference is preceded or followed by a Spring School lectured by international Combinatorial Optimization searches. This school is dedicated to PhD students but the lectures are also opened to older colleagues.  
 Scope of ISCO   
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Approximation algorithms 
  Branch-and-bound algorithms 
  Branch-and-cut-and price algorithms 
  Computational biology 
  Computational complexity 
  Computational geometry

  On-line algorithms 
  Polyhedral combinatorics 
  Randomized algorithms 
  Scheduling algorithms 
  A bit of history   
  The first  issue of ISCO was held in Hammamet, Tunisia in March 2010  . This first attempt gathered more than 200 participants in a beautiful mediterranean country. The plenary sessions as well as all the talks have shown the large spectrum of our Combinatorial Optimization domain. Pierre Bonami from University of Méditerranée, Gerard Cornuéjols from Carnegie Mellon University and Andrea Lodi from University of Bologna have given a Spring School on "Cutting plane methods for integer and combinatorial optimization".  
   
  A selection of short papers presented at ISCO 2012 has been published by Springer-Verlag in the Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics (ENDM): ISCO2010 ENDM volume  .  
   
  A special issue in 2010 DAM special issue  has been published.  
  
   The second  issue has been moved to the other side of the Mediterranean Sea in Athens, Greece in April 2012  . This second conference has been organized with colleagues from the Athens University Of Economics & Business in the deep center of the famous town. From this conference, ISCO topics has been extended to Theoretical Computer Science aspects of Combinatorial Optimization. A Spring School was organized around "Mathematical Programming and Design of Approximation Algorithms" with lectures by David Shmoys and David Williamson from Cornell University, USA.  
   
  A selection of short papers presented at ISCO 2012 has been published by Elsevier in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS): ISCO2012 LNCS volume  .

 PyTorch 2.0: The Journey to Bringing Compiler Technologies to the Core of PyTorch (Keynote)   
 Peng Wu 
  Four and a half years after PyTorch 1.0, we announced PyTorch 2.0 at the PyTorch Conference last December. The message was simple – introducing compiled mode, torch.compile(), to the core of PyTorch. This talk shares our 5-year journey of finding the right compiler solutions for PyTorch. We answer questions like: (i) Why did it take so long? (ii) What was the biggest challenge of designing compiler solutions for PyTorch? (iii) How did we co-design the compiler w/ the core of PyTorch? (iiii) What conventions did we break in the design of TorchDynamo and TorchInductor?  
 As an ML compiler, PyTorch 2.0 is unconventional in many ways. By sharing our thought processes, insights, and design decisions during the development of PT2, we hope to bring new thinking into the thriving landscape of ML compilers and inject a dose of real-world considerations into the research community.

 Code Generation for In-Place Stencils

  Numerical simulation often resorts to iterative in-place stencils such as the Gauss-Seidel or Successive Overrelaxation (SOR) methods. Writing high performance implementations of such stencils requires significant effort and time; it also involves non-local transformations beyond the stencil kernel itself. While automated code generation is a mature technology for image processing stencils, convolutions and out-of-place iterative stencils (such as the Jacobi method), the optimization of in-place stencils requires manual craftsmanship. Building on recent advances in tensor compiler construction, we propose the first domain-specific code generator for iterative in-place stencils. Starting from a generic tensor compiler implemented in the MLIR framework, tensor abstractions are incrementally refined and lowered down to parallel, tiled, fused and vectorized code. We used our generator to implement a realistic, implicit solver for structured meshes, and demonstrate results competitive with an industrial computational fluid dynamics framework. We also compare with stand-alone stencil kernels for dense tensors.  

 To Pack or Not to Pack: A Generalized Packing Analysis and Transformation

  Packing is an essential loop optimization for handcrafting a high-performance General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM). Packing copies a non-contiguous block of data to a contiguous block to reduce the number of TLB entries required to access it, avoiding expensive TLB misses. When copying data, packing can rearrange elements of the block to decrease the stride between consecutive accesses, improving spatial locality. Until now the use of packing has been limited to handcrafted GEMM implementations and to auto-tuning techniques. Existing loop optimizers, such as Polly and Pluto, either only apply packing to GEMM computations (Polly), or not at all (Pluto). This work proposes GPAT, a generalized packing analysis and code transformation that applies packing, when beneficial, to a generic input loop nest. GPAT is implemented in the Affine dialect of MLIR and evaluated on Polybench/C. GPAT applies packing to benchmarks beyond GEMM and obtains significant speedup compared to current loop optimizers that do not apply packing.

  Many scientific applications compute using sparse data and store that data in a variety of sparse formats because each format has unique space and performance benefits. Optimizing applications that use sparse data involves translating the sparse data into the chosen format and transforming the computation to iterate over that format. This paper presents a formal definition of sparse tensor formats and an automated approach to synthesize the transformation between formats. This approach is unique in that it supports ordering constraints not supported by other approaches and synthesizes the transformation code in a high-level intermediate representation suitable for applying composable transformations such as loop fusion and temporary storage reduction. We demonstrate that the synthesized code for COO to CSR with optimizations is 2.85x faster than TACO, Intel MKL, and SPARSKIT while the more complex COO to DIA is 1.4x slower than TACO but faster than SPARSKIT and Intel MKL using the geometric average of execution time.  

 Looplets: A Language for Structured Coiteration

  Real world arrays often contain underlying structure, such as sparsity, runs of repeated values, or symmetry. Specializing for structure yields significant speedups. But automatically generating efficient code for structured data is challenging, especially when arrays with different structure interact. We show how to abstract over array structures so that the compiler can generate code to coiterate over any combination of them. Our technique enables new array formats (such as 1DVBL for irregular clustered sparsity), new iteration strategies (such as galloping intersections), and new operations over structured data (such as concatenation or convolution).

  Software obfuscation techniques can prevent binary diffing techniques from locating vulnerable code by obfuscating the third-party code, to achieve the purpose of protecting embedded device software. With the rapid development of binary diffing techniques, they can achieve more and more accurate function matching and identification by extracting the features within the function. This makes existing software obfuscation techniques, which mainly focus on the intra-procedural code obfuscation, no longer effective.  
 In this paper, we propose a new inter-procedural code obfuscation mechanism Khaos, which moves the code across functions to obfuscate the function by using compilation optimizations. Two obfuscation primitives are proposed to separate and aggregate the function, which are called fission and fusion respectively. A prototype of Khaos is implemented based on the LLVM compiler and evaluated on a large number of real-world programs including SPEC CPU 2006 & 2017, CoreUtils, JavaScript engines, etc. Experimental results show that Khaos outperforms existing code obfuscations and can significantly reduce the accuracy rates of five state-of-the-art binary diffing techniques (less than 19%) with lower runtime overhead (less than 7%).  

 Lifting Code Generation of Cardiac Physiology Simulation to Novel Compiler Technology

  The study of numerical models for the human body has become a major focus of the research community in biology and medicine. For instance, numerical ionic models of a complex organ, such as the heart, must be able to represent individual cells and their interconnections through ionic channels, forming a system with billions of cells, and requiring efficient code to handle such a large system. The modeling of the electrical system of the heart combines a compute-intensive kernel that calculates the intensity of current flowing through cell membranes, and feeds a linear solver for computing the electrical potential of each cell.  
 Considering this context, we propose limpetMLIR, a code generator and compiler transformer to accelerate the kernel phase of ionic models and bridge the gap between compiler technology and electrophysiology simulation. LimpetMLIR makes use of the MLIR infrastructure, its dialects, and transformations to drive forward the study of ionic models, and accelerate the execution of multi-cell systems. Experiments conducted in 43 ionic models show that our limpetMLIR based code generation greatly outperforms current state-of-the-art simulation systems by an average of 2.9x, reaching peak speedups of more than 15x in some cases. To our knowledge, this is the first work that deeply connects an optimizing compiler infrastructure to electrophysiology models of the human body, showing the potential benefits of using compiler technology in the simulation of human cell interactions.  

 DJXPerf: Identifying Memory Inefficiencies via Object-Centric Profiling for Java

  Java is the “go-to” programming language choice for developing scalable enterprise cloud applications. In such systems, even a few percent CPU time savings can offer a significant competitive advantage and cost savings. Although performance tools abound for Java, those that focus on the data locality in the memory hierarchy are rare.  
 In this paper, we first categorize data locality issues in Java programs. We then present DJXPerf, a lightweight, object-centric memory profiler for Java, which associates memory-hierarchy performance metrics (e.g., cache/TLB misses) with Java objects. DJXPerf uses statistical sampling of hardware performance monitoring counters to attribute metrics to not only source code locations but also Java objects. DJXPerf presents Java object allocation contexts combined with their usage contexts and presents them ordered by the poor locality behaviors. DJXPerf’s performance measurement, object attribution, and presentation techniques guide optimizing object allocation, layout, and access patterns. DJXPerf incurs only ~8.5% runtime overhead and ∼6% memory overhead on average, requiring no modifications to hardware, OS, Java virtual machine, or application source code, which makes it attractive to use in production. Guided by DJXPerf, we study and optimize a number of Java and Scala programs, including well-known benchmarks and real-world applications, and demonstrate significant speedups.

 Fast Polynomial Evaluation for Correctly Rounded Elementary Functions using the RLIBM Approach   
 Mridul Aanjaneya 
  Santosh Nagarakatte 
  This paper proposes fast polynomial evaluation methods for correctly rounded elementary functions generated using our RLibm approach. The resulting functions produce correct results for all inputs with multiple representations and rounding modes. Given an oracle, the RLibm approach approximates the correctly rounded result rather than the real value of an elementary function. A key observation is that there is an interval of real values around the correctly rounded result such that any real value in it rounds to the correct result. This interval is the maximum freedom available to RLibm’s polynomial generation procedure. Subsequently, the problem of generating correctly rounded elementary functions using these intervals can be structured as a linear programming problem. Our prior work on the RLibm approach uses Horner’s method for polynomial evaluation.  
 This paper explores polynomial evaluation techniques such as Knuth’s coefficient adaptation procedure, parallel execution of operations using Estrin’s procedure, and the use of fused multiply-add operations in the context of the RLibm approach. If we take the polynomial generated by the RLibm approach and subsequently perform polynomial evaluation optimizations, it results in incorrect results due to rounding errors during polynomial evaluation. Hence, we propose to integrate the fast polynomial evaluation procedure in the RLibm’s polynomial generation process. Our new polynomial evaluation procedure that combines parallel execution with fused multiply-add operations outperforms the Horner’s method used by RLibm’s correctly rounded functions. We show the resulting polynomials for 32-bit float are not only correct but also faster than prior functions in RLibm by 24%

  Algorithm classification consists in determining which algorithm a program implements, given a finite set of candidates. Classifiers are used in applications such malware identification and plagiarism detection. There exist many ways to implement classifiers. There are also many ways to implement evaders to deceive the classifiers. This paper analyzes the state-of-the-art classification and evasion techniques. To organize this analysis, this paper brings forward a system of four games that matches classifiers and evaders. Games vary according to the amount of information that is given to each player. This setup lets us analyze a space formed by the combination of nine program encodings; seven obfuscation passes; and six stochastic classification models. Observations from this study include: (i) we could not measure substantial advantages of recent vector-based program representations over simple histograms of opcodes; (ii) deep neural networks recently proposed for program classification are no better than random forests; (iii) program optimizations are almost as effective as classic obfuscation techniques to evade classifiers; (iv) off-the-shelf code optimizations can completely remove the evasion power of naïve obfuscators; (v) control-flow flattening and bogus-control flow tend to resist the normalizing power of code optimizations.

  High-level parallel languages (HLPLs) make it easier to write correct parallel programs. Disciplined memory usage in these languages enables new optimizations for hardware bottlenecks, such as cache coherence. In this work, we show how to reduce the costs of cache coherence by integrating the hardware coherence protocol directly with the programming language; no programmer effort or static analysis is required.  
 We identify a new low-level memory property, WARD (WAW Apathy and RAW Dependence-freedom), by construction  in HLPL programs. We design a new coherence protocol, WARDen, to selectively disable coherence using WARD.  
 We evaluate WARDen with a widely-used HLPL benchmark suite on both current and future x64 machine structures. WARDen both accelerates the benchmarks (by an average of 1.46x) and reduces energy (by 23%) by eliminating unnecessary data movement and coherency messages.  

 SESSION: Domain-Specific Compilation and Debugging  
 Compiling Functions onto Digital Microfluidics   
 Tyson Loveless 
  Philip Brisk 
  Digital Microfluidic Biochips (DMFBs) have the potential to fundamentally transform biochemical disciplines through automation, miniaturization, and the ability to facilitate repeatable chemical experimentation. Programming DMFBs has historically been accomplished by writing low-level bit manipulations to select which electrodes should activate in sequence. Recent research on high-level programming languages and compilers for DMFBs have begun to address the programmability challenge, but important capabilities such as loading and executing pre-compiled libraries and function calls, are absent from the literature. A primary driver of this oversight is the lack of a memory hierarchy to store physical chemicals off-chip to jump to and from function calls. This paper addresses the complexities involved in compiling function calls within the technology's unique boundaries, and provides a proof-of-concept implementation from language to code generation, with solutions evaluated using a cycle-accurate DMFB simulator as well as physical execution on an open-hardware DMFB.  

 Fine-Tuning Data Structures for Query Processing   
 Amir Shaikhha 
  Marios Kelepeshis 
  Mahdi Ghorbani 
  We introduce a framework for automatically choosing data structures for efficient query processing. Our contributions are twofold. First, we introduce a novel low-level intermediate language that can express the algorithms behind various query processing paradigms such as classical joins, groupjoin, and in-database machine learning engines. This language is designed around the notion of dictionaries and allows for a more fine-grained choice of its low-level implementation. Second, the cost model for alternative implementations is automatically inferred by combining machine learning and program reasoning. The dictionary cost model is learned using a regression model trained over the profiling data of dictionary operations on a given architecture. Program reasoning helps to infer the expected cost of the whole query by combining the learned dictionary cost estimates. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of the trained cost model on microbenchmarks. Furthermore, we show that the code generated by our framework outperforms or is competitive with state-of-the-art analytical query and in-database machine learning engines.  

 D2X: An eXtensible conteXtual Debugger for Modern DSLs   
 Ajay Brahmakshatriya 
  Saman Amarasinghe 
  Compiled Domain Specific Languages are taking over various high-performance domains because of their ability to exploit the domain knowledge and apply optimizations that produce the most specialized code. A lot of research has gone into making DSLs more performant and easy to prototype. But the Achilles heel for DSLs is still the lack of debugging support that provides an end-to-end picture to the user and improves the productivity of both the DSL designer and the end-user. Conventional techniques extend the compilers, the debugging information format, and the debuggers themselves to provide more information than what the debugger can provide when attached to the generated code. Such an approach quickly stops scaling as adding extensions to large and complex debuggers hampers DSL designer productivity. We present D2X, a DSL debugging infrastructure that works with most standard debuggers without any modifications and is easily extensible to capture all the domain specific information the end-user cares about. We show that we can add debugging support to the state-of-the-art graph DSL GraphIt with as little as 1.4% changes to the compiler code base. We also apply our techniques to a meta-programming DSL framework BuildIt so that any DSLs built on top of BuildIt get debugging support without any modifications further boosting the productivity of future DSL designers.

 Bridging Control-Centric and Data-Centric Optimization   
 Tal Ben-Nun 
  Berke Ates 
  Alexandru Calotoiu 
  Torsten Hoefler 
  With the rise of specialized hardware and new programming languages, code optimization has shifted its focus towards promoting data locality. Most production-grade compilers adopt a control-centric mindset --- instruction-driven optimization augmented with scalar-based dataflow --- whereas other approaches provide domain-specific and general purpose data movement minimization, which can miss important control-flow optimizations. As the two representations are not commutable, users must choose one over the other. In this paper, we explore how both control- and data-centric approaches can work in tandem via the Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) framework. Through a combination of an MLIR dialect and specialized passes, we recover parametric, symbolic dataflow that can be optimized within the DaCe framework. We combine the two views into a single pipeline, called DCIR, showing that it is strictly more powerful than either view. On several benchmarks and a real-world application in C, we show that our proposed pipeline consistently outperforms MLIR and automatically uncovers new optimization opportunities with no additional effort.  

 Parsimony: Enabling SIMD/Vector Programming in Standard Compiler Flows

  Achieving peak throughput on modern CPUs requires maximizing the use of single-instruction, multiple-data (SIMD) or vector compute units. Single-program, multiple-data (SPMD) programming models are an effective way to use high-level programming languages to target these ISAs. Unfortunately, many SPMD frameworks have evolved to have either overly-restrictive language specifications or under-specified programming models, and this has slowed the widescale adoption of SPMD-style programming. This paper introduces Parsimony (PARallel SIMd), a SPMD programming approach built with semantics designed to be compatible with multiple languages and to cleanly integrate into the standard optimizing compiler toolchains for those languages. We first explain the Parsimony programming model semantics and how they enable a standalone compiler IR-to-IR pass that can perform vectorization independently of other passes, improving the language and toolchain compatibility of SPMD programming. We then demonstrate a LLVM prototype of the Parsimony approach that matches the performance of ispc, a popular but more restrictive SPMD approach, and achieves 97% of the performance of hand-written AVX-512 SIMD intrinsics on over 70 benchmarks ported from the Simd Library. We finally discuss where Parsimony has exposed parts of existing language and compiler flows where slight improvements could further enable improved SPMD program vectorization.

  Modern programming languages offer abstractions that simplify software development and allow hardware to reach its full potential. These abstractions range from the well-established OpenMP language extensions to newer C++ features like smart pointers. To properly use these abstractions in an existing codebase, programmers must determine how a given source code region interacts with Program State Elements (PSEs) (i.e., the program's variables and memory locations). We call this process Program State Element Characterization (PSEC). Without tool support for PSEC, a programmer's only option is to manually study the entire codebase. We propose a profile-based approach that automates PSEC and provides abstraction recommendations to programmers. Because a profile-based approach incurs an impractical overhead, we introduce the Compiler and Runtime Memory Observation Tool (CARMOT), a PSEC-specific compiler co-designed with a parallel runtime. CARMOT reduces the overhead of PSEC by two orders of magnitude, making PSEC practical. We show that CARMOT's recommendations achieve the same speedup as hand-tuned OpenMP directives and avoid memory leaks with C++ smart pointers. From this, we argue that PSEC tools, such as CARMOT, can provide support for the rich ecosystem of modern programming language abstractions.  

 SESSION: Neural Network Accelerators  
 Flexer: Out-of-Order Scheduling for Multi-NPUs   
 Hyemi Min 
  Jungyoon Kwon 
  Bernhard Egger 
  Recent neural accelerators often comprise multiple neural processing units (NPUs) with shared cache and memory. The regular schedules of state-of-the-art scheduling techniques miss important opportunities for memory reuse. This paper presents Flexer, an out-of-order (OoO) scheduler that maximizes instruction-level parallelism and data reuse on such multi-NPU systems. Flexer employs a list scheduling algorithm to dynamically schedule the tiled workload to all NPUs. To cope with the irregular data access patterns of OoO schedules, several heuristics help maximize data reuse by considering the availability of data tiles at different levels in the memory hierarchy. Evaluated with several neural networks on 2 to 4-core multi-NPUs, Flexer achieves a speedup of up to 2.2x and a 1.2-fold reduction in data transfers for individual layers compared to the best static execution order.  

 Pin or Fuse? Exploiting Scratchpad Memory to Reduce Off-Chip Data Transfer in DNN Accelerators   
 Hyuk-Jin Jeong 
  JiHwan Yeo 
  Cheongyo Bahk 
  JongHyun Park 
  Growing interests in on-device AI have led to the proliferation of accelerators dedicated to neural network inference. Most ASIC accelerators are equipped with compiler-controlled scratchpad memory (SPM) used as a last-level cache to reduce the number of accesses to off-chip memory. A widely-used strategy for utilizing SPM is fused-layer execution, which divides a DNN model into groups of layers and forwards the intermediate results within each group without eviction to the off-chip memory. However, layer fusion has an inherent limitation that the fusion of consecutive layers increases the amount of computations, leading to sub-optimal performance.  
 This paper introduces a new dimension to SPM usage, which temporarily pins a feature map on SPM. Pinning reduces off-chip transfer without computation increase, but it is not applicable to all feature maps due to limited SPM size. We find that superior performance can be achieved by combination of pinning and fusion in MobileNet. Based on this observation, we propose a model-level optimization method that jointly applies pinning and fusion to minimize inference latency under memory constraints. Scheduling and allocation schemes are presented for automatic generation of optimized codes. Evaluation on the commercial AI accelerator shows that the proposed method reduces off-chip transfer of feature maps by 50% and improves inference latency by 15% on average without additional hardware, compared to the state-of-the-art fusion approach.

  Neural processing units (NPUs) have become indispensable parts of mobile SoCs. Furthermore, integrating multiple NPU cores into a single chip becomes a promising solution for ever-increasing computing power demands in mobile devices. This paper addresses techniques to maximize the utilization of NPU cores and reduce the latency of on-device inference. Mobile NPUs typically have a small amount of local memory (or scratch pad memory, SPM) that provides space only enough for input/output tensors and weights of one layer operation in deep neural networks (DNNs). Even in multicore NPUs, such local memories are distributed across the cores. In such systems, executing network layer operations in parallel is the primary vehicle to achieve performance. By partitioning a layer of DNNs into multiple sub-layers, we can execute them in parallel on multicore NPUs. Within a core, we can also employ pipelined execution to reduce the execution time of a sub-layer. In this execution model, synchronizing parallel execution and loading/storing intermediate tensors in global memory are the main bottlenecks. To alleviate these problems, we propose novel optimization techniques which carefully consider partitioning direction, execution order, synchronization, and global memory access. Using six popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we evaluate our optimization techniques in a flagship mobile SoC with three cores. Compared to the highest-performing partitioning approach, our techniques improve performance by 23%, achieving a speedup of 2.1x over single-core systems.  

 PIMFlow: Compiler and Runtime Support for CNN Models on Processing-in-Memory DRAM   
 Yongwon Shin 
  Juseong Park

  Hyojin Sung 
  Processing-in-Memory (PIM) has evolved over decades into a feasible solution to addressing the exacerbating performance bottleneck with main memory by placing computational logic in or near memory. Recent proposals from DRAM manufacturers highlighted the HW constraint-aware design of PIM-enabled DRAM with specialized MAC logic, providing an order of magnitude speedup for memory-intensive operations in DL models. Although the main target for PIM acceleration did not initially include convolutional neural networks due to their high compute intensity, recent CNN models are increasingly adopting computationally lightweight implementation. Motivated by the potential for the software stack to enable CNN models on DRAM-PIM hardware without invasive changes, we propose PIMFlow, an end-to-end compiler and runtime support, to accelerate CNN models on a PIM-enabled GPU memory. PIMFlow transforms model graphs to create inter-node parallelism across GPU and PIM, explores possible task- and data-parallel execution scenarios for optimal execution time, and provides a code-generating back-end and execution engine for DRAM-PIM. PIMFlow achieves up to 82% end-to-end speedup and reduces energy consumption by 26% on average for CNN model inferences.

 CfP: ISCO 2022 – International Symposium on Combinatorial Optimization  
 2022-02-01    ~  patrickhirsch      
  
 ISCO (International Symposium on Combinatorial Optimization) is a biennial symposium whose aim is to bring together researchers from all the communities related to combinatorial optimization, including algorithms and complexity, mathematical programming, operations research, optimization under uncertainty, graphs and combinatorics. It is intended to be a forum for presenting original research in these areas and especially in their intersections. Quality papers on all aspects of combinatorial optimization, from mathematical foundations and theory of algorithms to computational studies and practical applications, are solicited.  
 ISCO 2022 will be held online (May 18-20, 2022) and will be preceded by a Spring School (May 16-17, 2022) given by Giacomo Nannicini on „Mathematical Optimization and Quantum Algorithms“  which is dedicated to PhD students but the lectures are also open to other colleagues.  
 Conference website: https://isco2022.sciencesconf.org/   
 SUBMISSIONS and PUBLICATIONS:  
  There are two types of submissions:  
  – Regular papers up to 12 pages. The post-conference proceedings will be published by Springer (LNCS series). For an accepted paper to be included in the proceedings, it should be presented at the conference by one of the authors. The authors of accepted papers will have to prepare their camera-ready version two weeks after the end of the conference. More information about the submission procedure will be available in the web site of the conference in due time.  
  – Extended abstracts up to 3 pages. Accepted abstracts will be published online on the conference website (and will not be included in the post-conference proceedings).

 Code of Conduct  
 SoCG is dedicated to providing an environment that is free from harassment, bullying, discrimination, and retaliation for all participants. All attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the CG Week code of conduct.  
 If an author has a conflict of such nature with a potential reviewer, and the author has sufficient grounds to believe that the review would be negatively biased, then the author is asked to declare this conflict in HotCRP. You are also welcome to contact a SoCG SafeTOC advocate who will treat any supporting information confidentially. For a list of SoCG advocates with contact information, please refer to CG Week Code of Conduct  .  
 Submission Guidlines  
 Paper types | When writing or evaluating a SoCG paper, it is important to keep in mind that there are different types of contributions, each with its own strengths. To ensure that a submission is evaluated on its own merits, authors will need to identify the main strengths of their submission, as captured by four possible paper types. PC members and external reviewers will be asked to take into account these paper types together with their associated evaluation criteria when they evaluate a paper. There are no quotas for the paper types and submissions can be labeled with more than one paper type at the time of submission. 
  Mathematical Foundations | : A typical paper will contain theorems and proofs describing new results in discrete or combinatorial geometry, discrete differential geometry or topology, or in topological combinatorics. The paper will primarily be evaluated on its technical depth, the importance of the results, the elegance of the solution, the connection of the problem studied to computational geometry and topology, and the potential future impact on algorithm development. 
  Algorithmic Complexity | : A typical paper will contain algorithms, data structures, theorems, proofs, or lower bound constructions describing new results on computational geometry problems. The paper will primarily be evaluated on the (mathematical or computational) relevance and importance of the problem studied, its technical depth, the elegance of the solution, and the potential future impact of the results or the proposed new methods and techniques. 
  Experiments and Implementation | : A typical paper will make a clear contribution to the implementation and evaluation of geometric algorithms, such as exact, approximate, or algebraic computation, algorithms engineering, or the experimental evaluation of competing algorithmic approaches. The paper will primarily be evaluated on the completeness and the expected impact of the proposed implementation, the soundness of the experiments, the quality and quantity of testing, and on the general amount of knowledge gained. 
  Applications | : A typical paper will describe the modeling and algorithmic choices made when developing or adapting computational geometry techniques for an application area. The paper will be primarily evaluated on the soundness of the modeling decisions, the ingenuity of the solution, the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the expected impact in the application area. One might also consider the lesson learned regarding the applicability or suitability of computational geometry tools to the specific area. 
  Double Blind and PC submissions | For the first time, this year's SoCG will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process, and will allow PC members (other than the PC chairs) to submit to the conference as well. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors' names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work is in the third person (e.g., not "We build on our previous work ..." but rather "We build on the work of ..."). Particular care needs to be taken if there is any accompanying software or data, which needs to be linked anonymously (for example, via a DropBox folder or | Anonymous GitHub | , perhaps with a subset of synthetic data if the real data is not anonymized). Upon registering a submission, the authors will declare conflicts of interest with PC members, as well as listing email address or domain level conflicts (i.e. “Erin Chambers (Saint Louis University)”, “All (University of Sydney)”.) of other professional or personal conflicts. The purpose of lightweight double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. We encourage authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing to contact the PC chairs, or to see the more detailed discussion in the | proposal | that preceded the vote to move to double blind: https://computational-geometry.org/documents/Double_blind_proposal.pdf 
  Format | Submissions must be formatted in accordance with the | LIPIcs proceedings guidelines | . Authors must use the new LaTeX class file | socg-lipics-v2021.cls | (version 0.9), with the option “anonymous”; note that the cls file is a wrapper around the standard LIPIcs class. The LIPIcs style and instructions are available | here | ; the class file is available | here | , and instructions on how to use it are available | here | . Submissions must not exceed 500 lines, excluding front matter (title), references, and a clearly marked appendix (further described below), but including all other lines (in abstract, algorithms, tables, captions, etc.). The class files provide line counting which should be accurate in most cases. Authors should refrain from putting excessive amounts of text in parts in which lines are not counted automatically. If authors need constructs that contain uncounted lines of text, they should compensate for this by reducing the final line count accordingly. It is the sole responsibility of the authors not to exceed 500 lines even if some lines are not counted automatically. 
  Contents of the submission | Papers should be submitted in the form of an extended abstract, which begins with the title of the paper, as well as a short abstract. This should be followed by the main body of the paper that begins with a precise statement of the problem considered, a succinct summary of the results obtained (emphasizing the significance, novelty, and potential impact of the research), and a clear comparison with related work. The remainder of the extended abstract should provide sufficient details to allow the program committee to evaluate the validity, quality, and relevance of the contribution. Clarity of presentation is very important; the entire extended abstract should be written carefully, taking into consideration that it will be read and evaluated by both experts and non-experts, often under tight time constraints. 
  Appendix and additional data | All details needed to verify the results must be provided. Supporting materials, including proofs of theoretical claims and experimental details, that do not fit in the 500-line limit should be given in an appendix. If more appropriate, the full version may be given as the appendix. In both cases, however, the authors should include in the main part specific pointers to the relevant locations in the appendix. The appendix will be read by the program committee members and subreviewers at their discretion and will not be published as part of the proceedings. Thus, the paper without the appendix should be able to stand on its own. Experimental and implementation results (independent of paper type) must be reproducible and verifiable. Authors of all types of papers are encouraged to put accompanying software and relevant data, if there are any, in a repository accessible to the reviewers. Authors are asked to indicate which of the supporting materials will remain publicly available if their papers are accepted. 
  Previous or simultaneous submission | Previous or simultaneous submissions Results previously published or accepted for publication in the proceedings of another conference cannot be submitted. Simultaneous submissions of the results to another conference with published proceedings are not allowed. Exempted are workshops and conferences without formal proceedings, but possibly with handouts containing short abstracts. In particular, submissions of papers that have appeared or will be submitted to EuroCG are allowed, since EuroCG does not publish formal proceedings, while submissions of papers that have appeared in CCCG are not allowed. Results that have already been accepted (with or without revision) for publication in a journal at the time of their submission to the symposium are not allowed. 
  Strict guidelines | Submissions deviating from the above guidelines risk being rejected without further consideration. 
  Guidelines for reviewers | The guidelines are available | here | . 
  Accepted Papers  
 Presentation, awards, and special issues | An author of each accepted paper will be expected to attend the symposium and present the paper (approximately 20 minutes). Given the developing COVID-19 pandemic, the format of both attendance and presentation will be clarified closer to the event. Awards will be given for the best paper and for the best student presentation. Authors of a selection of papers from the symposium will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers to special issues of | Discrete & Computational Geometry | and | Journal of Computational Geometry | . As in the previous years, the authors of the best paper will be invited to submit an extended version of their paper to | Journal of the ACM | . 
  Format | Final proceedings versions of accepted papers must respect the same formatting constraints as the submissions ( | LIPIcs proceedings format | with | socg-lipics-v2021 | ; 500-line limit, excluding front matter and references), but must not comprise any appendix. If any supporting material (including complete proofs of theoretical claims and experimental details) does not fit in the specified limit, then the full version of the paper containing this information must be referenced in the conference version and made available at a public repository, such as | arXiv | , by the time the final version is submitted. Where applicable, we encourage the authors to make accompanying software and/or data publicly accessible, with proper references in the paper.

 Geometric Embeddability of Complexes Is ∃ℝ-Complete   
 Authors:  Mikkel Abrahamsen, Linda Kleist, and Tillmann Miltzow  
  Abstract    
 We show that the decision problem of determining whether a given (abstract simplicial) k-complex has a geometric embedding in ℝ^d is complete for the Existential Theory of the Reals for all d ≥ 3 and k ∈ {d-1,d}. Consequently, the problem is polynomial time equivalent to determining whether a polynomial equation system has a real solution and other important problems from various fields related to packing, Nash equilibria, minimum convex covers, the Art Gallery Problem, continuous constraint satisfaction problems, and training neural networks. Moreover, this implies NP-hardness and constitutes the first hardness result for the algorithmic problem of geometric embedding (abstract simplicial) complexes. This complements recent breakthroughs for the computational complexity of piece-wise linear embeddability.

 Distinguishing Classes of Intersection Graphs of Homothets or Similarities of Two Convex Disks   
 Authors:  Mikkel Abrahamsen and Bartosz Walczak  
  Abstract    
 For smooth convex disks A, i.e., convex compact subsets of the plane with non-empty interior, we classify the classes G^{hom}(A) and G^{sim}(A) of intersection graphs that can be obtained from homothets and similarities of A, respectively. Namely, we prove that G^{hom}(A) = G^{hom}(B) if and only if A and B are affine equivalent, and G^{sim}(A) = G^{sim}(B) if and only if A and B are similar.

 Lower Bounds for Intersection Reporting Among Flat Objects   
 Authors:  Peyman Afshani and Pingan Cheng  
  Abstract    
 Recently, Ezra and Sharir [Esther Ezra and Micha Sharir, 2022] showed an O(n^{3/2+σ}) space and O(n^{1/2+σ}) query time data structure for ray shooting among triangles in ℝ³. This improves the upper bound given by the classical S(n)Q(n)⁴ = O(n^{4+σ}) space-time tradeoff for the first time in almost 25 years and in fact lies on the tradeoff curve of S(n)Q(n)³ = O(n^{3+σ}). However, it seems difficult to apply their techniques beyond this specific space and time combination. This pheonomenon appears persistently in almost all recent advances of flat object intersection searching, e.g., line-tetrahedron intersection in ℝ⁴ [Esther Ezra and Micha Sharir, 2022], triangle-triangle intersection in ℝ⁴ [Esther Ezra and Micha Sharir, 2022], or even among flat semialgebraic objects [Agarwal et al., 2022]. We give a timely explanation to this phenomenon from a lower bound perspective. We prove that given a set 𝒮 of (d-1)-dimensional simplicies in ℝ^d, any data structure that can report all intersections with a query line in small (n^o(1)) query time must use Ω(n^{2(d-1)-o(1)}) space. This dashes the hope of any significant improvement to the tradeoff curves for small query time and almost matches the classical upper bound. We also obtain an almost matching space lower bound of Ω(n^{6-o(1)}) for triangle-triangle intersection reporting in ℝ⁴ when the query time is small. Along the way, we further develop the previous lower bound techniques by Afshani and Cheng [Afshani and Cheng, 2021; Afshani and Cheng, 2022].

 Computing Instance-Optimal Kernels in Two Dimensions   
 Authors:  Pankaj K. Agarwal and Sariel Har-Peled  
  Abstract    
 Let P be a set of n points in ℝ². For a parameter ε ∈ (0,1), a subset C ⊆ P is an ε-kernel of P if the projection of the convex hull of C approximates that of P within (1-ε)-factor in every direction. The set C is a weak ε-kernel of P if its directional width approximates that of P in every direction. Let 𝗄_ε(P) (resp. 𝗄^𝗐_ε(P)) denote the minimum-size of an ε-kernel (resp. weak ε-kernel) of P. We present an O(n 𝗄_ε(P)log n)-time algorithm for computing an ε-kernel of P of size 𝗄_ε(P), and an O(n²log n)-time algorithm for computing a weak ε-kernel of P of size 𝗄^𝗐_ε(P). We also present a fast algorithm for the Hausdorff variant of this problem. In addition, we introduce the notion of ε-core, a convex polygon lying inside ch(P), prove that it is a good approximation of the optimal ε-kernel, present an efficient algorithm for computing it, and use it to compute an ε-kernel of small size.

 Line Intersection Searching Amid Unit Balls in 3-Space   
 Authors:  Pankaj K. Agarwal and Esther Ezra  
  Abstract    
 Let ℬ be a set of n unit balls in ℝ³. We present a linear-size data structure for storing ℬ that can determine in O^*(n^{1/2}) time whether a query line intersects any ball of ℬ and report all k such balls in additional O(k) time. The data structure can be constructed in O(n log n) time. (The O^*(⋅) notation hides subpolynomial factors, e.g., of the form O(n^ε), for arbitrarily small ε > 0, and their coefficients which depend on ε.) We also consider the dual problem: Let ℒ be a set of n lines in ℝ³. We preprocess ℒ, in O^*(n²) time, into a data structure of size O^*(n²) that can determine in O^*(1) time whether a query unit ball intersects any line of ℒ, or report all k such lines in additional O(k) time.

 Drawings of Complete Multipartite Graphs up to Triangle Flips   
 Authors:  Oswin Aichholzer, Man-Kwun Chiu, Hung P. Hoang, Michael Hoffmann, Jan Kynčl, Yannic Maus, Birgit Vogtenhuber, and Alexandra Weinberger  
  Abstract    
 For a drawing of a labeled graph, the rotation of a vertex or crossing is the cyclic order of its incident edges, represented by the labels of their other endpoints. The extended rotation system (ERS) of the drawing is the collection of the rotations of all vertices and crossings. A drawing is simple if each pair of edges has at most one common point. Gioan’s Theorem states that for any two simple drawings of the complete graph K_n with the same crossing edge pairs, one drawing can be transformed into the other by a sequence of triangle flips (a.k.a. Reidemeister moves of Type 3). This operation refers to the act of moving one edge of a triangular cell formed by three pairwise crossing edges over the opposite crossing of the cell, via a local transformation. We investigate to what extent Gioan-type theorems can be obtained for wider classes of graphs. A necessary (but in general not sufficient) condition for two drawings of a graph to be transformable into each other by a sequence of triangle flips is that they have the same ERS. As our main result, we show that for the large class of complete multipartite graphs, this necessary condition is in fact also sufficient. We present two different proofs of this result, one of which is shorter, while the other one yields a polynomial time algorithm for which the number of needed triangle flips for graphs on n vertices is bounded by O(n^{16}). The latter proof uses a Carathéodory-type theorem for simple drawings of complete multipartite graphs, which we believe to be of independent interest. Moreover, we show that our Gioan-type theorem for complete multipartite graphs is essentially tight in the following sense: For the complete bipartite graph K_{m,n} minus two edges and K_{m,n} plus one edge for any m,n ≥ 4, as well as K_n minus a 4-cycle for any n ≥ 5, there exist two simple drawings with the same ERS that cannot be transformed into each other using triangle flips. So having the same ERS does not remain sufficient when removing or adding very few edges.

 Decomposition of Zero-Dimensional Persistence Modules via Rooted Subsets   
 Authors:  Ángel Javier Alonso and Michael Kerber  
  Abstract    
 We study the decomposition of zero-dimensional persistence modules, viewed as functors valued in the category of vector spaces factorizing through sets. Instead of working directly at the level of vector spaces, we take a step back and first study the decomposition problem at the level of sets. This approach allows us to define the combinatorial notion of rooted subsets. In the case of a filtered metric space M, rooted subsets relate the clustering behavior of the points of M with the decomposition of the associated persistence module. In particular, we can identify intervals in such a decomposition quickly. In addition, rooted subsets can be understood as a generalization of the elder rule, and are also related to the notion of constant conqueror of Cai, Kim, Mémoli and Wang. As an application, we give a lower bound on the number of intervals that we can expect in the decomposition of zero-dimensional persistence modules of a density-Rips filtration in Euclidean space: in the limit, and under very general circumstances, we can expect that at least 25% of the indecomposable summands are interval modules.

 On Helly Numbers of Exponential Lattices   
 Authors:  Gergely Ambrus, Martin Balko, Nóra Frankl, Attila Jung, and Márton Naszódi  
  Abstract    
 Given a set S ⊆ ℝ², define the Helly number of S, denoted by H(S), as the smallest positive integer N, if it exists, for which the following statement is true: for any finite family ℱ of convex sets in ℝ² such that the intersection of any N or fewer members of ℱ contains at least one point of S, there is a point of S common to all members of ℱ. We prove that the Helly numbers of exponential lattices {αⁿ : n ∈ ℕ₀}² are finite for every α > 1 and we determine their exact values in some instances. In particular, we obtain H({2ⁿ : n ∈ ℕ₀}²) = 5, solving a problem posed by Dillon (2021). For real numbers α, β > 1, we also fully characterize exponential lattices L(α,β) = {αⁿ : n ∈ ℕ₀} × {βⁿ : n ∈ ℕ₀} with finite Helly numbers by showing that H(L(α,β)) is finite if and only if log_α(β) is rational.

 Optimal Volume-Sensitive Bounds for Polytope Approximation   
 Authors:  Sunil Arya and David M. Mount  
  Abstract    
 Approximating convex bodies is a fundamental question in geometry and has a wide variety of applications. Consider a convex body K of diameter Δ in ℝ^d for fixed d. The objective is to minimize the number of vertices (alternatively, the number of facets) of an approximating polytope for a given Hausdorff error ε. It is known from classical results of Dudley (1974) and Bronshteyn and Ivanov (1976) that Θ((Δ/ε)^{(d-1)/2}) vertices (alternatively, facets) are both necessary and sufficient. While this bound is tight in the worst case, that of Euclidean balls, it is far from optimal for skinny convex bodies. A natural way to characterize a convex object’s skinniness is in terms of its relationship to the Euclidean ball. Given a convex body K, define its volume diameter Δ_d to be the diameter of a Euclidean ball of the same volume as K, and define its surface diameter Δ_{d-1} analogously for surface area. It follows from generalizations of the isoperimetric inequality that Δ ≥ Δ_{d-1} ≥ Δ_d. Arya, da Fonseca, and Mount (SoCG 2012) demonstrated that the diameter-based bound could be made surface-area sensitive, improving the above bound to O((Δ_{d-1}/ε)^{(d-1)/2}). In this paper, we strengthen this by proving the existence of an approximation with O((Δ_d/ε)^{(d-1)/2}) facets. This improvement is a result of the combination of a number of new ideas. As in prior work, we exploit properties of the original body and its polar dual. In order to obtain a volume-sensitive bound, we explore the following more general problem. Given two convex bodies, one nested within the other, find a low-complexity convex polytope that is sandwiched between them. We show that this problem can be reduced to a covering problem involving a natural intermediate body based on the harmonic mean. Our proof relies on a geometric analysis of a relative notion of fatness involving these bodies.

 Coresets for Clustering in Geometric Intersection Graphs   
 Authors:  Sayan Bandyapadhyay, Fedor V. Fomin, and Tanmay Inamdar  
  Abstract    
 Designing coresets - small-space sketches of the data preserving cost of the solutions within (1± ε)-approximate factor - is an important research direction in the study of center-based k-clustering problems, such as k-means or k-median. Feldman and Langberg [STOC'11] have shown that for k-clustering of n points in general metrics, it is possible to obtain coresets whose size depends logarithmically in n. Moreover, such a dependency in n is inevitable in general metrics. A significant amount of recent work in the area is devoted to obtaining coresests whose sizes are independent of n for special metrics, like d-dimensional Euclidean space [Huang, Vishnoi, STOC'20], doubling metrics [Huang, Jiang, Li, Wu, FOCS'18], metrics of graphs of bounded treewidth [Baker, Braverman, Huang, Jiang, Krauthgamer, Wu, ICML’20], or graphs excluding a fixed minor [Braverman, Jiang, Krauthgamer, Wu, SODA’21]. In this paper, we provide the first constructions of coresets whose size does not depend on n for k-clustering in the metrics induced by geometric intersection graphs. For example, we obtain (k log²k)/ε^𝒪(1) size coresets for k-clustering in Euclidean-weighted unit-disk graphs (UDGs) and unit-square graphs (USGs). These constructions follow from a general theorem that identifies two canonical properties of a graph metric sufficient for obtaining coresets whose size is independent of n. The proof of our theorem builds on the recent work of Cohen-Addad, Saulpic, and Schwiegelshohn [STOC '21], which ensures small-sized coresets conditioned on the existence of an interesting set of centers, called centroid set. The main technical contribution of our work is the proof of the existence of such a small-sized centroid set for graphs that satisfy the two canonical properties. Loosely speaking, the metrics of geometric intersection graphs are "similar" to the Euclidean metrics for points that are close, and to the shortest path metrics of planar graphs for points that are far apart. The main technical challenge in constructing centroid sets of small sizes is in combining these two very different metrics. The new coreset construction helps to design the first (1+ε)-approximation for center-based clustering problems in UDGs and USGs, that is fixed-parameter tractable in k and ε (FPT-AS).

 Minimum-Membership Geometric Set Cover, Revisited   
 Authors:  Sayan Bandyapadhyay, William Lochet, Saket Saurabh, and Jie Xue  
  Abstract    
 We revisit a natural variant of the geometric set cover problem, called minimum-membership geometric set cover (MMGSC). In this problem, the input consists of a set S of points and a set ℛ of geometric objects, and the goal is to find a subset ℛ^* ⊆ ℛ to cover all points in S such that the membership of S with respect to ℛ^*, denoted by memb(S,ℛ^*), is minimized, where memb(S,ℛ^*) = max_{p ∈ S} |{R ∈ ℛ^*: p ∈ R}|. We give the first polynomial-time approximation algorithms for MMGSC in ℝ². Specifically, we achieve the following two main results. - We give the first polynomial-time constant-approximation algorithm for MMGSC with unit squares. This answers a question left open since the work of Erlebach and Leeuwen [SODA'08], who gave a constant-approximation algorithm with running time n^{O(opt)} where opt is the optimum of the problem (i.e., the minimum membership). - We give the first polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for MMGSC with halfplanes. Prior to this work, it was even unknown whether the problem can be approximated with a factor of o(log n) in polynomial time, while it is well-known that the minimum-size set cover problem with halfplanes can be solved in polynomial time. We also consider a problem closely related to MMGSC, called minimum-ply geometric set cover (MPGSC), in which the goal is to find ℛ^* ⊆ ℛ to cover S such that the ply of ℛ^* is minimized, where the ply is defined as the maximum number of objects in ℛ^* which have a nonempty common intersection. Very recently, Durocher et al. gave the first constant-approximation algorithm for MPGSC with unit squares which runs in O(n^{12}) time. We give a significantly simpler constant-approximation algorithm with near-linear running time.

 FPT Constant-Approximations for Capacitated Clustering to Minimize the Sum of Cluster Radii   
 Authors:  Sayan Bandyapadhyay, William Lochet, and Saket Saurabh  
  Abstract    
 Clustering with capacity constraints is a fundamental problem that attracted significant attention throughout the years. In this paper, we give the first FPT constant-factor approximation algorithm for the problem of clustering points in a general metric into k clusters to minimize the sum of cluster radii, subject to non-uniform hard capacity constraints (Capacitated Sum of Radii ). In particular, we give a (15+ε)-approximation algorithm that runs in 2^𝒪(k²log k) ⋅ n³ time. When capacities are uniform, we obtain the following improved approximation bounds. - A (4 + ε)-approximation with running time 2^𝒪(klog(k/ε)) n³, which significantly improves over the FPT 28-approximation of Inamdar and Varadarajan [ESA 2020]. - A (2 + ε)-approximation with running time 2^𝒪(k/ε² ⋅log(k/ε)) dn³ and a (1+ε)-approxim- ation with running time 2^𝒪(kdlog ((k/ε))) n³ in the Euclidean space. Here d is the dimension. - A (1 + ε)-approximation in the Euclidean space with running time 2^𝒪(k/ε² ⋅log(k/ε)) dn³ if we are allowed to violate the capacities by (1 + ε)-factor. We complement this result by showing that there is no (1 + ε)-approximation algorithm running in time f(k)⋅ n^𝒪(1), if any capacity violation is not allowed.

 Multilevel Skeletonization Using Local Separators   
 Authors:  J. Andreas Bærentzen, Rasmus Emil Christensen, Emil Toftegaard Gæde, and Eva Rotenberg  
  Abstract    
 In this paper we give a new, efficient algorithm for computing curve skeletons, based on local separators. Our efficiency stems from a multilevel approach, where we solve small problems across levels of detail and combine these in order to quickly obtain a skeleton. We do this in a highly modular fashion, ensuring complete flexibility in adapting the algorithm for specific types of input or for otherwise targeting specific applications. Separator based skeletonization was first proposed by Bærentzen and Rotenberg in [ACM Tran. Graphics'21], showing high quality output at the cost of running times which become prohibitive for large inputs. Our new approach retains the high quality output, and applicability to any spatially embedded graph, while being orders of magnitude faster for all practical purposes. We test our skeletonization algorithm for efficiency and quality in practice, comparing it to local separator skeletonization on the University of Groningen Skeletonization Benchmark [Telea'16].

 Efficient Computation of Image Persistence   
 Authors:  Ulrich Bauer and Maximilian Schmahl  
  Abstract    
 We present an algorithm for computing the barcode of the image of a morphism in persistent homology induced by an inclusion of filtered finite-dimensional chain complexes. The algorithm makes use of the clearing optimization and can be applied to inclusion-induced maps in persistent absolute homology and persistent relative cohomology for filtrations of pairs of simplicial complexes. The clearing optimization works particularly well in the context of relative cohomology, and using previous duality results we can translate the barcodes of images in relative cohomology to those in absolute homology. This forms the basis for an implementation of image persistence computations for inclusions of filtrations of Vietoris-Rips complexes in the framework of the software Ripser.

 Efficient Two-Parameter Persistence Computation via Cohomology   
 Authors:  Ulrich Bauer, Fabian Lenzen, and Michael Lesnick  
  Abstract    
 Clearing is a simple but effective optimization for the standard algorithm of persistent homology (ph), which dramatically improves the speed and scalability of ph computations for Vietoris-Rips filtrations. Due to the quick growth of the boundary matrices of a Vietoris-Rips filtration with increasing dimension, clearing is only effective when used in conjunction with a dual (cohomological) variant of the standard algorithm. This approach has not previously been applied successfully to the computation of two-parameter ph. We introduce a cohomological algorithm for computing minimal free resolutions of two-parameter ph that allows for clearing. To derive our algorithm, we extend the duality principles which underlie the one-parameter approach to the two-parameter setting. We provide an implementation and report experimental run times for function-Rips filtrations. Our method is faster than the current state-of-the-art by a factor of up to 20.

 The Complexity of Geodesic Spanners   
 Authors:  Sarita de Berg, Marc van Kreveld, and Frank Staals  
  Abstract    
 A geometric t-spanner for a set S of n point sites is an edge-weighted graph for which the (weighted) distance between any two sites p,q ∈ S is at most t times the original distance between p and q. We study geometric t-spanners for point sets in a constrained two-dimensional environment P. In such cases, the edges of the spanner may have non-constant complexity. Hence, we introduce a novel spanner property: the spanner complexity, that is, the total complexity of all edges in the spanner. Let S be a set of n point sites in a simple polygon P with m vertices. We present an algorithm to construct, for any constant ε > 0 and fixed integer k ≥ 1, a (2k + ε)-spanner with complexity O(mn^{1/k} + nlog² n) in O(nlog²n + mlog n + K) time, where K denotes the output complexity. When we consider sites in a polygonal domain P with holes, we can construct such a (2k+ε)-spanner of similar complexity in O(n² log m + nmlog m + K) time. Additionally, for any constant ε ∈ (0,1) and integer constant t ≥ 2, we show a lower bound for the complexity of any (t-ε)-spanner of Ω(mn^{1/(t-1)} + n).

 An Extension Theorem for Signotopes   
 Authors:  Helena Bergold, Stefan Felsner, and Manfred Scheucher  
  Abstract    
 In 1926, Levi showed that, for every pseudoline arrangement 𝒜 and two points in the plane, 𝒜 can be extended by a pseudoline which contains the two prescribed points. Later extendability was studied for arrangements of pseudohyperplanes in higher dimensions. While the extendability of an arrangement of proper hyperplanes in ℝ^d with a hyperplane containing d prescribed points is trivial, Richter-Gebert found an arrangement of pseudoplanes in ℝ³ which cannot be extended with a pseudoplane containing two particular prescribed points. In this article, we investigate the extendability of signotopes, which are a combinatorial structure encoding a rich subclass of pseudohyperplane arrangements. Our main result is that signotopes of odd rank are extendable in the sense that for two prescribed crossing points we can add an element containing them. Moreover, we conjecture that in all even ranks r ≥ 4 there exist signotopes which are not extendable for two prescribed points. Our conjecture is supported by examples in ranks 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 that were found with a SAT based approach.

 Extending Orthogonal Planar Graph Drawings Is Fixed-Parameter Tractable   
 Authors:  Sujoy Bhore, Robert Ganian, Liana Khazaliya, Fabrizio Montecchiani, and Martin Nöllenburg  
  Abstract    
 The task of finding an extension to a given partial drawing of a graph while adhering to constraints on the representation has been extensively studied in the literature, with well-known results providing efficient algorithms for fundamental representations such as planar and beyond-planar topological drawings. In this paper, we consider the extension problem for bend-minimal orthogonal drawings of planar graphs, which is among the most fundamental geometric graph drawing representations. While the problem was known to be NP-hard, it is natural to consider the case where only a small part of the graph is still to be drawn. Here, we establish the fixed-parameter tractability of the problem when parameterized by the size of the missing subgraph. Our algorithm is based on multiple novel ingredients which intertwine geometric and combinatorial arguments. These include the identification of a new graph representation of bend-equivalent regions for vertex placement in the plane, establishing a bound on the treewidth of this auxiliary graph, and a global point-grid that allows us to discretize the possible placement of bends and vertices into locally bounded subgrids for each of the above regions.

 Improved Bounds for Covering Paths and Trees in the Plane   
 Authors:  Ahmad Biniaz  
  Abstract    
 A covering path for a planar point set is a path drawn in the plane with straight-line edges such that every point lies at a vertex or on an edge of the path. A covering tree is defined analogously. Let π(n) be the minimum number such that every set of n points in the plane can be covered by a noncrossing path with at most π(n) edges. Let τ(n) be the analogous number for noncrossing covering trees. Dumitrescu, Gerbner, Keszegh, and Tóth (Discrete & Computational Geometry, 2014) established the following inequalities: 5n/9 - O(1) < π(n) < (1-1/601080391)n, and 9n/17 - O(1) < τ(n) ⩽ ⌊5n/6⌋. We report the following improved upper bounds: π(n) ⩽ (1-1/22)n, and τ(n) ⩽ ⌈4n/5⌉. In the same context we study rainbow polygons. For a set of colored points in the plane, a perfect rainbow polygon is a simple polygon that contains exactly one point of each color in its interior or on its boundary. Let ρ(k) be the minimum number such that every k-colored point set in the plane admits a perfect rainbow polygon of size ρ(k). Flores-Peñaloza, Kano, Martínez-Sandoval, Orden, Tejel, Tóth, Urrutia, and Vogtenhuber (Discrete Mathematics, 2021) proved that 20k/19 - O(1) < ρ(k) < 10k/7 + O(1). We report the improved upper bound of ρ(k) < 7k/5 + O(1). To obtain the improved bounds we present simple O(nlog n)-time algorithms that achieve paths, trees, and polygons with our desired number of edges.

 Sparse Higher Order Čech Filtrations   
 Authors:  Mickaël Buchet, Bianca B. Dornelas, and Michael Kerber  
  Abstract    
 For a finite set of balls of radius r, the k-fold cover is the space covered by at least k balls. Fixing the ball centers and varying the radius, we obtain a nested sequence of spaces that is called the k-fold filtration of the centers. For k = 1, the construction is the union-of-balls filtration that is popular in topological data analysis. For larger k, it yields a cleaner shape reconstruction in the presence of outliers. We contribute a sparsification algorithm to approximate the topology of the k-fold filtration. Our method is a combination and adaptation of several techniques from the well-studied case k = 1, resulting in a sparsification of linear size that can be computed in expected near-linear time with respect to the number of input points.

 Finding Large Counterexamples by Selectively Exploring the Pachner Graph   
 Authors:  Benjamin A. Burton and Alexander He  
  Abstract    
 We often rely on censuses of triangulations to guide our intuition in 3-manifold topology. However, this can lead to misplaced faith in conjectures if the smallest counterexamples are too large to appear in our census. Since the number of triangulations increases super-exponentially with size, there is no way to expand a census beyond relatively small triangulations - the current census only goes up to 10 tetrahedra. Here, we show that it is feasible to search for large and hard-to-find counterexamples by using heuristics to selectively (rather than exhaustively) enumerate triangulations. We use this idea to find counterexamples to three conjectures which ask, for certain 3-manifolds, whether one-vertex triangulations always have a "distinctive" edge that would allow us to recognise the 3-manifold.

 Improved Algebraic Degeneracy Testing   
 Authors:  Jean Cardinal and Micha Sharir  
  Abstract    
 In the classical linear degeneracy testing problem, we are given n real numbers and a k-variate linear polynomial F, for some constant k, and have to determine whether there exist k numbers a_1,…,a_k from the set such that F(a_1,…,a_k) = 0. We consider a generalization of this problem in which F is an arbitrary constant-degree polynomial, we are given k sets of n real numbers, and have to determine whether there exists a k-tuple of numbers, one in each set, on which F vanishes. We give the first improvement over the naïve O^*(n^{k-1}) algorithm for this problem (where the O^*(⋅) notation omits subpolynomial factors). We show that the problem can be solved in time O^*(n^{k - 2 + 4/(k+2)}) for even k and in time O^*(n^{k - 2 + (4k-8)/(k²-5)}) for odd k in the real RAM model of computation. We also prove that for k = 4, the problem can be solved in time O^*(n^2.625) in the algebraic decision tree model, and for k = 5 it can be solved in time O^*(n^3.56) in the same model, both improving on the above uniform bounds. All our results rely on an algebraic generalization of the standard meet-in-the-middle algorithm for k-SUM, powered by recent algorithmic advances in the polynomial method for semi-algebraic range searching. In fact, our main technical result is much more broadly applicable, as it provides a general tool for detecting incidences and other interactions between points and algebraic surfaces in any dimension. In particular, it yields an efficient algorithm for a general, algebraic version of Hopcroft’s point-line incidence detection problem in any dimension.

 Constant-Hop Spanners for More Geometric Intersection Graphs, with Even Smaller Size   
 Authors:  Timothy M. Chan and Zhengcheng Huang  
  Abstract    
 In SoCG 2022, Conroy and Tóth presented several constructions of sparse, low-hop spanners in geometric intersection graphs, including an O(nlog n)-size 3-hop spanner for n disks (or fat convex objects) in the plane, and an O(nlog² n)-size 3-hop spanner for n axis-aligned rectangles in the plane. Their work left open two major questions: (i) can the size be made closer to linear by allowing larger constant stretch? and (ii) can near-linear size be achieved for more general classes of intersection graphs? We address both questions simultaneously, by presenting new constructions of constant-hop spanners that have almost linear size and that hold for a much larger class of intersection graphs. More precisely, we prove the existence of an O(1)-hop spanner for arbitrary string graphs with O(nα_k(n)) size for any constant k, where α_k(n) denotes the k-th function in the inverse Ackermann hierarchy. We similarly prove the existence of an O(1)-hop spanner for intersection graphs of d-dimensional fat objects with O(nα_k(n)) size for any constant k and d. We also improve on some of Conroy and Tóth’s specific previous results, in either the number of hops or the size: we describe an O(nlog n)-size 2-hop spanner for disks (or more generally objects with linear union complexity) in the plane, and an O(nlog n)-size 3-hop spanner for axis-aligned rectangles in the plane. Our proofs are all simple, using separator theorems, recursion, shifted quadtrees, and shallow cuttings.

 Minimum L_∞ Hausdorff Distance of Point Sets Under Translation: Generalizing Klee’s Measure Problem   
 Authors:  Timothy M. Chan  
  Abstract    
 We present a (combinatorial) algorithm with running time close to O(n^d) for computing the minimum directed L_∞ Hausdorff distance between two sets of n points under translations in any constant dimension d. This substantially improves the best previous time bound near O(n^{5d/4}) by Chew, Dor, Efrat, and Kedem from more than twenty years ago. Our solution is obtained by a new generalization of Chan’s algorithm [FOCS'13] for Klee’s measure problem. To complement this algorithmic result, we also prove a nearly matching conditional lower bound close to Ω(n^d) for combinatorial algorithms, under the Combinatorial k-Clique Hypothesis.

 Meta-Diagrams for 2-Parameter Persistence   
 Authors:  Nate Clause, Tamal K. Dey, Facundo Mémoli, and Bei Wang  
  Abstract    
 We first introduce the notion of meta-rank for a 2-parameter persistence module, an invariant that captures the information behind images of morphisms between 1D slices of the module. We then define the meta-diagram of a 2-parameter persistence module to be the Möbius inversion of the meta-rank, resulting in a function that takes values from signed 1-parameter persistence modules. We show that the meta-rank and meta-diagram contain information equivalent to the rank invariant and the signed barcode. This equivalence leads to computational benefits, as we introduce an algorithm for computing the meta-rank and meta-diagram of a 2-parameter module M indexed by a bifiltration of n simplices in O(n³) time. This implies an improvement upon the existing algorithm for computing the signed barcode, which has O(n⁴) time complexity. This also allows us to improve the existing upper bound on the number of rectangles in the rank decomposition of M from O(n⁴) to O(n³). In addition, we define notions of erosion distance between meta-ranks and between meta-diagrams, and show that under these distances, meta-ranks and meta-diagrams are stable with respect to the interleaving distance. Lastly, the meta-diagram can be visualized in an intuitive fashion as a persistence diagram of diagrams, which generalizes the well-understood persistence diagram in the 1-parameter setting.

 Algorithms for Length Spectra of Combinatorial Tori   
 Authors:  Vincent Delecroix, Matthijs Ebbens, Francis Lazarus, and Ivan Yakovlev  
  Abstract    
 Consider a weighted, undirected graph cellularly embedded on a topological surface. The function assigning to each free homotopy class of closed curves the length of a shortest cycle within this homotopy class is called the marked length spectrum. The (unmarked) length spectrum is obtained by just listing the length values of the marked length spectrum in increasing order. In this paper, we describe algorithms for computing the (un)marked length spectra of graphs embedded on the torus. More specifically, we preprocess a weighted graph of complexity n in time O(n² log log n) so that, given a cycle with 𝓁 edges representing a free homotopy class, the length of a shortest homotopic cycle can be computed in O(𝓁+log n) time. Moreover, given any positive integer k, the first k values of its unmarked length spectrum can be computed in time O(k log n). Our algorithms are based on a correspondence between weighted graphs on the torus and polyhedral norms. In particular, we give a weight independent bound on the complexity of the unit ball of such norms. As an immediate consequence we can decide if two embedded weighted graphs have the same marked spectrum in polynomial time. We also consider the problem of comparing the unmarked spectra and provide a polynomial time algorithm in the unweighted case and a randomized polynomial time algorithm otherwise.

 Computing a Dirichlet Domain for a Hyperbolic Surface   
 Authors:  Vincent Despré, Benedikt Kolbe, Hugo Parlier, and Monique Teillaud  
  Abstract    
 This paper exhibits and analyzes an algorithm that takes a given closed orientable hyperbolic surface and outputs an explicit Dirichlet domain. The input is a fundamental polygon with side pairings. While grounded in topological considerations, the algorithm makes key use of the geometry of the surface. We introduce data structures that reflect this interplay between geometry and topology and show that the algorithm runs in polynomial time, in terms of the initial perimeter and the genus of the surface.

 The Parameterized Complexity of Coordinated Motion Planning   
 Authors:  Eduard Eiben, Robert Ganian, and Iyad Kanj  
  Abstract    
 In Coordinated Motion Planning (CMP), we are given a rectangular-grid on which k robots occupy k distinct starting gridpoints and need to reach k distinct destination gridpoints. In each time step, any robot may move to a neighboring gridpoint or stay in its current gridpoint, provided that it does not collide with other robots. The goal is to compute a schedule for moving the k robots to their destinations which minimizes a certain objective target - prominently the number of time steps in the schedule, i.e., the makespan, or the total length traveled by the robots. We refer to the problem arising from minimizing the former objective target as CMP-M and the latter as CMP-L. Both CMP-M and CMP-L are fundamental problems that were posed as the computational geometry challenge of SoCG 2021, and CMP also embodies the famous (n²-1)-puzzle as a special case. In this paper, we settle the parameterized complexity of CMP-M and CMP-L with respect to their two most fundamental parameters: the number of robots, and the objective target. We develop a new approach to establish the fixed-parameter tractability of both problems under the former parameterization that relies on novel structural insights into optimal solutions to the problem. When parameterized by the objective target, we show that CMP-L remains fixed-parameter tractable while CMP-M becomes para-NP-hard. The latter result is noteworthy, not only because it improves the previously-known boundaries of intractability for the problem, but also because the underlying reduction allows us to establish - as a simpler case - the NP-hardness of the classical Vertex Disjoint and Edge Disjoint Paths problems with constant path-lengths on grids.

 Non-Crossing Hamiltonian Paths and Cycles in Output-Polynomial Time   
 Authors:  David Eppstein  
  Abstract    
 We show that, for planar point sets, the number of non-crossing Hamiltonian paths is polynomially bounded in the number of non-crossing paths, and the number of non-crossing Hamiltonian cycles (polygonalizations) is polynomially bounded in the number of surrounding cycles. As a consequence, we can list the non-crossing Hamiltonian paths or the polygonalizations, in time polynomial in the output size, by filtering the output of simple backtracking algorithms for non-crossing paths or surrounding cycles respectively. To prove these results we relate the numbers of non-crossing structures to two easily-computed parameters of the point set: the minimum number of points whose removal results in a collinear set, and the number of points interior to the convex hull. These relations also lead to polynomial-time approximation algorithms for the numbers of structures of all four types, accurate to within a constant factor of the logarithm of these numbers.

 Finding a Maximum Clique in a Disk Graph   
 Authors:  Jared Espenant, J. Mark Keil, and Debajyoti Mondal  
  Abstract    
 A disk graph is an intersection graph of disks in the Euclidean plane, where the disks correspond to the vertices of the graph and a pair of vertices are adjacent if and only if their corresponding disks intersect. The problem of determining the time complexity of computing a maximum clique in a disk graph is a long-standing open question that has been very well studied in the literature. The problem is known to be open even when the radii of all the disks are in the interval [1,(1+ε)], where ε > 0. If all the disks are unit disks then there exists an O(n³log n)-time algorithm to compute a maximum clique, which is the best-known running time for over a decade. Although the problem of computing a maximum clique in a disk graph remains open, it is known to be APX-hard for the intersection graphs of many other convex objects such as intersection graphs of ellipses, triangles, and a combination of unit disks and axis-parallel rectangles. Here we obtain the following results. - We give an algorithm to compute a maximum clique in a unit disk graph in O(n^2.5 log n)-time, which improves the previously best known running time of O(n³log n) [Eppstein '09]. - We extend a widely used "co-2-subdivision approach" to prove that computing a maximum clique in a combination of unit disks and axis-parallel rectangles is NP-hard to approximate within 4448/4449 ≈ 0.9997. The use of a "co-2-subdivision approach" was previously thought to be unlikely in this setting [Bonnet et al. '20]. Our result improves the previously known inapproximability factor of 7633010347/7633010348 ≈ 0.9999. - We show that the parameter minimum lens width of the disk arrangement may be used to make progress in the case when disk radii are in [1,(1+ε)]. For example, if the minimum lens width is at least 0.265 and ε ≤ 0.0001, which still allows for non-Helly triples in the arrangement, then one can find a maximum clique in polynomial time.

 Linear Size Universal Point Sets for Classes of Planar Graphs   
 Authors:  Stefan Felsner, Hendrik Schrezenmaier, Felix Schröder, and Raphael Steiner  
  Abstract    
 A finite set P of points in the plane is n-universal with respect to a class 𝒞 of planar graphs if every n-vertex graph in 𝒞 admits a crossing-free straight-line drawing with vertices at points of P. For the class of all planar graphs the best known upper bound on the size of a universal point set is quadratic and the best known lower bound is linear in n. Some classes of planar graphs are known to admit universal point sets of near linear size, however, there are no truly linear bounds for interesting classes beyond outerplanar graphs. In this paper, we show that there is a universal point set of size 2n-2 for the class of bipartite planar graphs with n vertices. The same point set is also universal for the class of n-vertex planar graphs of maximum degree 3. The point set used for the results is what we call an exploding double chain, and we prove that this point set allows planar straight-line embeddings of many more planar graphs, namely of all subgraphs of planar graphs admitting a one-sided Hamiltonian cycle. The result for bipartite graphs also implies that every n-vertex plane graph has a 1-bend drawing all whose bends and vertices are contained in a specific point set of size 4n-6, this improves a bound of 6n-10 for the same problem by Löffler and Tóth.

 When Ternary Triangulated Disc Packings Are Densest: Examples, Counter-Examples and Techniques   
 Authors:  Thomas Fernique and Daria Pchelina  
  Abstract    
 We consider ternary disc packings of the plane, i.e. the packings using discs of three different radii. Packings in which each "hole" is bounded by three pairwise tangent discs are called triangulated. Connelly conjectured that when such packings exist, one of them maximizes the proportion of the covered surface: this holds for unary and binary disc packings. For ternary packings, there are 164 pairs (r, s), 1 > r > s, allowing triangulated packings by discs of radii 1, r and s. In this paper, we enhance existing methods of dealing with maximal-density packings in order to study ternary triangulated packings. We prove that the conjecture holds for 31 triplets of disc radii and disprove it for 40 other triplets. Finally, we classify the remaining cases where our methods are not applicable. Our approach is based on the ideas present in the Hales' proof of the Kepler conjecture. Notably, our proof features local density redistribution based on computer search and interval arithmetic.

 Labeled Nearest Neighbor Search and Metric Spanners via Locality Sensitive Orderings   
 Authors:  Arnold Filtser  
  Abstract    
 Chan, Har-Peled, and Jones [SICOMP 2020] developed locality-sensitive orderings (LSO) for Euclidean space. A (τ,ρ)-LSO is a collection Σ of orderings such that for every x,y ∈ ℝ^d there is an ordering σ ∈ Σ, where all the points between x and y w.r.t. σ are in the ρ-neighborhood of either x or y. In essence, LSO allow one to reduce problems to the 1-dimensional line. Later, Filtser and Le [STOC 2022] developed LSO’s for doubling metrics, general metric spaces, and minor free graphs. For Euclidean and doubling spaces, the number of orderings in the LSO is exponential in the dimension, which made them mainly useful for the low dimensional regime. In this paper, we develop new LSO’s for Euclidean, 𝓁_p, and doubling spaces that allow us to trade larger stretch for a much smaller number of orderings. We then use our new LSO’s (as well as the previous ones) to construct path reporting low hop spanners, fault tolerant spanners, reliable spanners, and light spanners for different metric spaces. While many nearest neighbor search (NNS) data structures were constructed for metric spaces with implicit distance representations (where the distance between two metric points can be computed using their names, e.g. Euclidean space), for other spaces almost nothing is known. In this paper we initiate the study of the labeled NNS problem, where one is allowed to artificially assign labels (short names) to metric points. We use LSO’s to construct efficient labeled NNS data structures in this model.

 Polynomial-Time Approximation Schemes for Independent Packing Problems on Fractionally Tree-Independence-Number-Fragile Graphs   
 Authors:  Esther Galby, Andrea Munaro, and Shizhou Yang  
  Abstract    
 We investigate a relaxation of the notion of treewidth-fragility, namely tree-independence-number-fragility. In particular, we obtain polynomial-time approximation schemes for independent packing problems on fractionally tree-independence-number-fragile graph classes. Our approach unifies and extends several known polynomial-time approximation schemes on seemingly unrelated graph classes, such as classes of intersection graphs of fat objects in a fixed dimension or proper minor-closed classes. We also study the related notion of layered tree-independence number, a relaxation of layered treewidth.

 Voronoi Diagrams in the Hilbert Metric   
 Authors:  Auguste H. Gezalyan and David M. Mount  
  Abstract    
 The Hilbert metric is a distance function defined for points lying within a convex body. It generalizes the Cayley-Klein model of hyperbolic geometry to any convex set, and it has numerous applications in the analysis and processing of convex bodies. In this paper, we study the geometric and combinatorial properties of the Voronoi diagram of a set of point sites under the Hilbert metric. Given any m-sided convex polygon Ω in the plane, we present two randomized incremental algorithms and one deterministic algorithm. The first randomized algorithm and the deterministic algorithm compute the Voronoi diagram of a set of n point sites. The second randomized algorithm extends this to compute the Voronoi diagram of the set of n sites, each of which may be a point or a line segment. Our algorithms all run in expected time O(m n log n). The algorithms use O(m n) storage, which matches the worst-case combinatorial complexity of the Voronoi diagram in the Hilbert metric.

 Combinatorial Designs Meet Hypercliques: Higher Lower Bounds for Klee’s Measure Problem and Related Problems in Dimensions d ≥ 4   
 Authors:  Egor Gorbachev and Marvin Künnemann  
  Abstract    
 Klee’s measure problem (computing the volume of the union of n axis-parallel boxes in ℝ^d) is well known to have n^{d/2± o(1)}-time algorithms (Overmars, Yap, SICOMP'91; Chan FOCS'13). Only recently, a conditional lower bound (without any restriction to "combinatorial" algorithms) could be shown for d = 3 (Künnemann, FOCS'22). Can this result be extended to a tight lower bound for dimensions d ≥ 4? In this paper, we formalize the technique of the tight lower bound for d = 3 using a combinatorial object we call prefix covering design. We show that these designs, which are related in spirit to combinatorial designs, directly translate to conditional lower bounds for Klee’s measure problem and various related problems. By devising good prefix covering designs, we give the following lower bounds for Klee’s measure problem in ℝ^d, the depth problem for axis-parallel boxes in ℝ^d, the largest-volume/max-perimeter empty (anchored) box problem in ℝ^{2d}, and related problems: - Ω(n^1.90476) for d = 4, - Ω(n^2.22222) for d = 5, - Ω(n^{d/3 + 2√d/9-o(√d)}) for general d, assuming the 3-uniform hyperclique hypothesis. For Klee’s measure problem and the depth problem, these bounds improve previous lower bounds of Ω(n^{1.777...}), Ω(n^{2.0833...}) and Ω(n^{d/3 + 1/3 + Θ(1/d)}) respectively. Our improved prefix covering designs were obtained by (1) exploiting a computer-aided search using problem-specific insights as well as SAT solvers, and (2) showing how to transform combinatorial covering designs known in the literature to strong prefix covering designs. In contrast, we show that our lower bounds are close to best possible using this proof technique.

 A Generalization of the Persistent Laplacian to Simplicial Maps   
 Authors:  Aziz Burak Gülen, Facundo Mémoli, Zhengchao Wan, and Yusu Wang  
  Abstract    
 The (combinatorial) graph Laplacian is a fundamental object in the analysis of, and optimization on, graphs. Via a topological view, this operator can be extended to a simplicial complex K and therefore offers a way to perform "signal processing" on p-(co)chains of K. Recently, the concept of persistent Laplacian was proposed and studied for a pair of simplicial complexes K ↪ L connected by an inclusion relation, further broadening the use of Laplace-based operators. In this paper, we significantly expand the scope of the persistent Laplacian by generalizing it to a pair of weighted simplicial complexes connected by a weight preserving simplicial map f: K → L. Such a simplicial map setting arises frequently, e.g., when relating a coarsened simplicial representation with an original representation, or the case when the two simplicial complexes are spanned by different point sets, i.e. cases in which it does not hold that K ⊂ L. However, the simplicial map setting is much more challenging than the inclusion setting since the underlying algebraic structure is much more complicated. We present a natural generalization of the persistent Laplacian to the simplicial setting. To shed insight on the structure behind it, as well as to develop an algorithm to compute it, we exploit the relationship between the persistent Laplacian and the Schur complement of a matrix. A critical step is to view the Schur complement as a functorial way of restricting a self-adjoint positive semi-definite operator to a given subspace. As a consequence of this relation, we prove that the qth persistent Betti number of the simplicial map f: K → L equals the nullity of the qth persistent Laplacian Δ_q^{K,L}. We then propose an algorithm for finding the matrix representation of Δ_q^{K,L} which in turn yields a fundamentally different algorithm for computing the qth persistent Betti number of a simplicial map. Finally, we study the persistent Laplacian on simplicial towers under weight-preserving simplicial maps and establish monotonicity results for their eigenvalues.

 The Christoffel-Darboux Kernel for Topological Data Analysis   
 Authors:  Pepijn Roos Hoefgeest and Lucas Slot  
  Abstract    
 Persistent homology has been widely used to study the topology of point clouds in ℝⁿ. Standard approaches are very sensitive to outliers, and their computational complexity depends badly on the number of data points. In this paper we introduce a novel persistence module for a point cloud using the theory of Christoffel-Darboux kernels. This module is robust to (statistical) outliers in the data, and can be computed in time linear in the number of data points. We illustrate the benefits and limitations of our new module with various numerical examples in ℝⁿ, for n = 1, 2, 3. Our work expands upon recent applications of Christoffel-Darboux kernels in the context of statistical data analysis and geometric inference [Lasserre et al., 2022]. There, these kernels are used to construct a polynomial whose level sets capture the geometry of a point cloud in a precise sense. We show that the persistent homology associated to the sublevel set filtration of this polynomial is stable with respect to the Wasserstein distance. Moreover, we show that the persistent homology of this filtration can be computed in singly exponential time in the ambient dimension n, using a recent algorithm of Basu & Karisani [Basu and Karisani, 2022].

 The Number of Edges in Maximal 2-Planar Graphs   
 Authors:  Michael Hoffmann and Meghana M. Reddy  
  Abstract    
 A graph is 2-planar if it has local crossing number two, that is, it can be drawn in the plane such that every edge has at most two crossings. A graph is maximal 2-planar if no edge can be added such that the resulting graph remains 2-planar. A 2-planar graph on n vertices has at most 5n-10 edges, and some (maximal) 2-planar graphs - referred to as optimal 2-planar - achieve this bound. However, in strong contrast to maximal planar graphs, a maximal 2-planar graph may have fewer than the maximum possible number of edges. In this paper, we determine the minimum edge density of maximal 2-planar graphs by proving that every maximal 2-planar graph on n ≥ 5 vertices has at least 2n edges. We also show that this bound is tight, up to an additive constant. The lower bound is based on an analysis of the degree distribution in specific classes of drawings of the graph. The upper bound construction is verified by carefully exploring the space of admissible drawings using computer support.

 Worst-Case Deterministic Fully-Dynamic Biconnectivity in Changeable Planar Embeddings   
 Authors:  Jacob Holm, Ivor van der Hoog, and Eva Rotenberg  
  Abstract    
 We study dynamic planar graphs with n vertices, subject to edge deletion, edge contraction, edge insertion across a face, and the splitting of a vertex in specified corners. We dynamically maintain a combinatorial embedding of such a planar graph, subject to connectivity and 2-vertex-connectivity (biconnectivity) queries between pairs of vertices. Whenever a query pair is connected and not biconnected, we find the first and last cutvertex separating them. Additionally, we allow local changes to the embedding by flipping the embedding of a subgraph that is connected by at most two vertices to the rest of the graph. We support all queries and updates in deterministic, worst-case, O(log² n) time, using an O(n)-sized data structure.

 Disjoint Faces in Drawings of the Complete Graph and Topological Heilbronn Problems   
 Authors:  Alfredo Hubard and Andrew Suk  
  Abstract    
 Given a complete simple topological graph G, a k-face generated by G is the open bounded region enclosed by the edges of a non-self-intersecting k-cycle in G. Interestingly, there are complete simple topological graphs with the property that every odd face it generates contains the origin. In this paper, we show that every complete n-vertex simple topological graph generates at least Ω(n^{1/3}) pairwise disjoint 4-faces. As an immediate corollary, every complete simple topological graph on n vertices drawn in the unit square generates a 4-face with area at most O(n^{-1/3}). Finally, we investigate a ℤ₂ variant of Heilbronn’s triangle problem for not necessarily simple complete topological graphs.

 On the Width of Complicated JSJ Decompositions   
 Authors:  Kristóf Huszár and Jonathan Spreer  
  Abstract    
 Motivated by the algorithmic study of 3-dimensional manifolds, we explore the structural relationship between the JSJ decomposition of a given 3-manifold and its triangulations. Building on work of Bachman, Derby-Talbot and Sedgwick, we show that a "sufficiently complicated" JSJ decomposition of a 3-manifold enforces a "complicated structure" for all of its triangulations. More concretely, we show that, under certain conditions, the treewidth (resp. pathwidth) of the graph that captures the incidences between the pieces of the JSJ decomposition of an irreducible, closed, orientable 3-manifold M yields a linear lower bound on its treewidth tw (M) (resp. pathwidth pw(M)), defined as the smallest treewidth (resp. pathwidth) of the dual graph of any triangulation of M. We present several applications of this result. We give the first example of an infinite family of bounded-treewidth 3-manifolds with unbounded pathwidth. We construct Haken 3-manifolds with arbitrarily large treewidth - previously the existence of such 3-manifolds was only known in the non-Haken case. We also show that the problem of providing a constant-factor approximation for the treewidth (resp. pathwidth) of bounded-degree graphs efficiently reduces to computing a constant-factor approximation for the treewidth (resp. pathwidth) of 3-manifolds.

 Reconfiguration of Colorings in Triangulations of the Sphere   
 Authors:  Takehiro Ito, Yuni Iwamasa, Yusuke Kobayashi, Shun-ichi Maezawa, Yuta Nozaki, Yoshio Okamoto, and Kenta Ozeki  
  Abstract    
 In 1973, Fisk proved that any 4-coloring of a 3-colorable triangulation of the 2-sphere can be obtained from any 3-coloring by a sequence of Kempe-changes. On the other hand, in the case where we are only allowed to recolor a single vertex in each step, which is a special case of a Kempe-change, there exists a 4-coloring that cannot be obtained from any 3-coloring. In this paper, we present a linear-time checkable characterization of a 4-coloring of a 3-colorable triangulation of the 2-sphere that can be obtained from a 3-coloring by a sequence of recoloring operations at single vertices. In addition, we develop a quadratic-time algorithm to find such a recoloring sequence if it exists; our proof implies that we can always obtain a quadratic length recoloring sequence. We also present a linear-time checkable criterion for a 3-colorable triangulation of the 2-sphere that all 4-colorings can be obtained from a 3-coloring by such a sequence. Moreover, we consider a high-dimensional setting. As a natural generalization of our first result, we obtain a polynomial-time checkable characterization of a k-coloring of a (k-1)-colorable triangulation of the (k-2)-sphere that can be obtained from a (k-1)-coloring by a sequence of recoloring operations at single vertices and the corresponding algorithmic result. Furthermore, we show that the problem of deciding whether, for given two (k+1)-colorings of a (k-1)-colorable triangulation of the (k-2)-sphere, one can be obtained from the other by such a sequence is PSPACE-complete for any fixed k ≥ 4. Our results above can be rephrased as new results on the computational problems named k-Recoloring and Connectedness of k-Coloring Reconfiguration Graph, which are fundamental problems in the field of combinatorial reconfiguration.

 On the Geometric Thickness of 2-Degenerate Graphs   
 Authors:  Rahul Jain, Marco Ricci, Jonathan Rollin, and André Schulz  
  Abstract    
 A graph is 2-degenerate if every subgraph contains a vertex of degree at most 2. We show that every 2-degenerate graph can be drawn with straight lines such that the drawing decomposes into 4 plane forests. Therefore, the geometric arboricity, and hence the geometric thickness, of 2-degenerate graphs is at most 4. On the other hand, we show that there are 2-degenerate graphs that do not admit any straight-line drawing with a decomposition of the edge set into 2 plane graphs. That is, there are 2-degenerate graphs with geometric thickness, and hence geometric arboricity, at least 3. This answers two questions posed by Eppstein [Separating thickness from geometric thickness. In Towards a Theory of Geometric Graphs, vol. 342 of Contemp. Math., AMS, 2004].

 The Localized Union-Of-Balls Bifiltration   
 Authors:  Michael Kerber and Matthias Söls  
  Abstract    
 We propose an extension of the classical union-of-balls filtration of persistent homology: fixing a point q, we focus our attention to a ball centered at q whose radius is controlled by a second scale parameter. We discuss an absolute variant, where the union is just restricted to the q-ball, and a relative variant where the homology of the q-ball relative to its boundary is considered. Interestingly, these natural constructions lead to bifiltered simplicial complexes which are not k-critical for any finite k. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that these bifiltrations can be computed exactly and efficiently, and we provide a prototypical implementation using the CGAL library. We also argue that some of the recent algorithmic advances for 2-parameter persistence (which usually assume k-criticality for some finite k) carry over to the ∞-critical case.

 Online and Dynamic Algorithms for Geometric Set Cover and Hitting Set   
 Authors:  Arindam Khan, Aditya Lonkar, Saladi Rahul, Aditya Subramanian, and Andreas Wiese  
  Abstract    
 Set cover and hitting set are fundamental problems in combinatorial optimization which are well-studied in the offline, online, and dynamic settings. We study the geometric versions of these problems and present new online and dynamic algorithms for them. In the online version of set cover (resp. hitting set), m sets (resp. n points) are given and n points (resp. m sets) arrive online, one-by-one. In the dynamic versions, points (resp. sets) can arrive as well as depart. Our goal is to maintain a set cover (resp. hitting set), minimizing the size of the computed solution. For online set cover for (axis-parallel) squares of arbitrary sizes, we present a tight O(log n)-competitive algorithm. In the same setting for hitting set, we provide a tight O(log N)-competitive algorithm, assuming that all points have integral coordinates in [0,N)². No online algorithm had been known for either of these settings, not even for unit squares (apart from the known online algorithms for arbitrary set systems). For both dynamic set cover and hitting set with d-dimensional hyperrectangles, we obtain (log m)^O(d)-approximation algorithms with (log m)^O(d) worst-case update time. This partially answers an open question posed by Chan et al. [SODA'22]. Previously, no dynamic algorithms with polylogarithmic update time were known even in the setting of squares (for either of these problems). Our main technical contributions are an extended quad-tree approach and a frequency reduction technique that reduces geometric set cover instances to instances of general set cover with bounded frequency.

 Sparse Euclidean Spanners with Optimal Diameter: A General and Robust Lower Bound via a Concave Inverse-Ackermann Function   
 Authors:  Hung Le, Lazar Milenković, and Shay Solomon  
  Abstract    
 In STOC'95 [S. Arya et al., 1995] Arya et al. showed that any set of n points in ℝ^d admits a (1+ε)-spanner with hop-diameter at most 2 (respectively, 3) and O(n log n) edges (resp., O(n log log n) edges). They also gave a general upper bound tradeoff of hop-diameter k with O(n α_k(n)) edges, for any k ≥ 2. The function α_k is the inverse of a certain Ackermann-style function, where α₀(n) = ⌈n/2⌉, α₁(n) = ⌈√n⌉, α₂(n) = ⌈log n⌉, α₃(n) = ⌈log log n⌉, α₄(n) = log^* n, α₅(n) = ⌊ 1/2 log^*n ⌋, …. Roughly speaking, for k ≥ 2 the function α_{k} is close to ⌊(k-2)/2⌋-iterated log-star function, i.e., log with ⌊(k-2)/2⌋ stars. Despite a large body of work on spanners of bounded hop-diameter, the fundamental question of whether this tradeoff between size and hop-diameter of Euclidean (1+ε)-spanners is optimal has remained open, even in one-dimensional spaces. Three lower bound tradeoffs are known: - An optimal k versus Ω(n α_k(n)) by Alon and Schieber [N. Alon and B. Schieber, 1987], but it applies to stretch 1 (not 1+ε). - A suboptimal k versus Ω(nα_{2k+6}(n)) by Chan and Gupta [H. T.-H. Chan and A. Gupta, 2006]. - A suboptimal k versus Ω(n/(2^{6⌊k/2⌋}) α_k(n)) by Le et al. [Le et al., 2022]. This paper establishes the optimal k versus Ω(n α_k(n)) lower bound tradeoff for stretch 1+ε, for any ε > 0, and for any k. An important conceptual contribution of this work is in achieving optimality by shaving off an extremely slowly growing term, namely 2^{6⌊k/2⌋} for k ≤ O(α(n)); such a fine-grained optimization (that achieves optimality) is very rare in the literature. To shave off the 2^{6⌊k/2⌋} term from the previous bound of Le et al., our argument has to drill much deeper. In particular, we propose a new way of analyzing recurrences that involve inverse-Ackermann style functions, and our key technical contribution is in presenting the first explicit construction of concave versions of these functions. An important advantage of our approach over previous ones is its robustness: While all previous lower bounds are applicable only to restricted 1-dimensional point sets, ours applies even to random point sets in constant-dimensional spaces.

 Shortest Paths in Portalgons   
 Authors:  Maarten Löffler, Tim Ophelders, Rodrigo I. Silveira, and Frank Staals  
  Abstract    
 Any surface that is intrinsically polyhedral can be represented by a collection of simple polygons (fragments), glued along pairs of equally long oriented edges, where each fragment is endowed with the geodesic metric arising from its Euclidean metric. We refer to such a representation as a portalgon, and we call two portalgons equivalent if the surfaces they represent are isometric. We analyze the complexity of shortest paths. We call a fragment happy if any shortest path on the portalgon visits it at most a constant number of times. A portalgon is happy if all of its fragments are happy. We present an efficient algorithm to compute shortest paths on happy portalgons. The number of times that a shortest path visits a fragment is unbounded in general. We contrast this by showing that the intrinsic Delaunay triangulation of any polyhedral surface corresponds to a happy portalgon. Since computing the intrinsic Delaunay triangulation may be inefficient, we provide an efficient algorithm to compute happy portalgons for a restricted class of portalgons.

 The Geodesic Edge Center of a Simple Polygon   
 Authors:  Anna Lubiw and Anurag Murty Naredla  
  Abstract    
 The geodesic edge center of a polygon is a point c inside the polygon that minimizes the maximum geodesic distance from c to any edge of the polygon, where geodesic distance is the shortest path distance inside the polygon. We give a linear-time algorithm to find a geodesic edge center of a simple polygon. This improves on the previous O(n log n) time algorithm by Lubiw and Naredla [European Symposium on Algorithms, 2021]. The algorithm builds on an algorithm to find the geodesic vertex center of a simple polygon due to Pollack, Sharir, and Rote [Discrete & Computational Geometry, 1989] and an improvement to linear time by Ahn, Barba, Bose, De Carufel, Korman, and Oh [Discrete & Computational Geometry, 2016]. The geodesic edge center can easily be found from the geodesic farthest-edge Voronoi diagram of the polygon. Finding that Voronoi diagram in linear time is an open question, although the geodesic nearest edge Voronoi diagram (the medial axis) can be found in linear time. As a first step of our geodesic edge center algorithm, we give a linear-time algorithm to find the geodesic farthest-edge Voronoi diagram restricted to the polygon boundary.

 A Structural Approach to Tree Decompositions of Knots and Spatial Graphs   
 Authors:  Corentin Lunel and Arnaud de Mesmay  
  Abstract    
 Knots are commonly represented and manipulated via diagrams, which are decorated planar graphs. When such a knot diagram has low treewidth, parameterized graph algorithms can be leveraged to ensure the fast computation of many invariants and properties of the knot. It was recently proved that there exist knots which do not admit any diagram of low treewidth, and the proof relied on intricate low-dimensional topology techniques. In this work, we initiate a thorough investigation of tree decompositions of knot diagrams (or more generally, diagrams of spatial graphs) using ideas from structural graph theory. We define an obstruction on spatial embeddings that forbids low tree width diagrams, and we prove that it is optimal with respect to a related width invariant. We then show the existence of this obstruction for knots of high representativity, which include for example torus knots, providing a new and self-contained proof that those do not admit diagrams of low treewidth. This last step is inspired by a result of Pardon on knot distortion.

 Ephemeral Persistence Features and the Stability of Filtered Chain Complexes   
 Authors:  Facundo Mémoli and Ling Zhou  
  Abstract    
 We strengthen the usual stability theorem for Vietoris-Rips (VR) persistent homology of finite metric spaces by building upon constructions due to Usher and Zhang in the context of filtered chain complexes. The information present at the level of filtered chain complexes includes ephemeral points, i.e. points with zero persistence, which provide additional information to that present at homology level. The resulting invariant, called verbose barcode, which has a stronger discriminating power than the usual barcode, is proved to be stable under certain metrics which are sensitive to these ephemeral points. In some situations, we provide ways to compute such metrics between verbose barcodes. We also exhibit several examples of finite metric spaces with identical (standard) VR barcodes yet with different verbose VR barcodes thus confirming that these ephemeral points strengthen the discriminating power of the standard VR barcode.

 Abstract Voronoi-Like Graphs: Extending Delaunay’s Theorem and Applications   
 Authors:  Evanthia Papadopoulou  
  Abstract    
 Any system of bisectors (in the sense of abstract Voronoi diagrams) defines an arrangement of simple curves in the plane. We define Voronoi-like graphs on such an arrangement, which are graphs whose vertices are locally Voronoi. A vertex v is called locally Voronoi, if v and its incident edges appear in the Voronoi diagram of three sites. In a so-called admissible bisector system, where Voronoi regions are connected and cover the plane, we prove that any Voronoi-like graph is indeed an abstract Voronoi diagram. The result can be seen as an abstract dual version of Delaunay’s theorem on (locally) empty circles. Further, we define Voronoi-like cycles in an admissible bisector system, and show that the Voronoi-like graph induced by such a cycle C is a unique tree (or a forest, if C is unbounded). In the special case where C is the boundary of an abstract Voronoi region, the induced Voronoi-like graph can be computed in expected linear time following the technique of [Junginger and Papadopoulou SOCG'18]. Otherwise, within the same time, the algorithm constructs the Voronoi-like graph of a cycle C′ on the same set (or subset) of sites, which may equal C or be enclosed by C. Overall, the technique computes abstract Voronoi (or Voronoi-like) trees and forests in linear expected time, given the order of their leaves along a Voronoi-like cycle. We show a direct application in updating a constraint Delaunay triangulation in linear expected time, after the insertion of a new segment constraint, simplifying upon the result of [Shewchuk and Brown CGTA 2015].

 Random Projections for Curves in High Dimensions   
 Authors:  Ioannis Psarros and Dennis Rohde  
  Abstract    
 Modern time series analysis requires the ability to handle datasets that are inherently high-dimensional; examples include applications in climatology, where measurements from numerous sensors must be taken into account, or inventory tracking of large shops, where the dimension is defined by the number of tracked items. The standard way to mitigate computational issues arising from the high dimensionality of the data is by applying some dimension reduction technique that preserves the structural properties of the ambient space. The dissimilarity between two time series is often measured by "discrete" notions of distance, e.g. the dynamic time warping or the discrete Fréchet distance. Since all these distance functions are computed directly on the points of a time series, they are sensitive to different sampling rates or gaps. The continuous Fréchet distance offers a popular alternative which aims to alleviate this by taking into account all points on the polygonal curve obtained by linearly interpolating between any two consecutive points in a sequence. We study the ability of random projections à la Johnson and Lindenstrauss to preserve the continuous Fréchet distance of polygonal curves by effectively reducing the dimension. In particular, we show that one can reduce the dimension to O(ε^{-2} log N), where N is the total number of input points while preserving the continuous Fréchet distance between any two determined polygonal curves within a factor of 1± ε. We conclude with applications on clustering.

 New Approximation Algorithms for Touring Regions   
 Authors:  Benjamin Qi and Richard Qi  
  Abstract    
 We analyze the touring regions problem: find a (1+ε)-approximate Euclidean shortest path in d-dimensional space that starts at a given starting point, ends at a given ending point, and visits given regions R₁, R₂, R₃, … , R_n in that order. Our main result is an O (n/√ε log{1/ε} + 1/ε)-time algorithm for touring disjoint disks. We also give an O(min(n/ε, n²/√ε))-time algorithm for touring disjoint two-dimensional convex fat bodies. Both of these results naturally generalize to larger dimensions; we obtain O(n/{ε^{d-1}} log²1/ε + 1/ε^{2d-2}) and O(n/ε^{2d-2})-time algorithms for touring disjoint d-dimensional balls and convex fat bodies, respectively.

 Combinatorial Depth Measures for Hyperplane Arrangements   
 Authors:  Patrick Schnider and Pablo Soberón  
  Abstract    
 Regression depth, introduced by Rousseeuw and Hubert in 1999, is a notion that measures how good of a regression hyperplane a given query hyperplane is with respect to a set of data points. Under projective duality, this can be interpreted as a depth measure for query points with respect to an arrangement of data hyperplanes. The study of depth measures for query points with respect to a set of data points has a long history, and many such depth measures have natural counterparts in the setting of hyperplane arrangements. For example, regression depth is the counterpart of Tukey depth. Motivated by this, we study general families of depth measures for hyperplane arrangements and show that all of them must have a deep point. Along the way we prove a Tverberg-type theorem for hyperplane arrangements, giving a positive answer to a conjecture by Rousseeuw and Hubert from 1999. We also get three new proofs of the centerpoint theorem for regression depth, all of which are either stronger or more general than the original proof by Amenta, Bern, Eppstein, and Teng. Finally, we prove a version of the center transversal theorem for regression depth.

 FibeRed: Fiberwise Dimensionality Reduction of Topologically Complex Data with Vector Bundles   
 Authors:  Luis Scoccola and Jose A. Perea  
  Abstract    
 Datasets with non-trivial large scale topology can be hard to embed in low-dimensional Euclidean space with existing dimensionality reduction algorithms. We propose to model topologically complex datasets using vector bundles, in such a way that the base space accounts for the large scale topology, while the fibers account for the local geometry. This allows one to reduce the dimensionality of the fibers, while preserving the large scale topology. We formalize this point of view and, as an application, we describe a dimensionality reduction algorithm based on topological inference for vector bundles. The algorithm takes as input a dataset together with an initial representation in Euclidean space, assumed to recover part of its large scale topology, and outputs a new representation that integrates local representations obtained through local linear dimensionality reduction. We demonstrate this algorithm on examples coming from dynamical systems and chemistry. In these examples, our algorithm is able to learn topologically faithful embeddings of the data in lower target dimension than various well known metric-based dimensionality reduction algorithms.

 Toroidal Coordinates: Decorrelating Circular Coordinates with Lattice Reduction   
 Authors:  Luis Scoccola, Hitesh Gakhar, Johnathan Bush, Nikolas Schonsheck, Tatum Rask, Ling Zhou, and Jose A. Perea  
  Abstract    
 The circular coordinates algorithm of de Silva, Morozov, and Vejdemo-Johansson takes as input a dataset together with a cohomology class representing a 1-dimensional hole in the data; the output is a map from the data into the circle that captures this hole, and that is of minimum energy in a suitable sense. However, when applied to several cohomology classes, the output circle-valued maps can be "geometrically correlated" even if the chosen cohomology classes are linearly independent. It is shown in the original work that less correlated maps can be obtained with suitable integer linear combinations of the cohomology classes, with the linear combinations being chosen by inspection. In this paper, we identify a formal notion of geometric correlation between circle-valued maps which, in the Riemannian manifold case, corresponds to the Dirichlet form, a bilinear form derived from the Dirichlet energy. We describe a systematic procedure for constructing low energy torus-valued maps on data, starting from a set of linearly independent cohomology classes. We showcase our procedure with computational examples. Our main algorithm is based on the Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovász algorithm from computational number theory.

 Topological Universality of the Art Gallery Problem   
 Authors:  Jack Stade and Jamie Tucker-Foltz  
  Abstract    
 We prove that any compact semi-algebraic set is homeomorphic to the solution space of some art gallery problem. Previous works have established similar universality theorems, but holding only up to homotopy equivalence, rather than homeomorphism, and prior to this work, the existence of art galleries even for simple spaces such as the Möbius strip or the three-holed torus were unknown. Our construction relies on an elegant and versatile gadget to copy guard positions with minimal overhead. It is simpler than previous constructions, consisting of a single rectangular room with convex slits cut out from the edges. We show that both the orientable and non-orientable surfaces of genus n admit galleries with only O(n) vertices.

 On Higher Dimensional Point Sets in General Position   
 Authors:  Andrew Suk and Ji Zeng  
  Abstract    
 A finite point set in ℝ^d is in general position if no d + 1 points lie on a common hyperplane. Let α_d(N) be the largest integer such that any set of N points in ℝ^d with no d + 2 members on a common hyperplane, contains a subset of size α_d(N) in general position. Using the method of hypergraph containers, Balogh and Solymosi showed that α₂(N) < N^{5/6 + o(1)}. In this paper, we also use the container method to obtain new upper bounds for α_d(N) when d ≥ 3. More precisely, we show that if d is odd, then α_d(N) < N^{1/2 + 1/(2d) + o(1)}, and if d is even, we have α_d(N) < N^{1/2 + 1/(d-1) + o(1)}. We also study the classical problem of determining the maximum number a(d,k,n) of points selected from the grid [n]^d such that no k + 2 members lie on a k-flat. For fixed d and k, we show that a(d,k,n)≤ O(n^{d/{2⌊(k+2)/4⌋}(1- 1/{2⌊(k+2)/4⌋d+1})}), which improves the previously best known bound of O(n^{d/⌊(k + 2)/2⌋}) due to Lefmann when k+2 is congruent to 0 or 1 mod 4.

 Slice, Simplify and Stitch: Topology-Preserving Simplification Scheme for Massive Voxel Data   
 Authors:  Hubert Wagner  
  Abstract    
 We focus on efficient computations of topological descriptors for voxel data. This type of data includes 2D greyscale images, 3D medical scans, but also higher-dimensional scalar fields arising from physical simulations. In recent years we have seen an increase in applications of topological methods for such data. However, computational issues remain an obstacle. We therefore propose a streaming scheme which simplifies large 3-dimensional voxel data - while provably retaining its persistent homology. We combine this scheme with an efficient boundary matrix reduction implementation, obtaining an end-to-end tool for persistent homology of large data. Computational experiments show its state-of-the-art performance. In particular, we are now able to robustly handle complex datasets with several billions voxels on a regular laptop. A software implementation called Cubicle is available as open-source: https://bitbucket.org/hubwag/cubicle.

 Maximum Overlap Area of a Convex Polyhedron and a Convex Polygon Under Translation   
 Authors:  Honglin Zhu and Hyuk Jun Kweon  
  Abstract    
 Let P be a convex polyhedron and Q be a convex polygon with n vertices in total in three-dimensional space. We present a deterministic algorithm that finds a translation vector v ∈ ℝ³ maximizing the overlap area |P ∩ (Q + v)| in O(n log² n) time. We then apply our algorithm to solve two related problems. We give an O(n log³ n) time algorithm that finds the maximum overlap area of three convex polygons with n vertices in total. We also give an O(n log² n) time algorithm that minimizes the symmetric difference of two convex polygons under scaling and translation.

 Godzilla Onions: A Skit and Applet to Explain Euclidean Half-Plane Fractional Cascading (Media Exposition)   
 Authors:  Richard Berger, Vincent Ha, David Kratz, Michael Lin, Jeremy Moyer, and Christopher J. Tralie  
  Abstract    
 We provide a skit and an applet to illustrate fractional cascading in the context of half-plane range search for points in the Euclidean plane, which takes O(log N + h) output-sensitive time. In the video, a group of news anchors struggles to find the correct data structure to efficiently send out an early warning to the residents of Philadelphia who will be overtaken by a marching line of Godzillas. After exploring several options, the group eventually settles on onions and fractional cascading, only to discover that they themselves are in the line of fire! In the applet, we show step by step details of preprocessing to build the onions with fractional cascading and the subsequent query of the "Godzilla line" against the onion layers. Our video skit and applet can be found at https://ctralie.github.io/GodzillaOnions/

 Interactive 2D Periodic Graphs (Media Exposition)   
 Authors:  Alexandra Camero and Ileana Streinu  
  Abstract    
 We present an educational web app for interactively drawing and editing 2D periodic graphs. The user defines the unit cell and the finite set of vertex and edge representatives, from which a sufficiently large fragment of the periodic graph is created for the visualization. The periodic graph can also be modified by applying several transformations, including isometries and relaxations of the unit cell. A finite representation of the infinite periodic graph can be saved in an external file as a quotient graph with Z²-marked edges. Its geometry is recorded using fractional (crystallographic) coordinates. The facial structure of non-crossing periodic graphs can be revealed by the user interactively selecting face representatives. An accompanying video demonstrates the functionality of the web application.

 Greedy Permutations and Finite Voronoi Diagrams (Media Exposition)   
 Authors:  Oliver A. Chubet, Paul Macnichol, Parth Parikh, Donald R. Sheehy, and Siddharth S. Sheth  
  Abstract    
 We illustrate the computation of a greedy permutation using finite Voronoi diagrams. We describe the neighbor graph, which is a sparse graph data structure that facilitates efficient point location to insert a new Voronoi cell. This data structure is not dependent on a Euclidean metric space. The greedy permutation is computed in O(nlog Δ) time for low-dimensional data using this method [Sariel Har-Peled and Manor Mendel, 2006; Donald R. Sheehy, 2020].

 Constructing Concise Convex Covers via Clique Covers (CG Challenge)   
 Authors:  Mikkel Abrahamsen, William Bille Meyling, and André Nusser  
  Abstract    
 This work describes the winning implementation of the CG:SHOP 2023 Challenge. The topic of the Challenge was the convex cover problem: given a polygon P (with holes), find a minimum-cardinality set of convex polygons whose union equals P. We use a three-step approach: (1) Create a suitable partition of P. (2) Compute a visibility graph of the pieces of the partition. (3) Solve a vertex clique cover problem on the visibility graph, from which we then derive the convex cover. This way we capture the geometric difficulty in the first step and the combinatorial difficulty in the third step.

 Shadoks Approach to Convex Covering (CG Challenge)   
 Authors:  Guilherme D. da Fonseca  
  Abstract    
 We describe the heuristics used by the Shadoks team in the CG:SHOP 2023 Challenge. The Challenge consists of 206 instances, each being a polygon with holes. The goal is to cover each instance polygon with a small number of convex polygons. Our general strategy is the following. We find a big collection of large (often maximal) convex polygons inside the instance polygon and then solve several set cover problems to find a small subset of the collection that covers the whole polygon.

 Redistricting as a computational geometry problem   
 In this talk I'll give an overview of how to think about elections and redistricting through graph partitions, with tools from computational geometry. One major element is the use of tree-based graph algorithms to efficiently generate samples; another part of the story is the use of topological data analysis to understand large samples.

 Multi-Agent Path Finding and Its Applications   
 The coordination of robots and other agents becomes more and more important for industry. For example, on the order of one thousand robots already navigate autonomously in Amazon fulfillment centers to move inventory pods all the way from their storage locations to the picking stations that need the products they store (and vice versa). Optimal path planning for these robots is NP-hard, yet one must find high-quality collision-free paths for them in real-time. Such multi-agent path-finding problems have been studied in different research communities, including robotics, artificial intelligence, and theoretical computer science, and were used as the challenge problem in SoCG 2021. In this talk, I will discuss different variants of multi-agent path-finding problems, cool ideas for both solving them and executing the resulting plans robustly, and several of their applications, including warehousing, manufacturing, autonomous driving, and pipe routing. I will also discuss how three Ph.D. students from my research group and one Ph.D. student from a collaborating research group at Monash University used multi-agent path-finding technology to win the NeurIPS-20 Flatland train scheduling competition. Our research on this topic has been funded by both NSF and Amazon Robotics.

 FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS  
 Eighteenth International Symposium on ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE and MATHEMATICS ISAIM 2024 https://isaim2024.cs.ou.edu/  January 8-10, 2024 Fort Lauderdale, Florida  
 PAPER SUBMISSION DEADLINE: Monday, October 9, 2023  
 The International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics (ISAIM) is a biennial meeting that fosters interactions between mathematics, theoretical computer science, and artificial intelligence. This is the fifteenth Symposium in the series, which is sponsored by Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence. We seek submissions of recent results with a particular emphasis on the foundations of AI and mathematical methods used in AI. Papers describing applications are also encouraged, but the focus should be on principled lessons learned from the development of the application. Traditionally, the Symposium attracts participants from a variety of disciplines, thereby providing a unique forum for scientific exchange. The three-day Symposium includes invited speakers, presentations of technical papers, and special topic sessions.  
 SPECIAL TOPIC INVITED SESSIONS:  
 o Boolean and pseudo-Boolean Functions -Organized by Endre Boros, Rutgers University, and Yves Crama, University of Liege  
 o Alternative Models for Fairness in AI -Organizers: John Hooker, Tae Wan Kim, and Derek Leben, Carnegie Mellon University  
 o Deep Reinforcement Learning Workshop: Bridging Theory and Practice -Organized by Abhishek Gupta, University of Washington, and Zhaorang Wang, Northwestern University  
 PAPER SUBMISSION:  
 Paper submission will be electronic via the submission link to OpenReview on the Paper Submission page of the Symposium website ( https://isaim2024.cs.ou.edu/  ). Papers must be formatted in accordance with the guidelines given there.  
 The submission deadline is Tuesday, October 9, 2023 (11:59PM PDT). Papers will be reviewed by members of the Program Committee. Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by Wednesday, November 8, 2023. Final versions of accepted papers, for inclusion in the conference electronic proceedings, are due by Wednesday, November 29, 2023.  
 Work that will have been published as of January 2024 should not be submitted to ISAIM unless it introduces a significant addition to the previously published work. However, the ISAIM web site proceedings are not archival, so papers submitted to ISAIM can be under review at the time of submission and can be submitted elsewhere after ISAIM.  
 Authors of a selected set of papers from the Symposium will be invited to submit full versions of their papers for inclusion in a special volume of the Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, published by Springer. Those invited submissions will be subject to refereeing at the usual standards of the journal, and authors will receive more details with the acceptance notice. Papers must of course be new and unpublished to be considered for the special volume.  
 Any questions regarding paper submission should be sent to the Program Committee Chairs (Claudio Gentile and Aldo Pacchiano) at the email address <isaim2024 AT cs DOT ou DOT edu>.  
 IMPORTANT DATES:  
 Paper submission: Tuesday, October 9, 2023 Notification: Wednesday, November 8, 2023 Final version due: Wednesday, November 29, 2023 Workshop: January 8-10, 2024, Ft. Lauderdale, Florida

 Colordag: An Incentive-Compatible Blockchain   
 Authors:  Ittai Abraham, Danny Dolev, Ittay Eyal, and Joseph Y. Halpern  
  Abstract    
 We present Colordag, a blockchain protocol where following the prescribed strategy is, with high probability, a best response as long as all miners have less than 1/2 of the mining power. We prove the correctness of Colordag even if there is an extremely powerful adversary who knows future actions of the scheduler: specifically, when agents will generate blocks and when messages will arrive. The state-of-the-art protocol, Fruitchain, is an ε-Nash equilibrium as long as all miners have less than 1/2 of the mining power. However, there is a simple deviation that guarantees that deviators are never worse off than they would be by following Fruitchain, and can sometimes do better. Thus, agents are motivated to deviate. Colordag implements a solution concept that we call ε-sure Nash equilibrium and does not suffer from this problem. Because it is an ε-sure Nash equilibrium, Colordag is an ε-Nash equilibrium and with probability 1-ε is a best response.

 Certified Round Complexity of Self-Stabilizing Algorithms   
 Authors:  Karine Altisen, Pierre Corbineau, and Stéphane Devismes  
  Abstract    
 A proof assistant is an appropriate tool to write sound proofs. The need of such tools in distributed computing grows over the years due to the scientific progress that leads algorithmic designers to consider always more difficult problems. In that spirit, the PADEC Coq library has been developed to certify self-stabilizing algorithms. Efficiency of self-stabilizing algorithms is mainly evaluated by comparing their stabilization times in rounds, the time unit that is primarily used in the self-stabilizing area. In this paper, we introduce the notion of rounds in the PADEC library together with several formal tools to help the certification of the complexity analysis of self-stabilizing algorithms. We validate our approach by certifying the stabilization time in rounds of the classical Dolev et al’s self-stabilizing Breadth-first Search spanning tree construction.

 Network Agnostic Perfectly Secure MPC Against General Adversaries   
 Authors:  Ananya Appan, Anirudh Chandramouli, and Ashish Choudhury  
  Abstract    
 In this work, we study perfectly-secure multi-party computation (MPC) against general (non-threshold) adversaries. Known protocols are secure against 𝒬^{(3)} and 𝒬^{(4)} adversary structures in a synchronous and an asynchronous network respectively. We address the existence of a single protocol which remains secure against 𝒬^{(3)} and 𝒬^{(4)} adversary structures in a synchronous and in an asynchronous network respectively, where the parties are unaware of the network type. We design the first such protocol against general adversaries. Our result generalizes the result of Appan, Chandramouli and Choudhury (PODC 2022), which presents such a protocol against threshold adversaries.

 One Step Forward, One Step Back: FLP-Style Proofs and the Round-Reduction Technique for Colorless Tasks   
 Authors:  Hagit Attiya, Pierre Fraigniaud, Ami Paz, and Sergio Rajsbaum  
  Abstract    
 The paper compares two generic techniques for deriving lower bounds and impossibility results in distributed computing. First, we prove a speedup theorem (a-la Brandt, 2019), for wait-free colorless algorithms, aiming at capturing the essence of the seminal round-reduction proof establishing a lower bound on the number of rounds for 3-coloring a cycle (Linial, 1992), and going by backward induction. Second, we consider FLP-style proofs, aiming at capturing the essence of the seminal consensus impossibility proof (Fischer, Lynch, and Paterson, 1985) and using forward induction. We show that despite their very different natures, these two forms of proof are tightly connected. In particular, we show that for every colorless task Π, if there is a round-reduction proof establishing the impossibility of solving Π using wait-free colorless algorithms, then there is an FLP-style proof establishing the same impossibility. For 1-dimensional colorless tasks (for an arbitrarily number n ≥ 2 of processes), we prove that the two proof techniques have exactly the same power, and more importantly, both are complete: if a 1-dimensional colorless task is not wait-free solvable by n ≥ 2 processes, then the impossibility can be proved by both proof techniques. Moreover, a round-reduction proof can be automatically derived, and an FLP-style proof can be automatically generated from it. Finally, we illustrate the use of these two techniques by establishing the impossibility of solving any colorless covering task of arbitrary dimension by wait-free algorithms.

 Topological Characterization of Task Solvability in General Models of Computation   
 Authors:  Hagit Attiya, Armando Castañeda, and Thomas Nowak  
  Abstract    
 The famous asynchronous computability theorem (ACT) relates the existence of an asynchronous wait-free shared memory protocol for solving a task with the existence of a simplicial map from a subdivision of the simplicial complex representing the inputs to the simplicial complex representing the allowable outputs. The original theorem relies on a correspondence between protocols and simplicial maps in round-structured models of computation that induce a compact topology. This correspondence, however, is far from obvious for computation models that induce a non-compact topology, and indeed previous attempts to extend the ACT have failed. This paper shows that in every non-compact model, protocols solving tasks correspond to simplicial maps that need to be continuous. It first proves a generalized ACT for sub-IIS models, some of which are non-compact, and applies it to the set agreement task. Then it proves that in general models too, protocols are simplicial maps that need to be continuous, hence showing that the topological approach is universal. Finally, it shows that the approach used in ACT that equates protocols and simplicial complexes actually works for every compact model. Our study combines, for the first time, combinatorial and point-set topological aspects of the executions admitted by the computation model.

 Base Fee Manipulation in Ethereum’s EIP-1559 Transaction Fee Mechanism   
 Authors:  Sarah Azouvi, Guy Goren, Lioba Heimbach, and Alexander Hicks  
  Abstract    
 In 2021 Ethereum adjusted the transaction pricing mechanism by implementing EIP-1559, which introduces the base fee - a network fee that is burned and dynamically adjusts to the network demand. The authors of the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) noted that a miner with more than 50% of the mining power could be incentivized to deviate from the honest mining strategy. Instead, such a miner could propose a series of empty blocks to artificially lower demand and increase her future rewards. In this paper, we generalize this attack and show that under rational player behavior, deviating from the honest strategy can be profitable for a miner with less than 50% of the mining power. We show that even when miners do not collaborate, it is at times rational for smaller miners to join the attack. Finally, we propose a mitigation to address the identified vulnerability.

 On the Node-Averaged Complexity of Locally Checkable Problems on Trees   
 Authors:  Alkida Balliu, Sebastian Brandt, Fabian Kuhn, Dennis Olivetti, and Gustav Schmid  
  Abstract    
 Over the past decade, a long line of research has investigated the distributed complexity landscape of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems on bounded-degree graphs, culminating in an almost-complete classification on general graphs and a complete classification on trees. The latter states that, on bounded-degree trees, any LCL problem has deterministic worst-case time complexity O(1), Θ(log^* n), Θ(log n), or Θ(n^{1/k}) for some positive integer k, and all of those complexity classes are nonempty. Moreover, randomness helps only for (some) problems with deterministic worst-case complexity Θ(log n), and if randomness helps (asymptotically), then it helps exponentially. In this work, we study how many distributed rounds are needed on average per node in order to solve an LCL problem on trees. We obtain a partial classification of the deterministic node-averaged complexity landscape for LCL problems. As our main result, we show that every problem with worst-case round complexity O(log n) has deterministic node-averaged complexity O(log^* n). We further establish bounds on the node-averaged complexity of problems with worst-case complexity Θ(n^{1/k}): we show that all these problems have node-averaged complexity Ω̃(n^{1 / (2^k - 1)}), and that this lower bound is tight for some problems.

 Treasure Hunt with Volatile Pheromones   
 Authors:  Evangelos Bampas, Joffroy Beauquier, Janna Burman, and William Guy--Obé  
  Abstract    
 In the treasure hunt problem, a team of mobile agents need to locate a single treasure that is hidden in their environment. We consider the problem in the discrete setting of an oriented infinite rectangular grid, where agents are modeled as synchronous identical deterministic time-limited finite-state automata, originating at a rate of one agent per round from the origin. Agents perish τ rounds after their creation, where τ ≥ 1 is a parameter of the model. An algorithm solves the treasure hunt problem if every grid position at distance τ or less from the origin is visited by at least one agent. Agents may communicate only by leaving indistinguishable traces (pheromone) on the nodes of the grid, which can be sensed by agents in adjacent nodes and thus modify their behavior. The novelty of our approach is that, in contrast to existing literature that uses permanent pheromone markers, we assume that pheromone traces evaporate over μ rounds from the moment they were placed on a node, where μ ≥ 1 is another parameter of the model. We look for uniform algorithms that solve the problem without knowledge of the parameter values, and we investigate the implications of this very weak communication mechanism to the treasure hunt problem. We show that, if pheromone persists for at least two rounds (μ ≥ 2), then there exists a treasure hunt algorithm for all values of agent lifetime. We also develop a more sophisticated algorithm that works for all values of μ, hence also for the fastest possible pheromone evaporation of μ = 1, but only if agent lifetime is at least 16.

 The FIDS Theorems: Tensions Between Multinode and Multicore Performance in Transactional Systems   
 Authors:  Naama Ben-David, Gal Sela, and Adriana Szekeres  
  Abstract    
 Traditionally, distributed and parallel transactional systems have been studied in isolation, as they targeted different applications and experienced different bottlenecks. However, modern high-bandwidth networks have made the study of systems that are both distributed (i.e., employ multiple nodes) and parallel (i.e., employ multiple cores per node) necessary to truly make use of the available hardware. In this paper, we study the performance of these combined systems and show that there are inherent tradeoffs between a system’s ability to have fast and robust distributed communication and its ability to scale to multiple cores. More precisely, we formalize the notions of a fast deciding path of communication to commit transactions quickly in good executions, and seamless fault tolerance that allows systems to remain robust to server failures. We then show that there is an inherent tension between these two natural distributed properties and well-known multicore scalability properties in transactional systems. Finally, we show positive results; it is possible to construct a parallel distributed transactional system if any one of the properties we study is removed.

 Communication Lower Bounds for Cryptographic Broadcast Protocols   
 Authors:  Erica Blum, Elette Boyle, Ran Cohen, and Chen-Da Liu-Zhang  
  Abstract    
 Broadcast protocols enable a set of n parties to agree on the input of a designated sender, even in the face of malicious parties who collude to attack the protocol. In the honest-majority setting, a fruitful line of work harnessed randomization and cryptography to achieve low-communication broadcast protocols with sub-quadratic total communication and with "balanced" sub-linear communication cost per party. However, comparatively little is known in the dishonest-majority setting. Here, the most communication-efficient constructions are based on the protocol of Dolev and Strong (SICOMP '83), and sub-quadratic broadcast has not been achieved even using randomization and cryptography. On the other hand, the only nontrivial ω(n) communication lower bounds are restricted to deterministic protocols, or against strong adaptive adversaries that can perform "after the fact" removal of messages. We provide communication lower bounds in this space, which hold against arbitrary cryptography and setup assumptions, as well as a simple protocol showing near tightness of our first bound. - Static adversary. We demonstrate a tradeoff between resiliency and communication for randomized protocols secure against n-o(n) static corruptions. For example, Ω(n⋅ polylog(n)) messages are needed when the number of honest parties is n/polylog(n); Ω(n√n) messages are needed for O(√n) honest parties; and Ω(n²) messages are needed for O(1) honest parties. Complementarily, we demonstrate broadcast with O(n⋅polylog(n)) total communication and balanced polylog(n) per-party cost, facing any constant fraction of static corruptions. - Weakly adaptive adversary. Our second bound considers n/2 + k corruptions and a weakly adaptive adversary that cannot remove messages "after the fact." We show that any broadcast protocol within this setting can be attacked to force an arbitrary party to send messages to k other parties. Our bound implies limitations on the feasibility of balanced low-communication protocols: For example, ruling out broadcast facing 51% corruptions, in which all non-sender parties have sublinear communication locality.

 Time and Space Optimal Massively Parallel Algorithm for the 2-Ruling Set Problem   
 Authors:  Mélanie Cambus, Fabian Kuhn, Shreyas Pai, and Jara Uitto  
  Abstract    
 In this work, we present a constant-round algorithm for the 2-ruling set problem in the Congested Clique model. As a direct consequence, we obtain a constant round algorithm in the MPC model with linear space-per-machine and optimal total space. Our results improve on the O(log log log n)-round algorithm by [HPS, DISC'14] and the O(log log Δ)-round algorithm by [GGKMR, PODC'18]. Our techniques can also be applied to the semi-streaming model to obtain an O(1)-pass algorithm. Our main technical contribution is a novel sampling procedure that returns a small subgraph such that almost all nodes in the input graph are adjacent to the sampled subgraph. An MIS on the sampled subgraph provides a 2-ruling set for a large fraction of the input graph. As a technical challenge, we must handle the remaining part of the graph, which might still be relatively large. We overcome this challenge by showing useful structural properties of the remaining graph and show that running our process twice yields a 2-ruling set of the original input graph with high probability.

 Self-Stabilizing Clock Synchronization in Probabilistic Networks   
 Authors:  Bernadette Charron-Bost and Louis Penet de Monterno  
  Abstract    
 We consider the fundamental problem of clock synchronization in a synchronous multi-agent system. Each agent holds a clock with an arbitrary initial value, and clocks must eventually indicate the same value, modulo some integer P. A known solution for this problem in dynamic networks is the self-stabilization SAP (for self-adaptive period) algorithm, which uses finite memory and relies solely on the assumption of a finite dynamic diameter in the communication network. This paper extends the results on this algorithm to probabilistic communication networks: We introduce the concept of strong connectivity with high probability and we demonstrate that in any probabilistic communication network satisfying this hypothesis, the SAP algorithm synchronizes clocks with high probability. The proof of such a probabilistic hyperproperty is based on novel tools and relies on weak assumptions about the probabilistic communication network, making it applicable to a wide range of networks, including the classical push model. We provide an upper bound on time and space complexity. Building upon previous works by Feige et al. and Pittel, the paper provides solvability results and evaluates the stabilization time and space complexity of SAP in two specific cases of communication topologies.

 Every Bit Counts in Consensus   
 Authors:  Pierre Civit, Seth Gilbert, Rachid Guerraoui, Jovan Komatovic, Matteo Monti, and Manuel Vidigueira  
  Abstract    
 Consensus enables n processes to agree on a common valid L-bit value, despite t < n/3 processes being faulty and acting arbitrarily. A long line of work has been dedicated to improving the worst-case communication complexity of consensus in partial synchrony. This has recently culminated in the worst-case word complexity of O(n²). However, the worst-case bit complexity of the best solution is still O(n²L + n²κ) (where κ is the security parameter), far from the Ω(nL + n²) lower bound. The gap is significant given the practical use of consensus primitives, where values typically consist of batches of large size (L > n). This paper shows how to narrow the aforementioned gap. Namely, we present a new algorithm, DARE (Disperse, Agree, REtrieve), that improves upon the O(n²L) term via a novel dispersal primitive. DARE achieves O(n^{1.5}L + n^{2.5}κ) bit complexity, an effective √n-factor improvement over the state-of-the-art (when L > nκ). Moreover, we show that employing heavier cryptographic primitives, namely STARK proofs, allows us to devise DARE-Stark, a version of DARE which achieves the near-optimal bit complexity of O(nL + n²poly(κ)). Both DARE and DARE-Stark achieve optimal O(n) worst-case latency.

 Efficient Collaborative Tree Exploration with Breadth-First Depth-Next   
 Authors:  Romain Cosson, Laurent Massoulié, and Laurent Viennot  
  Abstract    
 We study the problem of collaborative tree exploration introduced by Fraigniaud, Gasieniec, Kowalski, and Pelc [Pierre Fraigniaud et al., 2006] where a team of k agents is tasked to collectively go through all the edges of an unknown tree as fast as possible and return to the root. Denoting by n the total number of nodes and by D the tree depth, the 𝒪(n/log(k)+D) algorithm of [Pierre Fraigniaud et al., 2006] achieves a 𝒪(k/log(k)) competitive ratio with respect to the cost of offline exploration which is at least max{{2n/k,2D}}. Brass, Cabrera-Mora, Gasparri, and Xiao [Peter Brass et al., 2011] study an alternative performance criterion, the competitive overhead with respect to the cost of offline exploration, with their 2n/k+𝒪((D+k)^k) guarantee. In this paper, we introduce "Breadth-First Depth-Next" (BFDN), a novel and simple algorithm that performs collaborative tree exploration in 2n/k+𝒪(D²log(k)) rounds, thus outperforming [Peter Brass et al., 2011] for all values of (n,D,k) and being order-optimal for trees of depth D = o(√n). Our analysis relies on a two-player game reflecting a problem of online resource allocation that could be of independent interest. We extend the guarantees of BFDN to: scenarios with limited memory and communication, adversarial setups where robots can be blocked, and exploration of classes of non-tree graphs. Finally, we provide a recursive version of BFDN with a runtime of 𝒪_𝓁(n/k^{1/𝓁}+log(k) D^{1+1/𝓁}) for parameter 𝓁 ≥ 1, thereby improving performance for trees with large depth.

 A Topology by Geometrization for Sub-Iterated Immediate Snapshot Message Adversaries and Applications to Set-Agreement   
 Authors:  Yannis Coutouly and Emmanuel Godard  
  Abstract    
 The Iterated Immediate Snapshot model (IIS) is a central model in the message adversary setting. We consider general message adversaries whose executions are arbitrary subsets of the executions of the IIS message adversary. We present a complete and explicit characterization and lower bounds for solving set-agreement for general sub-IIS message adversaries. In order to have this characterization, we introduce a new topological approach for such general adversaries, closely associating executions to geometric simplicial complexes. This way, it is possible to define and explicitly construct a topology directly on the considered sets of executions. We believe this topology by geometrization to be of independent interest and a good candidate to investigate distributed computability in general sub-IIS message adversaries, as this could provide both simpler and more powerful ways of using topology for distributed computability.

 Send/Receive Patterns Versus Read/Write Patterns in Crash-Prone Asynchronous Distributed Systems   
 Authors:  Mathilde Déprés, Achour Mostéfaoui, Matthieu Perrin, and Michel Raynal  
  Abstract    
 This paper is on the power and computability limits of messages patterns in crash-prone asynchronous message-passing systems. It proposes and investigates three basic messages patterns (encountered in all these systems) each involving two processes, and compares them to their Read/Write counterparts. It is first shown that one of these patterns has no Read/Write counterpart. The paper proposes then a new one-to-all broadcast abstraction, denoted Mutual Broadcast (in short MBroadcast), whose implementation relies on two of the previous messages patterns. This abstraction provides each pair of processes with the following property (called mutual ordering): for any pair of processes p and p', if p broadcasts a message m and p' broadcasts a message m', it is not possible for p to deliver first (its message) m and then m' while p' delivers first (its message) m' and then m. It is shown that MBroadcast and atomic Read/Write registers have the same computability power (independently of the number of crashes). Finally, in addition to its theoretical contribution, the practical interest of MBroadcast is illustrated by its (very simple) use to solve basic upper level coordination problems such as mutual exclusion and consensus. Last but not least, looking for simplicity was also a target of this article.

 Modular Recoverable Mutual Exclusion Under System-Wide Failures   
 Authors:  Sahil Dhoked, Wojciech Golab, and Neeraj Mittal  
  Abstract    
 Recoverable mutual exclusion (RME) is a fault-tolerant variation of Dijkstra’s classic mutual exclusion (ME) problem that allows processes to fail by crashing as long as they recover eventually. A growing body of literature on this topic, starting with the problem formulation by Golab and Ramaraju (PODC'16), examines the cost of solving the RME problem, which is quantified by counting the expensive shared memory operations called remote memory references (RMRs), under a variety of conditions. Published results show that the RMR complexity of RME algorithms, among other factors, depends crucially on the failure model used: individual process versus system-wide. Recent work by Golab and Hendler (PODC'18) also suggests that explicit failure detection can be helpful in attaining constant RMR solutions to the RME problem in the system-wide failure model. Follow-up work by Jayanti, Jayanti, and Joshi (SPAA'23) shows that such a solution exists even without employing a failure detector, albeit this solution uses a more complex algorithmic approach. In this work, we dive deeper into the study of RMR-optimal RME algorithms for the system-wide failure model, and present contributions along multiple directions. First, we introduce the notion of withdrawing from a lock acquisition rather than resetting the lock. We use this notion to design a withdrawable RME algorithm with optimal O(1) RMR complexity for both cache-coherent (CC) and distributed shared memory (DSM) models in a modular way without using an explicit failure detector. In some sense, our technique marries the simplicity of Golab and Hendler’s algorithm with Jayanti, Jayanti and Joshi’s weaker system model. Second, we present a variation of our algorithm that supports fully dynamic process participation (i.e., both joining and leaving) in the CC model, while maintaining its constant RMR complexity. We show experimentally that our algorithm is substantially faster than Jayanti, Jayanti, and Joshi’s algorithm despite having stronger correctness properties. Finally, we establish an impossibility result for fully dynamic RME algorithms with bounded RMR complexity in the DSM model that are adaptive with respect to space, and provide a wait-free withdraw section.

 Optimal Computation in Leaderless and Multi-Leader Disconnected Anonymous Dynamic Networks   
 Authors:  Giuseppe A. Di Luna and Giovanni Viglietta  
  Abstract    
 We give a simple characterization of which functions can be computed deterministically by anonymous processes in dynamic networks, depending on the number of leaders in the network. In addition, we provide efficient distributed algorithms for computing all such functions assuming minimal or no knowledge about the network. Each of our algorithms comes in two versions: one that terminates with the correct output and a faster one that stabilizes on the correct output without explicit termination. Notably, these are the first deterministic algorithms whose running times scale linearly with both the number of processes and a parameter of the network which we call dynamic disconnectivity (meaning that our dynamic networks do not necessarily have to be connected at all times). We also provide matching lower bounds, showing that all our algorithms are asymptotically optimal for any fixed number of leaders. While most of the existing literature on anonymous dynamic networks relies on classical mass-distribution techniques, our work makes use of a recently introduced combinatorial structure called history tree, also developing its theory in new directions. Among other contributions, our results make definitive progress on two popular fundamental problems for anonymous dynamic networks: leaderless Average Consensus (i.e., computing the mean value of input numbers distributed among the processes) and multi-leader Counting (i.e., determining the exact number of processes in the network). In fact, our approach unifies and improves upon several independent lines of research on anonymous networks, including Nedić et al., IEEE Trans. Automat. Contr. 2009; Olshevsky, SIAM J. Control Optim. 2017; Kowalski-Mosteiro, ICALP 2019, SPAA 2021; Di Luna-Viglietta, FOCS 2022.

 Fast Coloring Despite Congested Relays   
 Authors:  Maxime Flin, Magnús M. Halldórsson, and Alexandre Nolin  
  Abstract    
 We provide a O(log⁶ log n)-round randomized algorithm for distance-2 coloring in CONGEST with Δ²+1 colors. For Δ≫polylog n, this improves exponentially on the O(logΔ+polylog log n) algorithm of [Halldórsson, Kuhn, Maus, Nolin, DISC'20].

 Distributed Certification for Classes of Dense Graphs   
 Authors:  Pierre Fraigniaud, Frédéric Mazoit, Pedro Montealegre, Ivan Rapaport, and Ioan Todinca  
  Abstract    
 A proof-labeling scheme (PLS) for a boolean predicate Π on labeled graphs is a mechanism used for certifying the legality with respect to Π of global network states in a distributed manner. In a PLS, a certificate is assigned to each processing node of the network, and the nodes are in charge of checking that the collection of certificates forms a global proof that the system is in a correct state, by exchanging the certificates once, between neighbors only. The main measure of complexity is the size of the certificates. Many PLSs have been designed for certifying specific predicates, including cycle-freeness, minimum-weight spanning tree, planarity, etc. In 2021, a breakthrough has been obtained, as a "meta-theorem" stating that a large set of properties have compact PLSs in a large class of networks. Namely, for every MSO₂ property Π on labeled graphs, there exists a PLS for Π with O(log n)-bit certificates for all graphs of bounded tree-depth. This result has been extended to the larger class of graphs with bounded tree-width, using certificates on O(log² n) bits. We extend this result even further, to the larger class of graphs with bounded clique-width, which, as opposed to the other two aforementioned classes, includes dense graphs. We show that, for every MSO₁ property Π on labeled graphs, there exists a PLS for Π with O(log² n)-bit certificates for all graphs of bounded clique-width. As a consequence, certifying families of graphs such as distance-hereditary graphs and (induced) P₄-free graphs (a.k.a., cographs) can be done using a PLS with O(log² n)-bit certificates, merely because each of these two classes can be specified in MSO₁. In fact, we show that certifying P₄-free graphs can be done with certificates on O(log n) bits only. This is in contrast to the class of C₄-free graphs (which does not have bounded clique-width) which requires Ω̃(√n)-bit certificates.

 The Synchronization Power (Consensus Number) of Access-Control Objects: the Case of AllowList and DenyList   
 Authors:  Davide Frey, Mathieu Gestin, and Michel Raynal  
  Abstract    
 This article studies the synchronization power of AllowList and DenyList objects under the lens provided by Herlihy’s consensus hierarchy. It specifies AllowList and DenyList as distributed objects and shows that, while they can both be seen as specializations of a more general object type, they inherently have different synchronization power. While the AllowList object does not require synchronization between participating processes, a DenyList object requires processes to reach consensus on a specific set of processes. These results are then applied to a more global analysis of anonymity-preserving systems that use AllowList and DenyList objects. First, a blind-signature-based e-voting is presented. Second, DenyList and AllowList objects are used to determine the consensus number of a specific decentralized key management system. Third, an anonymous money transfer algorithm using the association of AllowList and DenyList objects is presented. Finally, this analysis is used to study the properties of these application, and to highlight efficiency gains that they can achieve in message passing environment.

 List Defective Colorings: Distributed Algorithms and Applications   
 Authors:  Marc Fuchs and Fabian Kuhn  
  Abstract    
 The distributed coloring problem is at the core of the area of distributed graph algorithms and it is a problem that has seen tremendous progress over the last few years. Much of the remarkable recent progress on deterministic distributed coloring algorithms is based on two main tools: a) defective colorings in which every node of a given color can have a limited number of neighbors of the same color and b) list coloring, a natural generalization of the standard coloring problem that naturally appears when colorings are computed in different stages and one has to extend a previously computed partial coloring to a full coloring. In this paper, we introduce list defective colorings, which can be seen as a generalization of these two coloring variants. Essentially, in a list defective coloring instance, each node v is given a list of colors x_{v,1},… ,x_{v,p} together with a list of defects d_{v,1},… ,d_{v,p} such that if v is colored with color x_{v, i}, it is allowed to have at most d_{v, i} neighbors with color x_{v, i}. We highlight the important role of list defective colorings by showing that faster list defective coloring algorithms would directly lead to faster deterministic (Δ+1)-coloring algorithms in the LOCAL model. Further, we extend a recent distributed list coloring algorithm by Maus and Tonoyan [DISC '20]. Slightly simplified, we show that if for each node v it holds that ∑_{i=1}^p (d_{v,i}+1)² > deg_G²(v)⋅ polylogΔ then this list defective coloring instance can be solved in a communication-efficient way in only O(logΔ) communication rounds. This leads to the first deterministic (Δ+1)-coloring algorithm in the standard CONGEST model with a time complexity of O(√{Δ}⋅ polylog Δ+log^* n), matching the best time complexity in the LOCAL model up to a polylogΔ factor.

 Conditionally Optimal Parallel Coloring of Forests   
 Authors:  Christoph Grunau, Rustam Latypov, Yannic Maus, Shreyas Pai, and Jara Uitto  
  Abstract    
 We show the first conditionally optimal deterministic algorithm for 3-coloring forests in the low-space massively parallel computation (MPC) model. Our algorithm runs in O(log log n) rounds and uses optimal global space. The best previous algorithm requires 4 colors [Ghaffari, Grunau, Jin, DISC'20] and is randomized, while our algorithm are inherently deterministic. Our main technical contribution is an O(log log n)-round algorithm to compute a partition of the forest into O(log n) ordered layers such that every node has at most two neighbors in the same or higher layers. Similar decompositions are often used in the area and we believe that this result is of independent interest. Our results also immediately yield conditionally optimal deterministic algorithms for maximal independent set and maximal matching for forests, matching the state of the art [Giliberti, Fischer, Grunau, SPAA'23]. In contrast to their solution, our algorithms are not based on derandomization, and are arguably simpler.

 On the Inherent Anonymity of Gossiping   
 Authors:  Rachid Guerraoui, Anne-Marie Kermarrec, Anastasiia Kucherenko, Rafael Pinot, and Sasha Voitovych  
  Abstract    
 Detecting the source of a gossip is a critical issue, related to identifying patient zero in an epidemic, or the origin of a rumor in a social network. Although it is widely acknowledged that random and local gossip communications make source identification difficult, there exists no general quantification of the level of anonymity provided to the source. This paper presents a principled method based on ε-differential privacy to analyze the inherent source anonymity of gossiping for a large class of graphs. First, we quantify the fundamental limit of source anonymity any gossip protocol can guarantee in an arbitrary communication graph. In particular, our result indicates that when the graph has poor connectivity, no gossip protocol can guarantee any meaningful level of differential privacy. This prompted us to further analyze graphs with controlled connectivity. We prove on these graphs that a large class of gossip protocols, namely cobra walks, offers tangible differential privacy guarantees to the source. In doing so, we introduce an original proof technique based on the reduction of a gossip protocol to what we call a random walk with probabilistic die out. This proof technique is of independent interest to the gossip community and readily extends to other protocols inherited from the security community, such as the Dandelion protocol. Interestingly, our tight analysis precisely captures the trade-off between dissemination time of a gossip protocol and its source anonymity.

 Durable Algorithms for Writable LL/SC and CAS with Dynamic Joining   
 Authors:  Prasad Jayanti, Siddhartha Jayanti, and Sucharita Jayanti  
  Abstract    
 We present durable implementations for two well known universal primitives - CAS (compare-and-swap), and its ABA-free counter-part LLSC (load-linked, store-conditional). Our implementations satisfy method-based recoverable linearizability (MRL) and method-based detectability (M-detectability) - novel correctness conditions that require only a simple usage pattern to guarantee resilience to individual process crashes (and system-wide crashes), including in implementations with nesting. Additionally, our implementations are: writable, meaning they support a Write() operation; have constant time complexity per operation; allow for dynamic joining, meaning newly created processes (a.k.a. threads) of arbitrary names can join a protocol and access our implementations; and have adaptive space complexity, meaning the space use scales in the number of processes n that actually use the objects, as opposed to previous protocols whose space complexity depends on N, the maximum number of processes that the protocol is designed for. Our durable Writable-CAS implementation, DuraCAS, requires O(m + n) space to support m objects that get accessed by n processes, improving on the state-of-the-art O(m + N²). By definition, LLSC objects must store "contexts" in addition to object values. Our Writable-LLSC implementation, DuraLL, requires O(m + n + C) space, where C is the number of "contexts" stored across all the objects. While LLSC has an advantage over CAS due to being ABA-free, the object definition seems to require additional space usage. To address this trade-off, we define an External Context (EC) variant of LLSC. Our EC Writable-LLSC implementation is ABA-free and has a space complexity of just O(m + n). To our knowledge, our algorithms are the first durable CAS algorithms that allow for dynamic joining, and are the first to exhibit adaptive space complexity. To our knowledge, we are the first to implement any type of durable LLSC objects.

 Cordial Miners: Fast and Efficient Consensus for Every Eventuality   
 Authors:  Idit Keidar, Oded Naor, Ouri Poupko, and Ehud Shapiro  
  Abstract    
 Cordial Miners are a family of efficient Byzantine Atomic Broadcast protocols, with instances for asynchrony and eventual synchrony. They improve the latency of state-of-the-art DAG-based protocols by almost 2× and achieve optimal good-case complexity of O(n) by forgoing Reliable Broadcast as a building block. Rather, Cordial Miners use the blocklace - a partially-ordered counterpart of the totally-ordered blockchain data structure - to implement the three algorithmic components of consensus: Dissemination, equivocation-exclusion, and ordering.

 Fast Reconfiguration for Programmable Matter   
 Authors:  Irina Kostitsyna, Tom Peters, and Bettina Speckmann  
  Abstract    
 The concept of programmable matter envisions a very large number of tiny and simple robot particles forming a smart material. Even though the particles are restricted to local communication, local movement, and simple computation, their actions can nevertheless result in the global change of the material’s physical properties and geometry. A fundamental algorithmic task for programmable matter is to achieve global shape reconfiguration by specifying local behavior of the particles. In this paper we describe a new approach for shape reconfiguration in the amoebot model. The amoebot model is a distributed model which significantly restricts memory, computing, and communication capacity of the individual particles. Thus the challenge lies in coordinating the actions of particles to produce the desired behavior of the global system. Our reconfiguration algorithm is the first algorithm that does not use a canonical intermediate configuration when transforming between arbitrary shapes. We introduce new geometric primitives for amoebots and show how to reconfigure particle systems, using these primitives, in a linear number of activation rounds in the worst case. In practice, our method exploits the geometry of the symmetric difference between input and output shape: it minimizes unnecessary disassembly and reassembly of the particle system when the symmetric difference between the initial and the target shapes is small. Furthermore, our reconfiguration algorithm moves the particles over as many parallel shortest paths as the problem instance allows.

 Quorum Subsumption for Heterogeneous Quorum Systems   
 Authors:  Xiao Li, Eric Chan, and Mohsen Lesani  
  Abstract    
 Byzantine quorum systems provide higher throughput than proof-of-work and incur modest energy consumption. Further, their modern incarnations incorporate personalized and heterogeneous trust. Thus, they are emerging as an appealing candidate for global financial infrastructure. However, since their quorums are not uniform across processes anymore, the properties that they should maintain to support abstractions such as reliable broadcast and consensus are not well-understood. It has been shown that the two properties quorum intersection and availability are necessary. In this paper, we prove that they are not sufficient. We then define the notion of quorum subsumption, and show that the three conditions together are sufficient: we present reliable broadcast and consensus protocols, and prove their correctness for quorum systems that provide the three properties.

 Fast Deterministic Rendezvous in Labeled Lines   
 Authors:  Avery Miller and Andrzej Pelc  
  Abstract    
 Two mobile agents, starting from different nodes of a network modeled as a graph, and woken up at possibly different times, have to meet at the same node. This problem is known as rendezvous. Agents move in synchronous rounds. In each round, an agent can either stay idle or move to an adjacent node. We consider deterministic rendezvous in the infinite line, i.e., the infinite graph with all nodes of degree 2. Each node has a distinct label which is a positive integer. An agent currently located at a node can see its label and both ports 0 and 1 at the node. The time of rendezvous is the number of rounds until meeting, counted from the starting round of the earlier agent. We consider three scenarios. In the first scenario, each agent knows its position in the line, i.e., each of them knows its initial distance from the smallest-labeled node, on which side of this node it is located, and the direction towards it. For this scenario, we design a rendezvous algorithm working in time O(D), where D is the initial distance between the agents. This complexity is clearly optimal. In the second scenario, each agent knows a priori only the label of its starting node and the initial distance D between them. In this scenario, we design a rendezvous algorithm working in time O(Dlog^*𝓁), where 𝓁 is the larger label of the starting nodes. We also prove a matching lower bound Ω(Dlog^*𝓁). Finally, in the most general scenario, where each agent knows a priori only the label of its starting node, we design a rendezvous algorithm working in time O(D²(log^*𝓁)³), which is thus at most cubic in the lower bound. All our results remain valid (with small changes) for arbitrary finite lines and for cycles. Our algorithms are drastically better than approaches that use graph exploration, which have running times that depend on the size or diameter of the graph. Our main methodological tool, and the main novelty of the paper, is a two way reduction: from fast colouring of the infinite labeled line using a constant number of colours in the LOCAL model to fast rendezvous in this line, and vice-versa. In one direction we use fast node colouring to quickly break symmetry between the identical agents. In the other direction, a lower bound on colouring time implies a lower bound on the time of breaking symmetry between the agents, and hence a lower bound on their meeting time.

 Null Messages, Information and Coordination   
 Authors:  Raïssa Nataf, Guy Goren, and Yoram Moses  
  Abstract    
 This paper investigates the role that null messages play in synchronous systems with and without failures, and provides necessary and sufficient conditions on the structure of protocols for information transfer and coordination there. We start by introducing a new and more refined definition of null messages. A generalization of message chains that allow these null messages is provided, and is shown to be necessary and sufficient for information transfer in reliable systems. Coping with crash failures requires a much richer structure, since not receiving a message may be the result of the sender’s failure. We introduce a class of communication patterns called resilient message blocks, which impose a stricter condition on protocols than the silent choirs of Goren and Moses (2020). Such blocks are shown to be necessary for information transfer in crash-prone systems. Moreover, they are sufficient in several cases of interest, in which silent choirs are not. Finally, a particular combination of resilient message blocks is shown to be necessary and sufficient for solving the Ordered Response coordination problem.

 Gorilla: Safe Permissionless Byzantine Consensus   
 Authors:  Youer Pu, Ali Farahbakhsh, Lorenzo Alvisi, and Ittay Eyal  
  Abstract    
 Nakamoto’s consensus protocol works in a permissionless model and tolerates Byzantine failures, but only offers probabilistic agreement. Recently, the Sandglass protocol has shown such weaker guarantees are not a necessary consequence of a permissionless model; yet, Sandglass only tolerates benign failures, and operates in an unconventional partially synchronous model. We present Gorilla Sandglass, the first Byzantine tolerant consensus protocol to guarantee, in the same synchronous model adopted by Nakamoto, deterministic agreement and termination with probability 1 in a permissionless setting. We prove the correctness of Gorilla by mapping executions that would violate agreement or termination in Gorilla to executions in Sandglass, where we know such violations are impossible. Establishing termination proves particularly interesting, as the mapping requires reasoning about infinite executions and their probabilities.

 Distributed Sketching Lower Bounds for k-Edge Connected Spanning Subgraphs, BFS Trees, and LCL Problems   
 Authors:  Peter Robinson  
  Abstract    
 We investigate graph problems in the distributed sketching model, where each node sends a single message to a referee who computes the output. We define a class of graphs and give a framework for proving lower bounds for certain embeddable problems, which leads to several new results: First, we present a tight lower bound of Ω(n) bits for the message size of computing a breadth-first search (BFS) tree. For locally-checkable labeling (LCL) problems, we show that verifying whether a given vertex labeling forms a weak 2-coloring requires messages of Ω(n^{1/3}log^{2/3}n) bits, and the same lower bound holds for verifying whether a subset of nodes forms a maximal independent set. We also prove that computing a k-edge connected spanning subgraph (k-ECSS) requires messages of size at least Ω(klog²(n/k)), which is tight up to a logarithmic factor. To show these results, we define a simultaneous multiparty (SMP) model of communication complexity, where the players obtain certain subgraphs as their input, and develop a generic embedding argument that allows us to prove lower bounds for the graph sketching model by using reductions from the SMP model. We point out that these results also extend to single-round algorithms in the broadcast congested clique. We also (nearly) settle the space complexity of the k-ECSS problem in the streaming model by extending the work of Kapralov, Nelson, Pachoki, Wang, and Woodruff (FOCS 2017): We prove a communication complexity lower bound for a direct sum variant of the UR^⊂_k problem and show that this implies Ω(k nlog²(n/k)) bits of memory for computing a k-ECSS. This is known to be optimal up to a logarithmic factor.

 Memory-Anonymous Starvation-Free Mutual Exclusion: Possibility and Impossibility Results   
 Authors:  Gadi Taubenfeld  
  Abstract    
 In an anonymous shared memory system, all inter-process communications are via shared objects; however, unlike in standard systems, there is no a priori agreement between processes on the names of shared objects [G. Taubenfeld, 2017; G. Taubenfeld, 2022]. Furthermore, the algorithms are required to be symmetric; that is, the processes should execute precisely the same code, and the only way to distinguish processes is by comparing identifiers for equality. For such a system, read/write registers are called anonymous registers. It is known that symmetric deadlock-free mutual exclusion is solvable for any finite number of processes using anonymous registers [Z. Aghazadeh et al., 2019]. The main question left open in [G. Taubenfeld, 2017; G. Taubenfeld, 2022] is the existence of starvation-free mutual exclusion algorithms for two or more processes. We resolve this open question for memoryless algorithms, in which a process that tries to enter its critical section does not use any information about its previous attempts. Almost all known mutual exclusion algorithms are memoryless. We show that, 1) There is a symmetric memoryless starvation-free mutual exclusion algorithm for two processes using m ≥ 7 anonymous registers if and only if m is odd. 2) There is no symmetric memoryless starvation-free mutual exclusion algorithm for n ≥ 3 processes using (any number of) anonymous registers. Our impossibility result is the only example of a system with fault-free processes, where global progress (i.e., deadlock-freedom) can be ensured, while individual progress to each process (i.e., starvation-freedom) cannot. It complements a known result for systems with failure-prone processes, that there are objects with lock-free implementations but without wait-free implementations [H. Attiya et al., 2022; M. Herlihy, 1991].

 Improved and Partially-Tight Lower Bounds for Message-Passing Implementations of Multiplicity Queues   
 Authors:  Anh Tran and Edward Talmage  
  Abstract    
 A multiplicity queue is a concurrently-defined data type which relaxes the conditions of a linearizable FIFO queue to allow concurrent Dequeue instances to return the same value. It would seem that this should allow faster message-passing implementations, as processes should not need to wait as long to learn about concurrent operations at remote processes and previous work has shown that multiplicity queues are computationally less complex than the unrelaxed version. Intriguingly, other work has shown that there is, in fact, not much speedup possible versus an unrelaxed queue implementation. Seeking to understand this difference between intuition and real behavior, we improve the existing lower bound for uniform algorithms. We also give an upper bound for a special case to show that our bound is tight at that point. To achieve our lower bounds, we use extended shifting arguments, which are rarely used. We use these techniques in series of inductive indistinguishability proofs, extending our proofs beyond the usual limitations of traditional shifting arguments. This proof structure is an interesting contribution independently of the main result, as new lower bound proof techniques may have many uses in future work.

 Brief Announcement: BatchBoost: Universal Batching for Concurrent Data Structures   
 Authors:  Vitaly Aksenov, Michael Anoprenko, Alexander Fedorov, and Michael Spear  
  Abstract    
 Batching is a technique that stores multiple keys/values in each node of a data structure. In sequential search data structures, batching reduces latency by reducing the number of cache misses and shortening the chain of pointers to dereference. Applying batching to concurrent data structures is challenging, because it is difficult to maintain the search property and keep contention low in the presence of batching. In this paper, we present a general methodology for leveraging batching in concurrent search data structures, called BatchBoost. BatchBoost builds a search data structure from distinct "data" and "index" layers. The data layer’s purpose is to store a batch of key/value pairs in each of its nodes. The index layer uses an unmodified concurrent search data structure to route operations to a position in the data layer that is "close" to where the corresponding key should exist. The requirements on the index and data layers are low: with minimal effort, we were able to compose three highly scalable concurrent search data structures based on three original data structures as the index layers with a batched version of the Lazy List as the data layer. The resulting BatchBoost data structures provide significant performance improvements over their original counterparts.

 Brief Announcement: Multi-Valued Connected Consensus: A New Perspective on Crusader Agreement and Adopt-Commit   
 Authors:  Hagit Attiya and Jennifer L. Welch  
  Abstract    
 Algorithms to solve fault-tolerant consensus in asynchronous systems often rely on primitives such as crusader agreement, adopt-commit, and graded broadcast, which provide weaker agreement properties than consensus. Although these primitives have a similar flavor, they have been defined and implemented separately in ad hoc ways. We propose a new problem called connected consensus that has as special cases crusader agreement, adopt-commit, and graded broadcast, and generalizes them to handle multi-valued (non-binary) inputs. The generalization is accomplished by relating the problem to approximate agreement on graphs. We present three algorithms for multi-valued connected consensus in asynchronous message-passing systems, one tolerating crash failures and two tolerating malicious (unauthenticated Byzantine) failures. We extend the definition of binding, a desirable property recently identified as supporting binary consensus algorithms that are correct against adaptive adversaries, to the multi-valued input case and show that all our algorithms satisfy the property. Our crash-resilient algorithm has failure-resilience and time complexity that we show are optimal. When restricted to the case of binary inputs, the algorithm has improved time complexity over prior algorithms. Our two algorithms for malicious failures trade off failure resilience and time complexity. The first algorithm has time complexity that we prove is optimal but worse failure-resilience, while the second has failure-resilience that we prove is optimal but worse time complexity. When restricted to the case of binary inputs, the time complexity (as well as resilience) of the second algorithm matches that of prior algorithms.

 Brief Announcement: Relations Between Space-Bounded and Adaptive Massively Parallel Computations   
 Authors:  Michael Chen, A. Pavan, and N. V. Vinodchandran  
  Abstract    
 In this work, we study the class of problems solvable by (deterministic) Adaptive Massively Parallel Computations in constant rounds from a computational complexity theory perspective. A language L is in the class AMPC⁰ if, for every ε > 0, there is a deterministic AMPC algorithm running in constant rounds with a polynomial number of processors, where the local memory of each machine s = O(N^ε). We prove that the space-bounded complexity class ReachUL is a proper subclass of AMPC⁰. The complexity class ReachUL lies between the well-known space-bounded complexity classes Deterministic Logspace (DLOG) and Nondeterministic Logspace (NLOG). In contrast, we establish that it is unlikely that PSPACE admits AMPC algorithms, even with polynomially many rounds. We also establish that showing PSPACE is a subclass of nonuniform-AMPC with polynomially many rounds leads to a significant separation result in complexity theory, namely PSPACE is a proper subclass of EXP^{Σ₂^{𝖯}}.

 Brief Announcement: On Implementing Wear Leveling in Persistent Synchronization Structures   
 Authors:  Jakeb Chouinard, Kush Kansara, Xialin Liu, Nihal Potdar, and Wojciech Golab  
  Abstract    
 The last decade has witnessed an explosion of research on persistent memory, which combines the low access latency of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) with the durability of secondary storage. Intel’s implementation of persistent memory, called Optane, comes close to realizing the game-changing potential of persistent memory in terms of performance; however, it also suffers from limited endurance and relies on a proprietary wear leveling mechanism to mitigate memory cell wear-out. The traditional embedded approach to wear leveling, in which the storage device itself maps logical addresses to physical addresses, can be fast and energy-efficient, but it is also relatively inflexible and can lead to missed opportunities for optimization. An alternative school of thought, exemplified by "open channel" solid state drives (SSDs), delegates responsibility for wear leveling to software, where it can be tailored to specific applications. In this research, we consider a hypothetical hardware platform where the same paradigm is applied to the persistent memory device, and ask how the wear leveling mechanism can be co-designed with synchronization structures that generate highly skewed memory access patterns. Building on the recent work of Liu and Golab, we implement an improved wear leveling atomic counter by leveraging hardware transactional memory in a novel way. Our solution is close to optimal with respect to both space complexity and measured performance.

 Brief Announcement: Subquadratic Multivalued Asynchronous Byzantine Agreement WHP   
 Authors:  Shir Cohen and Idit Keidar  
  Abstract    
 There have been several reductions from multivalued consensus to binary consensus over the past 20 years. To the best of our knowledge, none of them solved it for Byzantine asynchronous settings. In this short paper, we close this gap. Moreover, we do so in subquadratic communication, using newly developed subquadratic binary Byzantine Agreement techniques.

 Brief Announcement: Distributed Derandomization Revisited   
 Authors:  Sameep Dahal, Francesco d'Amore, Henrik Lievonen, Timothé Picavet, and Jukka Suomela  
  Abstract    
 One of the cornerstones of the distributed complexity theory is the derandomization result by Chang, Kopelowitz, and Pettie [FOCS 2016]: any randomized LOCAL algorithm that solves a locally checkable labeling problem (LCL) can be derandomized with at most exponential overhead. The original proof assumes that the number of random bits is bounded by some function of the input size. We give a new, simple proof that does not make any such assumptions - it holds even if the randomized algorithm uses infinitely many bits. While at it, we also broaden the scope of the result so that it is directly applicable far beyond LCL problems.

 Brief Announcement: Byzantine Consensus Under Dynamic Participation with a Well-Behaved Majority   
 Authors:  Eli Gafni and Giuliano Losa  
  Abstract    
 In a permissionless system like Ethereum, participation may fluctuate dynamically as some participants unpredictably go offline and some others come back online. In such an environment, traditional Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithms may stall - even in the absence of failures - because they rely on the availability of fixed-sized quorums. The sleepy model formally captures the main requirements for solving consensus under dynamic participation, and several algorithms solve consensus with probabilistic safety in this model assuming that, at any time, more than half of the online participants are well behaved. However, whether safety can be ensured deterministically under these assumptions, especially with constant latency, remained an open question. Assuming a constant adversary, we answer in the positive by presenting a consensus algorithm that achieves deterministic safety and constant latency in expectation. In the full version of this paper, we also present a second algorithm which obtains both deterministic safety and liveness, but is likely only of theoretical interest because of its high round and message complexity. Both algorithms are striking in their simplicity.

 Brief Announcement: Scalable Agreement Protocols with Optimal Optimistic Efficiency   
 Authors:  Yuval Gelles and Ilan Komargodski  
  Abstract    
 Designing efficient distributed protocols for various agreement tasks such as Byzantine Agreement, Broadcast, and Committee Election is a fundamental problem. We are interested in scalable protocols for these tasks, where each (honest) party communicates a number of bits which is sublinear in n, the number of parties. The first major step towards this goal is due to King et al. (SODA 2006) who showed a protocol where each party sends only Õ(1) bits throughout Õ(1) rounds, but guarantees only that 1-o(1) fraction of honest parties end up agreeing on a consistent output, assuming constant < 1/3 fraction of static corruptions. Few years later, King et al. (ICDCN 2011) managed to get a full agreement protocol in the same model but where each party sends Õ(√n) bits throughout Õ(1) rounds. Getting a full agreement protocol with o(√n) communication per party has been a major challenge ever since. In light of this barrier, we propose a new framework for designing efficient agreement protocols. Specifically, we design Õ(1)-round protocols for all of the above tasks (assuming constant < 1/3 fraction of static corruptions) with optimistic and pessimistic guarantees: - Optimistic complexity: In an honest execution, all parties send only Õ(1) bits. - Pessimistic complexity: In any other case, (honest) parties send Õ(√n) bits. Thus, all an adversary can gain from deviating from the honest execution is that honest parties will need to work harder (i.e., transmit more bits) to reach agreement and terminate. Besides the above agreement tasks, we also use our new framework to get a scalable secure multiparty computation (MPC) protocol with optimistic and pessimistic complexities. Technically, we identify a relaxation of Byzantine Agreement (of independent interest) that allows us to fall-back to a pessimistic execution in a coordinated way by all parties. We implement this relaxation with Õ(1) communication bits per party and within Õ(1) rounds.

 Brief Announcement: Let It TEE: Asynchronous Byzantine Atomic Broadcast with n ≥ 2f+1   
 Authors:  Marc Leinweber and Hannes Hartenstein  
  Abstract    
 Asynchronous Byzantine Atomic Broadcast (ABAB) promises simplicity in implementation as well as increased performance and robustness in comparison to partially synchronous approaches. We adapt the recently proposed DAG-Rider approach to achieve ABAB with n ≥ 2f+1 processes, of which f are faulty, with only a constant increase in message size. We leverage a small Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) that provides a unique sequential identifier generator (USIG) to implement Reliable Broadcast with n > f processes and show that the quorum-critical proofs still hold when adapting the quorum size to ⌊ n/2 ⌋ + 1. This first USIG-based ABAB preserves the simplicity of DAG-Rider and serves as starting point for further research on TEE-based ABAB.

 Brief Announcement: Recoverable and Detectable Self-Implementations of Swap   
 Authors:  Tomer Lev Lehman, Hagit Attiya, and Danny Hendler  
  Abstract    
 Recoverable algorithms tolerate failures and recoveries of processes by using non-volatile memory. Of particular interest are self-implementations of key operations, in which a recoverable operation is implemented from its non-recoverable counterpart (in addition to reads and writes). This paper presents two self-implementations of the SWAP operation. One works in the system-wide failures model, where all processes fail and recover together, and the other in the independent failures model, where each process crashes and recovers independently of the other processes. Both algorithms are wait-free in crash-free executions, but their recovery code is blocking. We prove that this is inherent for the independent failures model. The impossibility result is proved for implementations of distinguishable operations using interfering functions, and in particular, it applies to a recoverable self-implementation of swap.

 Brief Announcement: Line Formation in Silent Programmable Matter   
 Authors:  Alfredo Navarra and Francesco Piselli  
  Abstract    
 Programmable Matter (PM) has been widely investigated in recent years. One reference model is certainly Amoebot, with its recent canonical version (DISC 2021). Along this line, with the aim of simplification and to address concurrency, the SILBOT model has been introduced (AAMAS 2020). Within SILBOT, we consider the Line formation primitive in which particles are required to end up in a configuration where they are all aligned and connected. We propose a simple and elegant distributed algorithm, optimal in terms of number of movements.

 Brief Announcement: The Space Complexity of Set Agreement Using Swap   
 Authors:  Sean Ovens  
  Abstract    
 We prove that any randomized wait-free n-process k-set agreement algorithm using only swap objects requires at least ⌈n/k⌉-1 objects. We also sketch a proof that any randomized wait-free consensus algorithm using only readable swap objects with domain size b requires at least (n-2)/(3b+1) objects.

 Brief Announcement: Grassroots Distributed Systems: Concept, Examples, Implementation and Applications   
 Authors:  Ehud Shapiro  
  Abstract    
 Informally, a distributed system is grassroots if it is permissionless and can have autonomous, independently-deployed instances - geographically and over time - that may interoperate voluntarily once interconnected. More formally, in a grassroots system the set of all correct behaviors of a set of agents P is strictly included in the set of the correct behaviors of P when they are embedded within a larger set of agents P' ⊃ P. Grassroots systems are potentially important as they may allow communities to conduct their social, economic, civic, and political lives in the digital realm solely using their members' networked computing devices (e.g., smartphones), free of third-party control, surveillance, manipulation, coercion, or rent seeking (e.g., by global digital platforms such as Facebook or Bitcoin). Client-server/cloud computing systems are not grassroots, and neither are systems designed to have a single global instance (Bitcoin/Ethereum with hardwired seed miners/bootnodes), and systems that rely on a single global data structure (IPFS, DHTs). An example grassroots system would be a serverless smartphone-based social network supporting multiple independently-budding communities that can merge when a member of one community becomes also a member of another. Here, we formalize the notion of grassroots distributed systems; describe a grassroots dissemination protocol for the model of asynchrony and argue its safety, liveness, and being grassroots; extend the implementation to mobile (address-changing) devices that communicate via an unreliable network (e.g. smartphones using UDP); and discuss how grassroots dissemination can realize grassroots social networking and grassroots cryptocurrencies. The mathematical construction employs distributed multiagent transition systems to define the notions of grassroots protocols, to specify the grassroots dissemination protocols, and to prove their correctness. The protocols use the blocklace - a distributed, partially-ordered counterpart of the replicated, totally-ordered blockchain.

 Welcome to the main web site of The International Symposium on DIStributed Computing (DISC)   .  
 DISC is an international symposium on the theory, design, analysis, implementation and application of distributed systems and networks. DISC is organized in cooperation with the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS)   .  
 The symposium was established in 1985 as a biannual International Workshop on Distributed Algorithms on Graphs (WDAG). The scope was soon extended to cover all aspects of distributed algorithms as WDAG came to stand for International Workshop on Distributed AlGorithms, and in 1989 it became an annual symposium. To reflect the expansion of its area of interest, the name was changed to DISC (International Symposium on DIStributed Computing) in 1998. The name change also reflects the opening of the symposium to all aspects of distributed computing. The aim of DISC is to reflect the exciting and rapid developments in this field.  
 This site was created for archiving information about all WDAGs and DISCs, organized since 1985.  
 DISC 2024  will be held in Madrid, Spain on October 28 – November 1, 2024.

 Developing Efficient Scientific Gateways for Supercomputer Environments Supported by Deep Learning Models  
 Speaker  : Prof. Carla Osthoff (LNCC)  
 The scientific gateway BioinfoPortal for bioinformatics applications is hosted in the National Laboratory for Scientific Computing (LNCC) and is coupled to the Santos Dumont (SDumont) supercomputer environment. BioinfoPortal offers a catalog of bioinformatics computational software that benefits from the parallel and distributed architecture offered by LNCC. Task submissions consume SDumont nodes shared by other supercomputer users; then, it is required to set the best configuration, defined by the best choice of the number of threads/nodes, to be allocated for every task submission. This talk presents research analysis using Deep Neural Networks to estimate the computational time required to execute bioinformatics software in several scenarios using a pre-configured number of nodes and threads. We aim to demonstrate the computational behavior of software in Bioinfoportal and which computational scenario can be chosen to execute software in SDumont efficiently. Results support that the neural networks can predict the most representative variable and identify the configuration with the lowest computational time. This way, BioinforPortal consuming time can lead to an efficient and green gateway, increasing Santos Dumont Supercomputing execution job throughput and decreasing job execution queue waiting time.

 Authors  : Vinicius Garcia Pinto (UFRGS), Lucas Nesi (UFRGS), Lucas Mello Schnorr (UFRGS)  
 Room 502   
 Plataformas computacionais para processamento de alto desempenho usualmente são compartilhadas por usuários com demandas variadas. Com frequência aplicações legadas ou aquelas que possuem requisitos e dependências muito específicas sobrecarregam os administradores do sistema ou simplesmente tem sua execução inviabilizada. Uma solução passa a ser configurar, compilar e instalar a aplicação e as respectivas dependências inteiramente em espaço de usuário. Entretanto, tal tarefa é custosa e propensa a erros, o que motiva a adoção de soluções automatizadas. Neste minicurso, propomos a apresentação de duas soluções que permitem a instalação de pacotes inteiramente em espaço de usuário de maneira reprodutível e compartilhável.

 Panelists  : Profa. Lucia Drummond (UFF), Prof. Antônio Tadeu Azevedo Gomes (LNCC), Profa. Mariza Ferro (UFF), Dr. Fabio Alves de Oliveira (NVidia)  
 Moderator  : Profa. Flavia Bernardini (UFF)  
 Machine Learning (ML) area have evolved in the last years due to the development of High Performance Computing (HPC). On the other hand, we also have seen many works for evolving HPC through ML. In this context, we could ask: If the community needs HPC to make huge ML-based models more effective, but this same community also needs ML to empower HPC, which area starts this run? Are they exclusive or can we consider both initiatives? This panel aims to discuss this chicken-egg dilemma.

 Benchmarking of Hybrid Computational Continuum   
 Speaker  : Ivona Brandic  
 Chair  : César De Rose  
 Real life applications can be executed on devices that range in size from smartphones to warehouse size data centers. Meanwhile, architectures are becoming heterogeneous including various accelerators and even non von Neumann computers into the computational continuum. In this talk we discuss challenges when benchmarking different types of applications on a hybrid computational continuum. First, we present the methods for decomposition and execution of HPC applications on hybrid Classic/Quantum systems. Second, we discuss the benefits but also problems and challenges when executing applications of hybrid systems. Third, we revisit the current state of the art testbeds for the execution and benchmarking of hybrid classic/quantum.

 Frontier: The World’s Most Powerful Computer for Science   
 Speaker  : Bronson Messer  
 Chair  : Tiago Ferreto  
 The first exascale computer, called Frontier, has been delivered to Oak Ridge National Laboratory this past year. This unique scientific instrument is the culmination of more than a decade of concerted effort. I will relate a bit of the history of hybrid-node computing at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) and how Frontier represents the latest iteration of that approach. Some details of Frontier’s architecture will be discussed, including an overview of the new AMD GPUs that provide the bulk of the computational power for Frontier. Finally, we will take a look at some problems that will benefit from the increased capability at exascale and I will convey some lesson learned from trying to get the applications attacking these problems running on this machine.

 Pairwise, Structural and Multiple Biological Sequence Comparison in HPC Platforms: the Quest for the Optimal Solution   
 Speaker  : Alba Cristina Magalhaes Alves de Melo  
 Chair  : Arthur Lorenzon  
 Biological sequence comparison is an important problem in Bioinformatics and its goal is to define how similar the sequences are, producing a score, and highlighting their similarities, producing an alignment. There are many ways to compare biological sequences and all of them require high performance computing solutions, when the optimal solution is needed. In this talk, we will deal with three types of sequence comparison. First, we discuss pairwise sequence comparison, which is often solved with dynamic programming using variants of the Smith-Waterman algorithm, producing the optimal solution with time complexity O(n^2), where n is the length of the sequences. We present our MASA tools, which can be used in CPU or GPU to pairwise compare long DNA sequences. The last version of MASA for GPUs (MASA-CUDAlign-MultiBP) attained the best performance in the literature in 2021. Then, we examine the structural RNA alignment problem, that is also solved with dynamic programming, using the Sankoff algorithm, with time complexity O(n^6). We present our CUDA-Sankoff tool and show that it has very good speedups. Next, we discuss the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) problem, which is proven NP-Complete. We present our PA-Star CPU-based tool, which executes a variant of the A-Star algorithm to compute the optimal MSA. We show that PA-Star is able to compare multiple sequences in reduced time, when compared to the literature. At the end of the talk, we will do a covid-19 case study, showing how our three tools are used to compare SARS-CoV-2 sequences.

 David C. Shepherd: Empirical Research (Can) Lead to Industrial Impact; Learning from Experience   

 “The Pasteur’s quadrant approach implies that it is possible to couple, simultaneously, the development of fundamental science to the solution of problems important to society." -Donald Stokes  
  
  Too often software engineering research lives in an alternate, academic world, completely divorced from the reality of industrial practice. The ESEM community, pioneered by researchers like Victor Basili and strengthened by countless researchers, aims to destroy this false dichotomy. Through case studies, qualitative studies, and academia-industry collaborations this field seeks to learn about and influence industrial practice. In this talk I will detail my experience with industrial-facing research, with an eye towards techniques that were fruitful, as well as approaches that fell short. By sharing my experiences, from my success working with ABB Robotics to my frustrations when releasing open source software development tools, my hope is that the ESEM community can be better equipped in their goal of studying and influencing the software engineering industry.

 *THE SYMPOSIUM*   

 The 2023 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications (DS-RT 2023) promises to be a grand affair and will take place in Singapore. DS-RT 2023 serves as a platform for simulationists from academia, industry and research labs to present recent research results in Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications.   
   
 DS-RT 2023 targets the growing overlap between large distributed simulations and real time applications, such as metaverse, collaborative virtual environments, pervasive and ubiquitous application scenarios, actuator systems and the usage of artificial intelligence techniques in both simulation and real-time applications.   
   
 The conference features prominent invited speakers as well as papers by top researchers in the field. DS-RT 2023 will include contributed technical papers, invited papers, and tutorials. The proceedings will be published by IEEE-CS press.   
    
 *CALL FOR PAPERS*   
  DS-RT provides an international forum for the discussion and presentation of original ideas, recent results and achievements by researchers, research students, and systems developers on issues and challenges related to distributed simulation and real time applications. Authors are encouraged to submit both theoretical and practical results of significance. Demonstration of new tools/applications is very encouraged.   
   
 The scope of the symposium includes, but is not limited to:   
  
 * Paradigms, Methodology and Software Architectures for Large Scale Distributed and Real-Time Simulations (e.g. Parallel and Distributed Simulation, Multi-Agent Based Distributed Simulation, HLA/RTI, Web, Grid and cloud based Simulation, hardware-software co-design for extreme scale simulations)   
 * Paradigms, Modelling, Architecture and Environments for Large Scale Real-time Systems and Concurrent Systems with hard and soft Real-Time Constraints

 ESEM  
 ESEM, the International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement, is the premier empirical software engineering and measurement conference.  
 The objective of the International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM) is to provide a forum where researchers, practitioners, and educators can report and discuss the most recent research results, innovations, trends, experiences, and concerns in the field of empirical software engineering and metrics.  
 ESEM conference encourages the exchange of ideas that help explore, understand, and model phenomena in software engineering from an empirical viewpoint. The conference focuses on the processes, design and structure of empirical studies, and the results of specific studies. Studies may vary from controlled experiments to field studies and from quantitative to qualitative studies.  
 ESEM committees care about fundamental ethical values related to diversity, as gender, ethnicity, disability, religion, and similar personal traits. Diversity will be sought at different levels, remarkably including conference committees' composition.  
 ESEM conference organizers will set as highest priority to provide a welcoming, respectful and positive atmosphere to all attendees. Aggressive or offensive language will not be allowed in talks, questions or answers. Aggressive or offensive behaviour, including any type of harassing, will not be allowed in the event, being a justified reason for expulsion without any compensation.  
 All ESEM conference committees as well as authors are obliged to follow and apply Ethical Guidelines as available at ACM  and IEEE  .  
 On this web site you can find information about the ESEM conference series as well as useful information for organizing a future ESEM conference.

 25th INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON FORMAL METHODS  
  
 The 25th International Symposium on Formal Methods will be held at the University of Lübeck  .  
 Main conference: March, 7th – 9th, 2023  
  Workshops, Tutorial, etc. March 6th, 10th 2023   
 FM 2023 is the 25th international symposium in a series organized by Formal Methods Europe (FME)  . The topics covered include the development and application of formal methods in a wide range of domains including software, cyber-physical systems and integrated computer-based systems.  
 Vision for the Event  
 Covid-19 forced the world to go digital, including conferences. But, restating the guiding theme of FM in 2015, a conference is a social event at which participants should have the opportunity to interact, get updated on recent and on-going research, and foster interesting new ideas and collaborations. We have learned that such an interaction can hardly be realized in digital meetings. However, we are fairly confident that in spring 2023, the Covid-19 situation will be under control and will allow for physical scientific meetings again. So our guiding thesis for FM’23 is  
 Let’s have  real conferences again!    
 Topic-wise, we are well aware of the huge interest in AI and machine learning-based software development.  
  For safety critical systems, such systems have to be formally analyzed and verified. In other words,  
 S olid AI-based systems need Formal Methods!    
 While traditional formal methods will be the main topic of FM’23, we will add Formal Methods for AI as a major  
  theme for the next edition of FM.

 FM: The Formal Methods Symposia  

 The Formal Methods Symposia  
 FME organizes a symposium roughly every 18 months. Each symposium attracts between 125 and 500 attendees, interested in both theoretical aspects of formal methods as well as the practical application of formal methods, from all over the world.  
 Partnership with Journals  
 FME has established partnerships with several prestigious formal methods journals. Through these partnerships, the FM symposia will include presentations of papers published in the journals in the program of the FM symposia. These presentations compose a Journal-First Track  . A dedicated Track Chair, with the help of a small committee, selects papers from the partnership journals and invite authors to present their work at FM. In this way, FME aims to strenghten the social side of our science, as lively discussion are central to scientific progress.  
 The partner journals that support the Journal-first track are:  
 Formal Aspects of Computing | (ACM) 
  Formal Methods in System Design | (Springer) 
  Science of Computer programming | (Elsevier) 
  Proceedings  
 Proceedings of the FME symposia are published by Springer Verlag as part of the LNCS (Lecture Notes in Computer Science)  series. DBLP maintains an index of all FME symposia  .  
 FME Subgroup  
 FME has a subgroup dealing with daily matters concerning the symposia and thinking about strategic issues in the longer run.

 Cliff B. Jones: Understanding Programming Languages   
 Springer, November 2020, 229 pp, ISBN: 978-3-030-59256-1. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59257-8   
 Summary  
 The book Understanding Programming Languages  by Cliff B. Jones is about the formal specification of the semantics of programming languages. It focuses on the structural operational semantics of imperative and sequential languages, including features such as blocks and procedures, with an extension to concurrent objects at the end of the book. The material is presented with great clarity and requires almost no background knowledge, making the book perfectly suitable for any person curious about programming languages and seeking a deeper understanding of how they work. This book is also for language designers, as being formally precise is an invaluable tool to help catch design issues early in the design phase.

  ============================================================  
  Call For Papers  
  FLOPS 2024: 17th International Symposium on Functional and Logic Programming  
  ============================================================  
   
  May 15-17, 2024, Kumamoto, Japan  
  https://conf.researchr.org/home/flops-2024   

  FLOPS aims to bring together practitioners, researchers and implementers  
  of declarative programming, to discuss mutually interesting results and  
  common problems: theoretical advances, their implementations in language  
  systems and tools, and applications of these systems in practice. The  
  scope includes all aspects of the design, semantics, theory,  
  applications, implementations, and teaching of declarative programming.  
  FLOPS specifically aims to promote cross-fertilization between theory  
  and practice and among different styles of declarative programming.  
   
  Previous FLOPS meetings were held at Fuji Susono (1995), Shonan Village  
  (1996), Kyoto (1998), Tsukuba (1999), Tokyo (2001), Aizu (2002), Nara  
  (2004), Fuji Susono (2006), Ise (2008), Sendai (2010), Kobe (2012),  
  Kanazawa (2014), Kochi (2016), Nagoya (2018), Akita (2020, online), and  
  Kyoto (2022, online).  

  *** Scope ***  
   
  FLOPS solicits original papers in all areas of declarative programming:  
   
  * functional, logic, functional-logic programming, rewriting systems,  
  formal methods and model checking, program transformations and program  
  refinements, developing programs with the help of theorem provers or  
  SAT/SMT solvers, verifying properties of programs using declarative  
  programming techniques;  
   
  * foundations, language design, implementation issues (compilation  
  techniques, memory management, run-time systems, etc.), applications and  
  case studies.  
   
  FLOPS promotes cross-fertilization among different styles of declarative  
  programming. Therefore, research papers must be written to be  
  understandable by a wide audience of declarative programmers and  
  researchers. In particular, each submission should explain its  
  contributions in both general and technical terms, clearly identifying  
  what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant for its  
  area, and comparing it with previous work. Submission of system  
  descriptions and declarative pearls are especially encouraged.  

  *** Submission ***  
   
  Submissions should fall into one of the following categories:  
   
  * Regular research papers: they should describe new results and will be  
  judged on originality, correctness, and significance.  
   
  * System descriptions: they should describe a working system and will be  
  judged on originality, usefulness, and design.  
   
  * Declarative pearls: new and excellent declarative programs or theories  
  with illustrative applications.  
   
  System descriptions and declarative pearls must be explicitly marked as  
  such in the title. Submissions must be unpublished and not submitted for  
  publication elsewhere. Work that already appeared in unpublished or  
  informally published workshops proceedings may be submitted. Submissions  
  must be written in English and can be up to 15 pages excluding  
  references, though system descriptions and pearls are typically shorter.  
  The formatting has to conform to Springer’s LNCS guidelines. FLOPS 2024  
  will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process.  
   
  For more details, see  
   
  https://conf.researchr.org/home/flops-2024   
   
  Papers should be submitted electronically at  
   
  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=flops2024   

  *** Publication ***  
   
  The proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS series. We  
  expect to invite the authors of a selection of the best papers to submit  
  an extended version of their FLOPS paper to a special issue which will  
  appear in the journal Science of Computer Programming.  

  *** Important Dates ***  
   
  All deadlines are Anywhere on Earth (AoE = UTC-12).  
   
  * Abstract due: Wed 6th Dec 2023  
  * Submission deadline: Wed 13th Dec 2023  
  * Notifications: Wed 31st Jan 2024  
  * Final versions due: Wed 28th Feb 2024

 Lübeck, Germany, 6-10 March 2023  
   
  FM 2023 is the 25th international symposium in a series organized by Formal Methods Europe (FME), an independent association whose aim is to stimulate the use of, and research on, formal methods for software development. FME has a Memorandum of Understanding with the ERCIM Working Group on Formal Methods for Industrial Critical Systems (FMICS) to collaborate in holding an annual joint industry-focussed event. This Industry Day (I-Day) at FM targets the industrial development and use of formal methods.  
 Topics   
  FM 2023 will highlight the development and application of formal methods in a wide range of domains including trustworthy AI, software, computer-based systems, systems-of-systems, cyber-physical systems, security, human-computer interaction, manufacturing, sustainability, energy, transport, smart cities, healthcare, and biology. It particularly welcomes papers on techniques, tools and experiences in interdisciplinary settings. It also welcomes papers on experiences of applying formal methods in industrial settings, and on the design and validation of formal method tools.  
 New this year! FM 2023 explicitly welcomes submissions to the special FM 2023 session on “Formal methods meets AI”, which is focused on formal and rigorous modelling and analysis techniques to ensuring safety, robustness etc. (trustworthiness) of AI-based systems.  
 Deadlines   
  The paper submission deadline is 11 September 2022, with an abstract due one week earlier. Accepted papers will be included in the Symposium Proceedings published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Extended versions of selected papers will be invited for publication in a special issue of a journal.

 Celebrating its 20th anniversary, the International Symposium on Grids & Clouds (ISGC) 2023 will be held on 19~24 March 2023 at Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan. The HEPiX 2023 Spring Workshop   then will take place back-to-back on 27~31 March. The ISGC is one of the most important annual international events in Asia that brings together scientists and engineers worldwide to exchange ideas, to present on challenges, solutions and future development issues in the field of Open Data and Open Science.    
 The main theme of ISGC 2023 will focus on “accelerating time-to-science through computing”. Over the past two decades, the scientific research had been revolutionized by the infrastructure of distributed computing and the concept of open data. Compute-intensive research has once been a barrier for many researchers. Nowadays, the cloud and distributed computing infrastructure could provide researchers immediate access to an unlimited amount of computing power and allows them to ask questions that may not have been possible. Moreover, the virtual infrastructure allows researchers to share large-scale data. Reducing time to science is something every researcher wish to experience.    
 Promoting the open data/open science collaboration between Asia Pacific region and the world, the Symposium offers an excellent opportunity to learn from the latest achievement from Europe, America and Asia. The goal of ISGC is to create a face-to-face venue where individual communities and national representatives can present and share their contributions to the solutions of global challenges. We cordially invite and welcome your participation!

 International Symposium on Grids & Clouds 2022    
 ISGC2022  21 - 25 March, 2022  online, Academia Sinica Computing Centre (ASGC), Taipei, Taiwan, Website: https://indico4.twgrid.org/event/20/    
 The annual ISGC virtual conference will be held from 21 to 25 March of 2022. While the research data are becoming a real asset nowadays, it is an information and knowledge gained through thorough analysis that makes them so valuable. To process vast amounts of data collected, novel high performance data analytics methods and tools are needed, combining classical simulation oriented approaches, big data processing and advanced AI methods. Such a combination is not straightforward and needs novel insights at all levels of the computing environment – from the network and hardware fabrics through the operating systems and middleware to the platforms and software, not forgetting the security – to support data oriented research. Challenging use cases that apply difficult scientific problems are necessary to properly drive the evolution and also to validate such high performance data analytics environments.

 International Symposium on Grids & Clouds 2019    
 ISGC2019  31st March - 5th April 2019  Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan    
 The International Symposium on Grids and Clouds (ISGC) 2019 & Soundscape Conference will be held at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan from 31 March ~ 5 April 2019, with co-located events and workshops. The main theme of ISGC 2019 is “Efficient and safe processing of FAIR Open Data”.  
  
 To achieve the full potential of Open Data and Open Science, scientists should be able to focus on their area of interest and be shielded from the internal complexity of e-infrastructures and the needs to manually deal with the different data formats, input and output constraints of used tools, the authentication and access control and any other technical or technological obstacles that are still part of the current data processing and analysis environments. This is emphasized by the FAIR concept -- data must be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable. New approaches are emerging, hiding the complexity of the underlying computing and data fabrics, exposing just integrated views through scientific portals and gateways, notebooks and other virtual computing environments that promise to enhance the efficiency of work with advanced and complex contemporary e-infrastructures. On the other hand, possible privacy issues related to the Data collected and new, easy-to-deploy analysis methods like those applying deep neural networks, remind us of the need for proper security tools and environments and create new challenges for dealing with private and sensitive data and derived information.  

 International Symposium on Grids and Clouds 2018 in conjunction with Frontiers in Computational Drug Discovery    
 ISGC 2018 & FCDD  16 - 23 March 2018  Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan    
 The International Symposium on Grids and Clouds (ISGC) 2018 in conjunction with Frontiers in Computational Drug Discovery (FCDD) will be held at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan from 16-23 March 2018, with co-located events and workshops. The main theme of ISGC 2018 is “Understanding Open Data: Challenges and Opportunities in the Deep Learning Era”.  
  
 The global move towards an Open science and its Open data policy is bringing its first results in opening access to fast growing base of scientific data. This leads to a new set of challenges for the e-infrastructures expected to be the Open Science foundations. They must deal with new demands in traditional areas of their expertise: increase storage and computing capacity, simultaneous access to different pools and warehouses of scientific data, strong access control for sensitive data and many other things at scale levels of magnitude higher than before.  
  
 On top of that, increased amount of accessible Open data brings also new challenges, most notably how to understand and interpret the fast growing base of available scientific data. Machine learning and specifically deep learning techniques are currently the most promising general answers to this challenge. However, to deploy these techniques at scale of global e-infrastructures is a highly challenging task, pushing forwards the limits of technology, management and operation.  
  
 The goal of ISGC 2018 in conjunction with Frontiers in Computational Drug Discovery (FCDD) is to create a face-to-face venue where individual communities and national representatives can present and share their contributions to the global puzzle and contribute thus to the solution of global challenges.  

 International Symposium on Grids and Clouds (ISGC) 2017    
 ISGC2017  5 - 10 March, 2017  Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan    
 The International Symposium on Grids and Clouds (ISGC) 2017 will be held at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan from 5-10 March 2017, with co-located events and workshops. The main theme of ISGC 2017 is “Global Challenges: From Open Data to Open Science”.  
 The unprecedented progress in ICT has transformed the way education is conducted and research is carried out. The emerging global e-Infrastructure, championed by global science communities such as High Energy Physics, Astronomy, and Bio-medicine, must permeate into other sciences. Many areas, such as climate change, disaster mitigation, and human sustainability and well-being, represent global challenges where collaboration over e-Infrastructure will presumably help resolve the common problems of the people who are impacted. Access to global e-Infrastructure helps also the less globally organized, long-tail sciences, with their own collaboration challenges.  
 Open data are not only a political phenomenon serving government transparency; they also create an opportunity to eliminate access barriers to all scientific data, specifically data from global sciences and regional data that concern natural phenomena and people. In this regard, the purpose of open data is to improve sciences, accelerating specifically those that may benefit people. Nevertheless, to eliminate barriers to open data is itself a daunting task and the barriers to individuals, institutions and big collaborations are manifold.  
 Open science is a step beyond open data, where the tools and understanding of scientific data must be made available to whoever is interested to participate in such scientific research. The promotion of open science may change the academic tradition practiced over the past few hundred years. This change of dynamics may contribute to the resolution of common challenges of human sustainability where the current pace of scientific progress is not sufficiently fast.  
 ISGC 2017 created a face-to-face venue where individual communities and national representatives can present and share their contributions to the global puzzle and contribute thus to the solution of global challenges.  

 International Symposium on Grids and Clouds (ISGC) 2016    
 ISGC 2016  13-18 March 2016  Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan    
 The International Symposium on Grids and Clouds (ISGC) 2016 will be held at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan from 13-18 March 2016, with co-located events and workshops. The conference is hosted by the Academia Sinica Grid Computing Centre (ASGC).  
 The theme of ISGC 2016 focuses on“Ubiquitous e-infrastructures and Applications”. Contemporary research is impossible without a strong IT component – researchers rely on the existence of stable and widely available e-infrastructures and their higher level functions and properties. As a result of these expectations, e-Infrastructures are becoming ubiquitous, providing an environment that supports large scale collaborations that deal with global challenges as well as smaller and temporal research communities focusing on particular scientific problems. To support those diversified communities and their needs, the e-Infrastructures themselves are becoming more layered and multifaceted, supporting larger groups of applications.  
 Following the call for the last year conference, ISGC 2016 continues its aim to bring together users and application developers with those responsible for the development and operation of multi-purpose ubiquitous e-Infrastructures. Topics of discussion include Physics (including HEP) and Engineering Applications, Biomedicine & Life Sciences Applications, Earth & Environmental Sciences & Biodiversity Applications, Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) Applications, Virtual Research Environment (including Middleware, tools, services, workflow, etc.), Data Management, Big Data, Networking & Security, Infrastructure & Operations, Infrastructure Clouds and Virtualisation, Interoperability, Business Models & Sustainability, Highly Distributed Computing Systems, and High Performance & Technical Computing (HPTC), etc.

 The International Symposium on Grids and Clouds (ISGC) 2015 is held at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan from 15-20 March 2015, with co-located events and workshops. The conference is hosted by the Academia Sinica Grid Computing Centre (ASGC). “Global e-Infrastructure for Global Challenges” is the theme of ISGC 2015.Nowadays, the world is facing complex and global challenges in climate, health, energy, safety that impact whole populations and that are not restricted by country borders. Being of continental or even transcontinental size, these challenges can be tackled only through collaboration between multiple user communities, crossing nations and regions. Such collaborations are complicated by fragmented research, where individual groups and nations merely solve isolated pieces of the global puzzle. While not a panacea, the global e-Infrastructure supporting international collaboration helps us work on the puzzle effectively, accessibly, and completely. The universality of the global e-Infrastructure concept must find its way into its proper implementation, resulting from close interaction and collaboration with communities that use it. ISGC 2015 solicits papers and contributions that show this interaction benefitting both sides – the global communities dealing with global challenges (and the pieces of the global puzzle) and the e-Infrastructure developers and managers who face new challenges of size and multiplicity of requirements. Topics of discussion include Physics (including HEP) and Engineering Applications, Biomedicine & Life Sciences Applications, Earth & Environmental Sciences & Biodiversity Applications, Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) Application, Virtual Research Environment (including Middleware, tools, services, workflow, etc.), Data Management, Big Data, Infrastructure & Operations Management, Infrastructure Clouds and Virtualisation, Interoperability, Business Models & Sustainability, Highly Distributed Computing Systems, and High Performance & Technical Computing (HPTC).

 The International Symposium on Grids and Clouds (ISGC) 2014 will be held at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan from 23-28 March 2014, with co-located events and workshops. The conference is hosted by the Academia Sinica Grid Computing Centre (ASGC).“Bringing the data scientist to global e-Infrastructures” is the theme of ISGC 2014. The last decade has seen the phenomenal growth in the production of data in all forms by all research communities to produce a deluge of data from which information and knowledge need to be extracted. Key to this success will be the data scientist – educated to use advanced algorithms, applications and infrastructures – collaborating internationally to tackle society’s challenges. ISGC 2014 will bring together researchers working in all aspects of data science from different disciplines around the world to collaborate and educate themselves in the latest achievements and techniques being used to tackle the data deluge. In addition to the regular workshops, technical presentations and plenary keynotes, ISGC this year will focus on how to grow the data science community by considering the educational foundation needed for tomorrow’s data scientist. Topics of discussion include Physics (including HEP) and Engineering Applications, Biomedicine & Life Sciences Applications, Earth & Environmental Sciences & Biodiversity Applications, Humanities & Social Sciences Application, Virtual Research Environment (including Middleware, tools, services, workflow, ... etc.), Data Management, Big Data, Infrastructure & Operations Management, Infrastructure Clouds and Virtualisation, Interoperability, Business Models & Sustainability, Highly Distributed Computing Systems, and High Performance & Technical Computing (HPTC).   

 The International Symposium on Grids and Clouds (ISGC) 2013    
 ISGC 2013  17 - 22 March 2013  Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan    
 The International Symposium on Grids and Clouds (ISGC) 2013 will be held at Academia Sinica in Taipei from 17-22 March 2013, with co-located events and workshops. The conference is hosted by the Academia Sinica Grid Computing Centre (ASGC). For more than a decade, ISGC has been tracking the advances in distributed computing across the Asia Pacific region and leading the development of regional e-Science activities and collaborations around the world. With the continuous support and dedication from the delegates, ISGC has provided the primary international distributed computing platform where distinguished researchers and collaboration partners from around the world share their knowledge and experiences. The theme of ISGC 2013 is Collaborative Simulation, Modelling and Data Analytics in Grids and Clouds. The global e-science movement is bringing with it fundamental changes in the way we produce, manage, understand and exploit data within worldwide collaborations. At its heart is the complex large-scale data analytics that takes place around the large data sets generated from simulations, modelling and physical instruments. ISGC 2013 will bring together from the Asia-Pacific region and around the world, researchers that are developing applications to produce these large-scale data sets and the data analytics tools to extract the knowledge from the generated data, and the e-infrastructure providers that integrate the distributed computing, storage and network resources to support these multidisciplinary research collaborations. The meeting will feature workshops, tutorials, keynotes and technical sessions to further support the development of a global e-infrastructure for collaborative Simulation, Modelling and Data Analytics. Topics of discussion include Physics (including HEP) and Engineering Applications, Biomedicine & Life Sciences Applications, Earth & Environmental Science & Biodiversity, Humanities & Social Sciences Applications, Infrastructure & Operations Management, Middleware & Interoperability, Infrastructure Clouds & Virtualisation, Business Models & Sustainability, Data Management, Managing Distributed Computing Systems, High Performance & Technical Computing (HPTC), and Big Data Analytics.   

 The International Symposium on Grids and Clouds (ISGC) 2012    
 ISGC 2012  26 February- 2 March  Taipei, Taiwan    
 The International Symposium on Grids and Clouds (ISGC) 2012 will be held at Academia Sinica in Taipei from 26 February to 2 March 2012, with co-located events and workshops. The conference is hosted by the Academia Sinica Grid Computing Centre (ASGC). 2012 is the decennium anniversary of the ISGC which over the last decade has tracked the convergence, collaboration and innovation of individual researchers across the Asia Pacific region to a coherent community. With the continuous support and dedication from the delegates, ISGC has provided the primary international distributed computing platform where distinguished researchers and collaboration partners from around the world share their knowledge and experiences. The last decade has seen the wide-scale emergence of e-Infrastructure as a critical asset for the modern e-Scientist. The emergence of large-scale research infrastructures and instruments that has produced a torrent of electronic data is forcing a generational change in the scientific process and the mechanisms used to analyse the resulting data deluge. No longer can the processing of these vast amounts of data and production of relevant scientific results be undertaken by a single scientist. Virtual Research Communities that span organisations around the world, through an integrated digital infrastructure that connects the trust and administrative domains of multiple resource providers, have become critical in supporting these analyses. Topics covered in ISGC 2012 include: High Energy Physics, Biomedicine & Life Sciences, Earth Science, Environmental Changes and Natural Disaster Mitigation, Humanities & Social Sciences, Operations & Management, Middleware & Interoperability, Security and Networking, Infrastructure Clouds & Virtualisation, Business Models & Sustainability, Data Management, Distributed Volunteer & Desktop Grid Computing, High Throughput Computing, and High Performance, Manycore & GPU Computing.   

 The International Symposium on Grids and Clouds and the Open Grid Forum    
 ISGC 2011 & OGF 31  March 19 - 25, 2011  Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan    
 The International Symposium on Grids and Clouds 2011 1  was held at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan on 19th to 25th March 2011. A series of workshops and tutorials preceded the symposium. The aim of ISGC is to promote the use of grid and cloud computing in the Asia Pacific region. Over the 9 years that ISGC has been running, the programme has evolved to become more user community focused with subjects reaching out to a larger population. Research communities are making widespread use of distributed computing facilities. Linking together data centers, production grids, desktop systems or public clouds, many researchers are able to do more research and produce results more quickly. They could do much more if the computing infrastructures they use worked together more effectively. Changes in the way we approach distributed computing, and new services from commercial providers, mean that boundaries are starting to blur. This opens the way for hybrid solutions that make it easier for researchers to get their job done. Consequently the theme for ISGC2011 was the opportunities that better integrated computing infrastructures can bring, and the steps needed to achieve the vision of a seamless global research infrastructure.  
 2011 is a year of firsts for ISGC. First the title - while the acronym remains the same, its meaning has changed to reflect the evolution of computing: The International Symposium on Grids and Clouds. Secondly the programming - ISGC 2011 has always included topical workshops and tutorials. But 2011 is the first year that ISGC has been held in conjunction with the Open Grid Forum 2  which held its 31st meeting with a series of working group sessions. The ISGC plenary session included keynote speakers from OGF that highlighted the relevance of standards for the research community. ISGC with its focus on applications and operational aspects complemented well with OGF’s focus on standards development. ISGC brought to OGF real-life use cases and needs to be addressed while OGF exposed the state of current developments and issues to be resolved if commonalities are to be exploited.  
 Another first is for the Proceedings – for 2011, an open access online publishing scheme will ensure these Proceedings will appear more quickly and more people will have access to the results, providing a long-term online archive of the event.  
 The symposium attracted more than 212 participants from 29 countries spanning Asia, Europe and the Americas. Coming so soon after the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the participation of our Japanese colleagues was particularly appreciated. Keynotes by invited speakers highlighted the impact of distributed computing infrastructures in the social sciences and humanities, high energy physics, earth and life sciences. Plenary sessions entitled Grid Activities in Asia Pacific surveyed the state of grid deployment across 11 Asian countries.  
 Through the parallel sessions, the impact of distributed computing infrastructures in a range of research disciplines was highlighted. Operational procedures, middleware and security aspects were addressed in a dedicated sessions.  
 The symposium was covered online in real-time by the GridCast team from the GridTalk project. A running blog including summarises of specific sessions as well as video interviews with keynote speakers and personalities and photos.  
 As with all regions of the world, grid and cloud computing has to be prove it is adding value to researchers if it is be accepted by them and demonstrate its impact on society as a while if it to be supported by national governments, funding agencies and the general public. ISGC has helped foster the emergence of a strong regional interest in the earth and life sciences, notably for natural disaster mitigation and bioinformatics studies.  
 Prof. Simon C. Lin organised an intense social programme with a gastronomic tour of Taipei culminating with a banquet for all the symposium’s participants at the hotel Palais de Chine.  
 I would like to thank all the members of the programme committee, the participants and above all our hosts, Prof. Simon C. Lin and his excellent support team at Academia Sinica.

  Theme: Accelerating time-to-science through computing     
 Celebrating its 20th anniversary, the International Symposium on Grid Computing (ISGC) 2023 will be held on March 19-24, 2023 at Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan. The ISGC is one of the most important annual international events in Asia that brings together scientists and engineers worldwide to exchange ideas, to present on challenges, solutions and future development issues in the field of Open Data and Open Science.  
   
  The main theme of ISGC 2023 will focus on “accelerating time-to-science through computing”  . Over the past two decades, the infrastructure of distributed computing and the concept of open data has revolutionized the scientific research. Compute-intensive research has once been a barrier for many researchers. Nowadays, the cloud and distributed computing infrastructure could provide researchers immediate access to an unlimited amount of computing power, and they can ask questions that may not have been possible. Moreover, the virtual infrastructure allows scientists to share large-scale data. Reducing time to science is something every researcher wish to experience.  
   
  Promoting the open data/open science collaboration between Asia Pacific region and the world, the Symposium offers an excellent opportunity to learn from the latest achievement from Europe, America and Asia. The goal of ISGC is to create a face-to-face venue where individual communities and national representatives can present and share their contributions to the solutions of global challenges. We cordially invite and welcome your participation!  
   
  Topics of Interest  :   
   
  1. Applications and results from the Virtual Research Communities and Industry   
   
  (1) Physics and Engineering Applications   
  Submissions should report on experience with physics and engineering applications including high energy physics that exploit grid and cloud computing services, applications that are planned or under development, or application tools and methodologies. Topics of interest include: (1)Data analysis and application including ML/DL based one; (2) Management of distributed data; (3) Performance analysis and system tuning; (4) Workload scheduling; (5) Management of an experimental collaboration as a virtual organization, in particular learning from the Covid19 pandemic; (6) Expectations for the evolution of computing models drawn from recent experience handling extremely large and geographically diverse datasets, and (7) Expectations for the evolution of computing operation etc. towards the carbon neutral.  
   
  (2) Health & Life Sciences (including Pandemic Preparedness Applications)   
  During the last decade, research in Biomedicine and Life Sciences has dramatically changed thanks to the continuous developments in High Performance Computing and highly Distributed Computing. The recent pandemic caused by Sars-CoV2 has clearly demonstrated the critical role of e-Infrastructures such high performance, high throughput and clouds infrastructure, but also of big-data and machine learning solutions to support the worldwide efforts to fight this pandemic. This track aims at discussing problems, solutions and application examples in the fields of health and life sciences, with a particular focus on non-technical end users. We invite in particular submissions concentrating on applications of pandemic response and preparedness in the areas of e.g. Drug discovery, Vaccine design, Structural biology, Bioinformatics, Medical imaging, Epidemiological studies and other Public health applications. Submissions should ideally highlight how different e-Science / e-Infrastructure solutions are being applied to fight / prepare for pandemics.  
   
  (3) Earth & Environmental Sciences & Biodiversity Applications   
  Environmental sciences are placing an increasing emphasis on the understanding of the Earth as a single, highly complex, coupled system with living and dead organisms. For example, feedback involving oceanic and atmospheric processes can have major consequences for the long-term development of the climate system, which in turn affects biodiversity, natural hazards and can control the development of the cryosphere and lithosphere. In this setting, natural disaster mitigation is one of the most critical regional issues in Asia. Despite the diversity of environmental sciences, many projects share the same significant challenges, where scientific computing and information technology play a central role in understanding data and studying complex systems. Technical challenges start with the collection of data from multiple distributed sensors (potentially in very remote locations) and the management of large data sets. Proper data management requires metadata fully specifying how, when and where the data were produced. Finally, results need to be presented to scientific users and stakeholders in a concise and intuitive form, requiring appropriate post-processing. This session addresses how these challenges are being handled, in particular with the aids of e-Science paradigms.  
   
  (4) Social Sciences, Arts & Humanities (SSAH) Applications   
  Disciplines across the Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities (SSAH) have critically engaged with technological innovations such as grid- and cloud computing, and, most recently, various data analytic technologies. The increasing availability of data, ranging from social media text data to consumer big data has led to an increasing interest in analysis methods such as natural language processing, social network analysis, machine learning and text mining. These developments pose challenges as well as opening up opportunities and members of the SSAH community have been at the forefront of discussions about the impact that novel forms of data, novel computational infrastructures and novel analytical methods have for the pursuit of science endeavors and our understanding of what science is and can be.  
   
  The ISGC 2023 SSAH track invites papers and presentations covering applications demonstrating the opportunities of new technologies or critically engaging with their methodological implications in the Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities. Innovative application of analytical tools for survey data, social media data, and government (open) data are welcome. We also invite contributions that critically reflect on the following subjects: (1) the impact that ubiquitous and mobile access to information and communication technologies have for society more generally, especially around topics such as smart cities, civic engagement, and digital journalism; (2) philosophical and methodological reflections on the development of the techniques and the approaches by which data scientists use to pursue knowledge.  

  2. Technologies that provide access and exploitation of different site resources and infrastructures   
   
  (5) Virtual Research Environment (including tools, services, workflows, portals, … etc.)   
  Virtual Research Environments (VRE) provide an intuitive, easy-to-use and secure access to (federated) computing resources for solving scientific problems, trying to hide the complexity of the underlying infrastructure, the heterogeneity of the resources, and the interconnecting middleware. Behind the scenes, VREs comprise tools, middleware and portal technologies, workflow automation as well a security solutions for layered and multifaceted applications. Topics of interest include but are not limited to: (1) Real-world experiences building and/or using VREs to gain new scientific knowledge; (2) Middleware technologies, tools, services beyond the state-of-the-art for VREs; (3) Science gateways as specific VRE environments, (4) Innovative technologies to enable VREs on arbitrary devices, including Internet-of-Things; and (5) One-step-ahead workflow integration and automation in VREs.  

  (6) Data Management & Big Data   
  The rapid growth of the data available to scientists and scholars – in terms of Velocity and Variety as well as sheer Volume – is transforming research across disciplines. Increasingly these data sets are generated not just through experiments, but as a byproduct of our day-to-day digital lives. This track explores the consequences of this growth, and encourages submissions relating to two aspects in particular - firstly, the conceptual models and analytical techniques required to process data at scale; secondly, approaches and tools for managing and creating these digital assets throughout their lifecycle.  
   
  3. Infrastructure for Research   
   
  (7) Network, Security, Infrastructure & Operations   
  Networking and the connected e-Infrastructures are becoming ubiquitous. Ensuring the smooth operation and integrity of the services for research communities in a rapidly changing environment are key challenges. This track focuses on the current state of the art and recent advances in these areas: networking, infrastructure, operations, and security. The scope of this track includes advances in high-performance networking (software defined networks, community private networks, the IPv4 to IPv6 transition, cross-domain provisioning), the connected data and compute infrastructures (storage and compute systems architectures, improving service and site reliability, interoperability between infrastructures, data centre models), monitoring tools and metrics, service management (ITIL and SLAs), and infrastructure/systems operations and management.  
  Also included here are issues related to the integrity, reliability, and security of services and data: developments in security middleware, operational security, security policy, federated identity management, community management, and lessons learned from operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Submissions should address solutions in at least one of these areas.  

  (8) Infrastructure Clouds and Virtualizations   
  This track will focus on the development of cloud infrastructures and on the use of cloud computing and virtualization technologies in large-scale (distributed) computing environments in science and technology. We solicit papers describing underlying virtualization and "cloud" technology including integration of accelerators and support for specific needs of AI/ML and DNN, scientific applications and case studies related to using such technology in large scale infrastructure as well as solutions overcoming challenges and leveraging opportunities in this setting. Of particular interest are results exploring the usability of virtualization and infrastructure clouds from the perspective of machine learning and other scientific applications, the performance, reliability and fault-tolerance of solutions used, and data management issues. Papers dealing with the cost, price, and cloud markets, with security and privacy, as well as portability and standards, are also most welcome.  
   
  (9) Converging High Performance Computing Infrastructures: Supercomputers, clouds, accelerators   
  The classical simulation-oriented computing is nowadays complemented by the machined deep learning approaches. This requires novel approaches to build and integrate high performance computing infrastructures, combining supercomputers, clouds, and specialized accelerator and artificial intelligence hardware. The integration of these different systems, often provided by different owners and different location, requires new ideas for distribution and federation.  
   
  This track solicits recent research and development achievements and best practices in building and exploiting these converging high performance infrastructures or their components. The topics of interest include, but are not limited to the followings: (1) Building and use of modern high performance computing systems, including special support for AI and DNN in particular; (2) Experiences, use cases and best practices on the development and operation of large-scale heterogeneous applications; (3) Integration and interoperability to support coordinated federated use of different e-infrastructures (supercomputers, accelerated clouds, …) and their building blocks; (4) Use of virtualization techniques and containers to support access to and portability across different heterogeneous systems; (5) Performance of different applications on these integrated high performance infrastructures.  
   
  (10) Artificial Intelligence (AI)   
  During the last decade, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and statistical learning techniques have started to become pervasive in scientific applications, exploring the adoption of novel algorithms, modifying the design principles of application workflows, and impacting the way in which grid and cloud computing services are used by a diverse set of scientific communities. This track aims at discussing problems, solutions and application examples related to this area of research, ranging from R&D activities to production-ready solutions. Topics of interests in this track include: AI-enabled scientific workflows; novel approaches in scientific applications adopting machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques; cloud-integrated statistical learning as-a-service solutions; anomaly detection techniques; predictive and prescriptive maintenance; experience with MLOps practices; AI-enabled adaptive simulations; experience on ML/DL models training and inference on different hardware resources for scientific applications.

 About INISTA 2023    

 International Conference on INnovations in Intelligent SysTems and Applications (INISTA) has been organized since 2005. It aims to bring together the researchers from the entire spectrum of the multi-disciplinary fields of intelligent systems and to establish effective means of communication between them.  

 Call For Papers    
 Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers to INISTA 2023. The topics of interest cover the entire spectrum of the multi-disciplinary fields of intelligent systems and related applications.  

 Call For Special Sessions    
 The International Conference on Innovations in Intelligent SysTems and Applications 2023 (INISTA 2023) welcomes and encourages the proposal of special sessions to be held during the conference.  

 Call for tutorials    
 INISTA 2023 invites proposals for the Tutorial Track. Each tutorial should cover a single topic in depth. Tutorials will provide an interactive space for research and experienced tutors to present the state-of-the-art research, latest development, and applications of specific intelligent systems.  

 Participation Modes    
 We are glad to announce that INISTA will be back to an in-person conference! We look forward to welcoming the participants to Tunisia. However, we will keep monitoring the situation of the pandemic to decide later if remote participation would be possible for those having travel restrictions.

 CO-SPONSORED BY  

 About ISoLA  
  The ISoLA Symposium is a forum for developers, users, and researchers to discuss issues related to the adoption and use of rigorous tools for the specification, analysis, verification, certification, construction, test, and maintenance of systems from the point of view of their different application domains. To bridge the gap between designers and developers of (formal methods based) rigorous tools, and users in engineering and in other disciplines, it fosters and exploits synergetic relationships among scientists, engineers, software developers, decision makers, and other critical thinkers.  

  The intended character of ISoLA  
  ISoLA aims at a thematically coherent program with maximum value for the participants. In particular we want to be attractive for people with practice background, who come to ISoLA to orient themselves concerning the leading edge technologies and their impact on their fields, to get ideas for new directions, and to establish (international) cooperations. Track organizers are therefore encouraged to invite appropriate experts in the field, which are able to present their ideas and results in an impact-oriented fashion, illustrating the potential of their area of competence and of their current research in a way that is accessible by the people in need for new solutions.Thus an important intended outcome is an intensified dialogue between research and (industrial) application, a goal that is also reflected in the organizational structure: sessions consist of 20-minute talks on related subjects with a 30 minute concluding panel discussion, which underlines our symposium-like intention.

 Call for Papers for LATIN 2024  
 Important dates  
 Paper submission: 2 October 2023  
 Author notification: 20 December 2023  
 Camera-ready: 8 January 2024  
 LATIN Symposium: 18 to 22 March 2024  
 Submissions  
 Submissions are limited to fifteen (15) single-column letter-size pages in Springer LNCS format (see LNCS author guidelines at http://www.springer.com/la/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines  ). This page limit includes figures and references, but it does not include an optional appendix. Proofs omitted due to space constraints must be placed in the appendix, which will be read by the program committee members at their discretion. In particular appendices of accepted papers are not going to be published in the proceedings. The main part of the submission should therefore contain a clear technical presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper’s importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims.  
 The conference employs a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work is in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, references should not be omitted or anonymized.  
 Papers should be submitted electronically via the EasyChair submission system at  
 https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=latin2024   
 Simultaneous submission of papers to any other conference with published proceedings, as well as the submission of previously published papers, is not allowed. Papers must be written in English. For each accepted paper at least one author must register and attend the symposium (in person) to present it. Moreover, an author cannot register for multiple papers. That is, each accepted paper must have its own registrant.

   LATIN 2012  

 LATIN 2012 took place in Arequipa, Peru. Arequipa, founded in 1540, is Peru's second largest urban area, with a population of over 1.1 million. The city is located 1,000 kilometers southeast of Peru's capital, Lima, at 2,235 meters above sea level and is next to three volcanoes: the still-active Misti and the extinct Chachani and Pichu Pichu. The weather is sunny year-round, warm during the day and cool at night. The average temperature from January to May is approximately 15 degrees Celsius, with a high around 20 degrees Celsius. Arequipa is an important center of Peruvian arts and culture. Its downtown area, with buildings made of white volcanic rock (sillar) blending native and Spanish styles, is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Arequipa's Main Square (Plaza de Armas) is among Peru's most beautiful, with an impressive cathedral and colonial arcaded buildings full of restaurants and cafés.  
 A notable attraction near the square is the 400-year old Santa Catalina Monastery, which is like a city within the city. The Monastery will be the location of the LATIN 2012 banquet. Not too far from the bustling downtown area, there are quiet neighborhoods where you can take a pleasant stroll. One of these is Yanahuara, with a charming square and excellent view of the city, the mountains, and the surrounding countryside. Another is San Lazaro, with pedestrian streets and winding alleys. San Lazaro is the location of San Pablo Catholic University (UCSP) where LATIN 2012 will be held. The UCSP campus lies along the Chili River and has a clear view of the Misti volcano. All over the city there are excellent restaurants, where you can sample Arequipa's cuisine, which occupies a special place in Peru's world-renowned gastronomy.

   LATIN 2010  

 LATIN 2010 took place in Oaxaca, Mexico. Oaxaca is a city located in a valley surrounded by mountains, 500 km south of Mexico City. Not far lay the beautiful beaches of Huatulco and the southern Mexican tropical rain forest. The surrounding mountainous terrain gave raise to a variety of indigenous cultures with their own language and tradition with the Mixtec and Zapotec culture being the better known. It has a very pleasant climate, characteristic of high altitude tropical sites. The historical center of Oaxaca has been declared by UNESCO to be a "World Heritage Site" because of its colonial architecture. In the surrounding area there are a large number of archaeological sites. A few blocks north of the zócalo is the magnificent 16th-century monastery and church of Santo Domingo. It is without a doubt one of Mexico's most ornately decorated churches. The austerity of the façade contrasts with the exuberant Baroque of its interior.  
 There are numerous attractions in the surrounding areas. No trip to Oaxaca is complete without a visit to Monte Albán, one of Mexico's great treasures. Built on a hilltop flattened by the Zapotec Indians over 2,500 years ago, Monte Alban was once a holy city of more than 25,000 inhabitants. The expansive ruins consist of a great central plaza surrounded by buildings, temples, an observatory, ball court and burial tombs. Magnificent stone carvings on vertical stone slabs date to 700b.c. The view from Monte Alban of Oaxaca Valley is spectacular, and the site is appealing to non-archaeological buffs as well.

Situated at the confluence of two navigable rivers, Valdivia is one of the south's most charismatic cities. Nearby Spanish forts at Corral and Niebla are reminders of the city's importance during the colonial era, when it was one of few fortified cities maintained by the Spanish in Mapuche Indian territory; subtle German architecture dates from the late 19th-century influx of European immigrants. The Rio Cruces Nature Sanctuary, a protected wetlands north of the city, is home to a variety of aquatic birds and is a favorite destination for boat trips.

 RERS – DIME Days      

 11th International Symposium On Leveraging Applications of Formal Methods, Verification and Validation  

 The ISoLA Symposium is a forum for developers, users, and researchers to discuss issues related to the adoption and use of rigorous tools for the specification, analysis, verification, certification, construction, test, and maintenance of systems from the point of view of their different application domains. To bridge the gap between designers and developers of (formal methods based) rigorous tools, and users in engineering and in other disciplines, it fosters and exploits synergetic relationships among scientists, engineers, software developers, decision makers, and other critical thinkers.   
 In particular, by providing a venue for the discussion of common problems, requirements, algorithms, methodologies, and practices, ISoLA aims at supporting researchers in their quest to improve the utility, reliability, flexibility and efficiency of tools for building systems and users in their search of adequate solutions to their problems. Applications and case studies with a conceptual message and experience papers with a clear link to tool construction are all encouraged.

 Title  : Unification Modulo Equational Theories in Languages with Binding Operators 
 Abtract  : Unification (i.e., solving equations between terms) is a key step in the implementation of logic programming languages and theorem provers and is also used in type inference algorithms for functional languages and as a mechanism to analyse rewrite-based specifications (e.g., to find critical pairs). Matching is a version of unification in which only one of the terms in the equation can be instantiated.  
  Often, operators satisfy equational axioms (e.g., associativity commutativity), which must be taken into account during the unification or matching process. In addition, when the expressions to be unified involve binding operators (as is the case when representing programs, logics, computation models, etc.), unification and matching algorithms must take into account the alpha-equivalence relation generated by the binders.  
  In this talk, we present matching and unification algorithms for languages that include binding operators as well as operators that satisfy equational axioms, such as associativity and commutativity.

 Title  : On-The-Fly Verification via Incremental, Interactive Abstract Interpretation with CiaoPP and VeriFly 
 Abtract  : Ciao Prolog pioneered the idea of being able to optionally and gradually add assertions or contracts to programs in order to offer formal guarantees, a now very popular solution for solving the classic trade-offs between dynamic and static languages. This approach is enabled by Ciao’s program analysis and verification framework, CiaoPP, which performs abstract interpretation-based context- and path-sensitive analysis to infer information against which assertions are checked to achieve verification or flag errors statically. The framework supports multiple other languages in addition to Prolog, from machine code to smart contracts, by translation into Horn clauses. Program semantics is computed over different user-definable abstract domains, via efficient fixpoint computation. This allows inference and verification of both functional and non-functional properties, including, e.g., energy or ’gas’ consumption.  
  While this type of verification can be performed offline (e.g., as part of con- tinuous integration) it is very useful when it occurs interactively during software development, flagging errors as the program is written. However, while context- and path-sensitive global analysis over complex domains can provide the preci- sion needed for effective verification and optimization, it can also be expensive when applied to large code bases, sometimes making interactive use impracti- cal. On the other hand, in many program development situations modifications are small and isolated within a few components. The modular and incremental fixpoint algorithms used by CiaoPP take advantage of this to reuse as much as possible previous analysis results, reducing response times in interactive use.  
  In this talk we will review these ideas and show how the integration of the Ciao abstract interpretation framework within different IDEs takes advantage of our efficient and incremental fixpoint to achieve effective verification on-the-fly as the program is developed. We also demonstrate a number of embeddings of this framework within the browser, and show as an example an application for building interactive tutorials, which we have used for teaching verification and abstract interpretation.

 Overview  
   
 The aim of the LOPSTR series  is to stimulate and promote international research and collaboration on logic-based program development. LOPSTR is open to contributions in logic-based program development in any language paradigm. LOPSTR has a reputation for being a lively, friendly forum for presenting and discussing work in progress.  
 LOPSTR 2023 will be held in-person at Hotel Cascais Miragem  in Cascais, Lisbon, Portugal and will be co-located with PPDP 2023 as part of SPLASH 2023. At least one of the authors of the accepted paper is expected to attend the conference and present the paper. Information about venue and travel is available on the SPLASH 2023 website  .  
 Topics of interest cover all aspects of logic-based program development, all stages of the software life cycle, and issues of both programming-in-the-small and programming-in-the-large, including, but not limited to:  
 synthesis 
  transformation 
  specialization 
  inversion 
  composition 
  optimisation 
  specification 
  analysis and verification 
    
 testing and certification 
  program and model manipulation 
  AI-methods for program development 
  verification and testing of AI-based systems 
  transformational techniques in software engineering 
  logic-based methods for security, cyber-physical and distributed system 
  applications, tools and industrial practice 

 Survey papers that present some aspects of the above topics from a new perspective and papers that describe experience with industrial applications and case studies are also welcome.  

 PAPER SUBMISSION  
   
 Submissions can be made in two categories:  
 Regular Papers (15 pages max.) 
  Short Papers (8 pages max.) 
    
 References do NOT count towards the page limit. Additional pages may be used for appendices not intended for publication. Reviewers are not required to read the appendices, and thus papers should be intelligible without them. All submissions must be written in English. Submissions must not substantially overlap with papers/tools that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal, conference, or workshop with refereed proceedings.  
 Submissions of Regular Papers  must describe the original work. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally published workshop proceedings may be submitted (please contact the PC chair in case of questions).  
 Submissions of Short Papers  may include presentations of exciting if not fully polished research and tool demonstrations that are of academic and industrial interest. Tool demonstrations should describe the relevant system, usability, and implementation aspects of a tool.  
  
 All accepted papers  will be included  in the conference proceedings  and published  by Springer as a Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)  volume.  
 After the symposium, a selection of a few best papers will be invited for submission to rapid publication  in the Journal of Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)  . Authors of selected papers will be invited to revise and/or extend their submissions to be considered for publication. The papers submitted to TPLP will be subject to the standard reviewing process of the journal.  

 Submission Guidelines  
   
 Authors should submit an electronic copy of the paper (written in English) in PDF, formatted in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science style. Each submission must include on its first page the paper title; authors and their affiliations; contact author's email; abstract; and three to four keywords which will be used to assist the PC in selecting appropriate reviewers for the paper. Authors should consult Springer's authors' instructions at the author's page  , and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX  (available also in overleaf  ) or for Word  , for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs  in their papers. In addition, upon acceptance, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form  . The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.  
  
 Page numbers (and, if possible, line numbers) should appear on the manuscript to help the reviewers in writing their report. So, for LaTeX we recommend that authors use:  
 \pagestyle{plain}  
  \usepackage{lineno}  
  \linenumbers  
   Papers should be submitted via EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lopstr2023   

 Best Paper Award  
   
 Thanks to Springer's sponsorship, two best paper awards (one for each submission category) will be given at LOPSTR 2023. The program committee will select the winning papers based on relevance, originality and technical quality but may also take authorship into account (e.g. a student paper).

 Engineering a Preprocessor for Symmetry Detection   
 Authors:  Markus Anders, Pascal Schweitzer, and Julian Stieß  
  Abstract    
 State-of-the-art solvers for symmetry detection in combinatorial objects are becoming increasingly sophisticated software libraries. Most of the solvers were initially designed with inputs from combinatorics in mind (nauty, bliss, Traces, dejavu). They excel at dealing with a complicated core of the input. Others focus on practical instances that exhibit sparsity. They excel at dealing with comparatively easy but extremely large substructures of the input (saucy). In practice, these differences manifest in significantly diverging performances on different types of graph classes. We engineer a preprocessor for symmetry detection. The result is a tool designed to shrink sparse, large substructures of the input graph. On most of the practical instances, the preprocessor improves the overall running time significantly for many of the state-of-the-art solvers. At the same time, our benchmarks show that the additional overhead is negligible. Overall we obtain single algorithms with competitive performance across all benchmark graphs. As such, the preprocessor bridges the disparity between solvers that focus on combinatorial graphs and large practical graphs. In fact, on most of the practical instances the combined setup significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art.

 Authors:  Giorgos Kritikakis and Ioannis G. Tollis  
  Abstract    
 We present a fast and practical algorithm to compute the transitive closure (TC) of a directed graph. It is based on computing a reachability indexing scheme of a directed acyclic graph (DAG), G = (V, E). Given any path/chain decomposition of G we show how to compute in parameterized linear time such a reachability scheme that can answer reachability queries in constant time. The experimental results reveal that our method is significantly faster in practice than the theoretical bounds imply, indicating that path/chain decomposition algorithms can be applied to obtain fast and practical solutions to the transitive closure (TC) problem. Furthermore, we show that the number of non-transitive edges of a DAG G is ≤ width*|V| and that we can find a substantially large subset of the transitive edges of G in linear time using a path/chain decomposition. Our extensive experimental results show the interplay between these concepts in various models of DAGs.

 Partitioning the Bags of a Tree Decomposition into Cliques   
 Authors:  Thomas Bläsius, Maximilian Katzmann, and Marcus Wilhelm  
  Abstract    
 We consider a variant of treewidth that we call clique-partitioned treewidth in which each bag is partitioned into cliques. This is motivated by the recent development of FPT-algorithms based on similar parameters for various problems. With this paper, we take a first step towards computing clique-partitioned tree decompositions. Our focus lies on the subproblem of computing clique partitions, i.e., for each bag of a given tree decomposition, we compute an optimal partition of the induced subgraph into cliques. The goal here is to minimize the product of the clique sizes (plus 1). We show that this problem is NP-hard. We also describe four heuristic approaches as well as an exact branch-and-bound algorithm. Our evaluation shows that the branch-and-bound solver is sufficiently efficient to serve as a good baseline. Moreover, our heuristics yield solutions close to the optimum. As a bonus, our algorithms allow us to compute first upper bounds for the clique-partitioned treewidth of real-world networks. A comparison to traditional treewidth indicates that clique-partitioned treewidth is a promising parameter for graphs with high clustering.

 Subset Wavelet Trees   
 Authors:  Jarno N. Alanko, Elena Biagi, Simon J. Puglisi, and Jaakko Vuohtoniemi  
  Abstract    
 Given an alphabet Σ of σ = |Σ| symbols, a degenerate (or indeterminate) string X is a sequence X = X[0],X[1]…, X[n-1] of n subsets of Σ. Since their introduction in the mid 70s, degenerate strings have been widely studied, with applications driven by their being a natural model for sequences in which there is a degree of uncertainty about the precise symbol at a given position, such as those arising in genomics and proteomics. In this paper we introduce a new data structural tool for degenerate strings, called the subset wavelet tree (SubsetWT). A SubsetWT supports two basic operations on degenerate strings: subset-rank(i,c), which returns the number of subsets up to the i-th subset in the degenerate string that contain the symbol c; and subset-select(i,c), which returns the index in the degenerate string of the i-th subset that contains symbol c. These queries are analogs of rank and select queries that have been widely studied for ordinary strings. Via experiments in a real genomics application in which degenerate strings are fundamental, we show that subset wavelet trees are practical data structures, and in particular offer an attractive space-time tradeoff. Along the way we investigate data structures for supporting (normal) rank queries on base-4 and base-3 sequences, which may be of independent interest. Our C++ implementations of the data structures are available at https://github.com/jnalanko/SubsetWT.

 Engineering Shared-Memory Parallel Shuffling to Generate Random Permutations In-Place   
 Authors:  Manuel Penschuck  
  Abstract    
 Shuffling is the process of placing elements into a random order such that any permutation occurs with equal probability. It is an important building block in virtually all scientific areas. We engineer, - to the best of our knowledge - for the first time, a practically fast, parallel shuffling algorithm with O(√n log n) parallel depth that requires only poly-logarithmic auxiliary memory (with high probability). In an empirical evaluation, we compare our implementations with a number of existing solutions on various computer architectures. Our algorithms consistently achieve the highest through-put on all machines. Further, we demonstrate that the runtime of our parallel algorithm is comparable to the time that other algorithms may take to acquire the memory from the operating system to copy the input.

 Proxying Betweenness Centrality Rankings in Temporal Networks   
 Authors:  Ruben Becker, Pierluigi Crescenzi, Antonio Cruciani, and Bojana Kodric  
  Abstract    
 Identifying influential nodes in a network is arguably one of the most important tasks in graph mining and network analysis. A large variety of centrality measures, all aiming at correctly quantifying a node’s importance in the network, have been formulated in the literature. One of the most cited ones is the betweenness centrality, formally introduced by Freeman (Sociometry, 1977). On the other hand, researchers have recently been very interested in capturing the dynamic nature of real-world networks by studying temporal graphs, rather than static ones. Clearly, centrality measures, including the betweenness centrality, have also been extended to temporal graphs. Buß et al. (KDD, 2020) gave algorithms to compute various notions of temporal betweenness centrality, including the perhaps most natural one - shortest temporal betweenness. Their algorithm computes centrality values of all nodes in time O(n³ T²), where n is the size of the network and T is the total number of time steps. For real-world networks, which easily contain tens of thousands of nodes, this complexity becomes prohibitive. Thus, it is reasonable to consider proxies for shortest temporal betweenness rankings that are more efficiently computed, and, therefore, allow for measuring the relative importance of nodes in very large temporal graphs. In this paper, we compare several such proxies on a diverse set of real-world networks. These proxies can be divided into global and local proxies. The considered global proxies include the exact algorithm for static betweenness (computed on the underlying graph), prefix foremost temporal betweenness of Buß et al., which is more efficiently computable than shortest temporal betweenness, and the recently introduced approximation approach of Santoro and Sarpe (WWW, 2022). As all of these global proxies are still expensive to compute on very large networks, we also turn to more efficiently computable local proxies. Here, we consider temporal versions of the ego-betweenness in the sense of Everett and Borgatti (Social Networks, 2005), standard degree notions, and a novel temporal degree notion termed the pass-through degree, that we introduce in this paper and which we consider to be one of our main contributions. We show that the pass-through degree, which measures the number of pairs of neighbors of a node that are temporally connected through it, can be computed in nearly linear time for all nodes in the network and we experimentally observe that it is surprisingly competitive as a proxy for shortest temporal betweenness.

 Simple Runs-Bounded FM-Index Designs Are Fast   
 Authors:  Diego Díaz-Domínguez, Saska Dönges, Simon J. Puglisi, and Leena Salmela  
  Abstract    
 Given a string X of length n on alphabet σ, the FM-index data structure allows counting all occurrences of a pattern P of length m in O(m) time via an algorithm called backward search. An important difficulty when searching with an FM-index is to support queries on L, the Burrows-Wheeler transform of X, while L is in compressed form. This problem has been the subject of intense research for 25 years now. Run-length encoding of L is an effective way to reduce index size, in particular when the data being indexed is highly-repetitive, which is the case in many types of modern data, including those arising from versioned document collections and in pangenomics. This paper takes a back-to-basics look at supporting backward search in FM-indexes, exploring and engineering two simple designs. The first divides the BWT string into blocks containing b symbols each and then run-length compresses each block separately, possibly introducing new runs (compared to applying run-length encoding once, to the whole string). Each block stores counts of each symbol that occurs before the block. This method supports the operation rank_c(L, i) (i.e., count the number of times c occurs in the prefix L[1..i]) by first determining the block i/b in which i falls and scanning the block to the appropriate position counting occurrences of c along the way. This partial answer to rank_c(L, i) is then added to the stored count of c symbols before the block to determine the final answer. Our second design has a similar structure, but instead divides the run-length-encoded version of L into blocks containing an equal number of runs. The trick then is to determine the block in which a query falls, which is achieved via a predecessor query over the block starting positions. We show via extensive experiments on a wide range of repetitive text collections that these FM-indexes are not only easy to implement, but also fast and space efficient in practice.

 Noisy Sorting Without Searching: Data Oblivious Sorting with Comparison Errors   
 Authors:  Ramtin Afshar, Michael Dillencourt, Michael T. Goodrich, and Evrim Ozel  
  Abstract    
 We provide and study several algorithms for sorting an array of n comparable distinct elements subject to probabilistic comparison errors. In this model, the comparison of two elements returns the wrong answer according to a fixed probability, p_e < 1/2, and otherwise returns the correct answer. The dislocation of an element is the distance between its position in a given (current or output) array and its position in a sorted array. There are various algorithms that can be utilized for sorting or near-sorting elements subject to probabilistic comparison errors, but these algorithms are not data oblivious because they all make heavy use of noisy binary searching. In this paper, we provide new methods for sorting with comparison errors that are data oblivious while avoiding the use of noisy binary search methods. In addition, we experimentally compare our algorithms and other sorting algorithms.

 Optimizing over the Efficient Set of a Multi-Objective Discrete Optimization Problem   
 Authors:  Satya Tamby and Daniel Vanderpooten  
  Abstract    
 Optimizing over the efficient set of a discrete multi-objective problem is a challenging issue. The main reason is that, unlike when optimizing over the feasible set, the efficient set is implicitly characterized. Therefore, methods designed for this purpose iteratively generate efficient solutions by solving appropriate single-objective problems. However, the number of efficient solutions can be quite large and the problems to be solved can be difficult practically. Thus, the challenge is both to minimize the number of iterations and to reduce the difficulty of the problems to be solved at each iteration. In this paper, a new enumeration scheme is proposed. By introducing some constraints and optimizing over projections of the search region, potentially large parts of the search space can be discarded, drastically reducing the number of iterations. Moreover, the single-objective programs to be solved can be guaranteed to be feasible, and a starting solution can be provided allowing warm start resolutions. This results in a fast algorithm that is simple to implement. Experimental computations on two standard multi-objective instance families show that our approach seems to perform significantly faster than the state of the art algorithm.

 Solving Directed Feedback Vertex Set by Iterative Reduction to Vertex Cover   
 Authors:  Sebastian Angrick, Ben Bals, Katrin Casel, Sarel Cohen, Tobias Friedrich, Niko Hastrich, Theresa Hradilak, Davis Issac, Otto Kißig, Jonas Schmidt, and Leo Wendt  
  Abstract    
 In the Directed Feedback Vertex Set (DFVS) problem, one is given a directed graph G = (V,E) and wants to find a minimum cardinality set S ⊆ V such that G-S is acyclic. DFVS is a fundamental problem in computer science and finds applications in areas such as deadlock detection. The problem was the subject of the 2022 PACE coding challenge. We develop a novel exact algorithm for the problem that is tailored to perform well on instances that are mostly bi-directed. For such instances, we adapt techniques from the well-researched vertex cover problem. Our core idea is an iterative reduction to vertex cover. To this end, we also develop a new reduction rule that reduces the number of not bi-directed edges. With the resulting algorithm, we were able to win third place in the exact track of the PACE challenge. We perform computational experiments and compare the running time to other exact algorithms, in particular to the winning algorithm in PACE. Our experiments show that we outpace the other algorithms on instances that have a low density of uni-directed edges.

 CompDP: A Framework for Simultaneous Subgraph Counting Under Connectivity Constraints   
 Authors:  Kengo Nakamura, Masaaki Nishino, Norihito Yasuda, and Shin-ichi Minato  
  Abstract    
 The subgraph counting problem computes the number of subgraphs of a given graph that satisfy some constraints. Among various constraints imposed on a graph, those regarding the connectivity of vertices, such as "these two vertices must be connected," have great importance since they are indispensable for determining various graph substructures, e.g., paths, Steiner trees, and rooted spanning forests. In this view, the subgraph counting problem under connectivity constraints is also important because counting such substructures often corresponds to measuring the importance of a vertex in network infrastructures. However, we must solve the subgraph counting problems multiple times to compute such an importance measure for every vertex. Conventionally, they are solved separately by constructing decision diagrams such as BDD and ZDD for each problem. However, even solving a single subgraph counting is a computationally hard task, preventing us from solving it multiple times in a reasonable time. In this paper, we propose a dynamic programming framework that simultaneously counts subgraphs for every vertex by focusing on similar connectivity constraints. Experimental results show that the proposed method solved multiple subgraph counting problems about 10-20 times faster than the existing approach for many problem settings.

 Multilinear Formulations for Computing a Nash Equilibrium of Multi-Player Games   
 Authors:  Miriam Fischer and Akshay Gupte  
  Abstract    
 We present multilinear and mixed-integer multilinear programs to find a Nash equilibrium in multi-player noncooperative games. We compare the formulations to common algorithms in Gambit, and conclude that a multilinear feasibility program finds a Nash equilibrium faster than any of the methods we compare it to, including the quantal response equilibrium method, which is recommended for large games. Hence, the multilinear feasibility program is an alternative method to find a Nash equilibrium in multi-player games, and outperforms many common algorithms. The mixed-integer formulations are generalisations of known mixed-integer programs for two-player games, however unlike two-player games, these mixed-integer programs do not give better performance than existing algorithms.

 Integer Programming Formulations and Cutting Plane Algorithms for the Maximum Selective Tree Problem   
 Authors:  Ömer Burak Onar, Tınaz Ekim, and Z. Caner Taşkın  
  Abstract    
 This paper considers the Maximum Selective Tree Problem (MSelTP) as a generalization of the Maximum Induced Tree problem. Given an undirected graph with a partition of its vertex set into clusters, MSelTP aims to choose the maximum number of vertices such that at most one vertex per cluster is selected and the graph induced by the selected vertices is a tree. To the best of our knowledge, MSelTP has not been studied before although several related optimization problems have been investigated in the literature. We propose two mixed integer programming formulations for MSelTP; one based on connectivity constraints, the other based on cycle elimination constraints. In addition, we develop two exact cutting plane procedures to solve the problem to optimality. On graphs with up to 25 clusters, up to 250 vertices, and varying densities, we conduct computational experiments to compare the results of two solution procedures with solving a compact integer programming formulation of MSelTP. Our experiments indicate that the algorithm CPAXnY outperforms the other procedures overall except for graphs with low density and large cluster size, and that the algorithm CPAX yields better results in terms of the average time of instances optimally solved and the overall average time.

 A Graph-Theoretic Formulation of Exploratory Blockmodeling   
 Authors:  Alexander Bille, Niels Grüttemeier, Christian Komusiewicz, and Nils Morawietz  
  Abstract    
 We present a new simple graph-theoretic formulation of the exploratory blockmodeling problem on undirected and unweighted one-mode networks. Our formulation takes as input the network G and the maximum number t of blocks for the solution model. The task is to find a minimum-size set of edge insertions and deletions that transform the input graph G into a graph G' with at most t neighborhood classes. Herein, a neighborhood class is a maximal set of vertices with the same neighborhood. The neighborhood classes of G' directly give the blocks and block interactions of the computed blockmodel. We analyze the classic and parameterized complexity of the exploratory blockmodeling problem, provide a branch-and-bound algorithm, an ILP formulation and several heuristics. Finally, we compare our exact algorithms to previous ILP-based approaches and show that the new algorithms are faster for t ≥ 4.

 FREIGHT: Fast Streaming Hypergraph Partitioning   
 Authors:  Kamal Eyubov, Marcelo Fonseca Faraj, and Christian Schulz  
  Abstract    
 Partitioning the vertices of a (hyper)graph into k roughly balanced blocks such that few (hyper)edges run between blocks is a key problem for large-scale distributed processing. A current trend for partitioning huge (hyper)graphs using low computational resources are streaming algorithms. In this work, we propose FREIGHT: a Fast stREamInG Hypergraph parTitioning algorithm which is an adaptation of the widely-known graph-based algorithm Fennel. By using an efficient data structure, we make the overall running of FREIGHT linearly dependent on the pin-count of the hypergraph and the memory consumption linearly dependent on the numbers of nets and blocks. The results of our extensive experimentation showcase the promising performance of FREIGHT as a highly efficient and effective solution for streaming hypergraph partitioning. Our algorithm demonstrates competitive running time with the Hashing algorithm, with a difference of a maximum factor of four observed on three fourths of the instances. Significantly, our findings highlight the superiority of FREIGHT over all existing (buffered) streaming algorithms and even the in-memory algorithm HYPE, with respect to both cut-net and connectivity measures. This indicates that our proposed algorithm is a promising hypergraph partitioning tool to tackle the challenge posed by large-scale and dynamic data processing.

 Arc-Flags Meet Trip-Based Public Transit Routing   
 Authors:  Ernestine Großmann, Jonas Sauer, Christian Schulz, and Patrick Steil  
  Abstract    
 We present Arc-Flag TB, a journey planning algorithm for public transit networks which combines Trip-Based Public Transit Routing (TB) with the Arc-Flags speedup technique. Compared to previous attempts to apply Arc-Flags to public transit networks, which saw limited success, our approach uses stronger pruning rules to reduce the search space. Our experiments show that Arc-Flag TB achieves a speedup of up to two orders of magnitude over TB, offering query times of less than a millisecond even on large countrywide networks. Compared to the state-of-the-art speedup technique Trip-Based Public Transit Routing Using Condensed Search Trees (TB-CST), our algorithm achieves similar query times but requires significantly less additional memory. Other state-of-the-art algorithms which achieve even faster query times, e.g., Public Transit Labeling, require enormous memory usage. In contrast, Arc-Flag TB offers a tradeoff between query performance and memory usage due to the fact that the number of regions in the network partition required by our algorithm is a configurable parameter. We also identify a previously undiscovered issue in the transfer precomputation of TB, which causes both TB-CST and Arc-Flag TB to answer some queries incorrectly. We provide discussion on how to resolve this issue in the future. Currently, Arc-Flag TB answers 1-6% of queries incorrectly, compared to over 20% for TB-CST on some networks.

 Greedy Heuristics for Judicious Hypergraph Partitioning   
 Authors:  Noah Wahl and Lars Gottesbüren  
  Abstract    
 We investigate the efficacy of greedy heuristics for the judicious hypergraph partitioning problem. In contrast to balanced partitioning problems, the goal of judicious hypergraph partitioning is to minimize the maximum load over all blocks of the partition. We devise strategies for initial partitioning and FM-style post-processing. In combination with a multilevel scheme, they beat the previous state-of-the-art solver - based on greedy set covers - in both running time (two to four orders of magnitude) and solution quality (18% to 45%). A major challenge that makes local greedy approaches difficult to use for this problem is the high frequency of zero-gain moves, for which we present and evaluate counteracting mechanisms.

 Hierarchical Relative Lempel-Ziv Compression   
 Authors:  Philip Bille, Inge Li Gørtz, Simon J. Puglisi, and Simon R. Tarnow  
  Abstract    
 Relative Lempel-Ziv (RLZ) parsing is a dictionary compression method in which a string S is compressed relative to a second string R (called the reference) by parsing S into a sequence of substrings that occur in R. RLZ is particularly effective at compressing sets of strings that have a high degree of similarity to the reference string, such as a set of genomes of individuals from the same species. With the now cheap cost of DNA sequencing, such datasets have become extremely abundant and are rapidly growing. In this paper, instead of using a single reference string for the entire collection, we investigate the use of different reference strings for subsets of the collection, with the aim of improving compression. In particular, we propose a new compression scheme hierarchical relative Lempel-Ziv (HRLZ) which form a rooted tree (or hierarchy) on the strings and then compress each string using RLZ with parent as reference, storing only the root of the tree in plain text. To decompress, we traverse the tree in BFS order starting at the root, decompressing children with respect to their parent. We show that this approach leads to a twofold improvement in compression on bacterial genome datasets, with negligible effect on decompression time compared to the standard single reference approach. We show that an effective hierarchy for a given set of strings can be constructed by computing the optimal arborescence of a completed weighted digraph of the strings, with weights as the number of phrases in the RLZ parsing of the source and destination vertices. We further show that instead of computing the complete graph, a sparse graph derived using locality-sensitive hashing can significantly reduce the cost of computing a good hierarchy, without adversely effecting compression performance.

 Exact and Approximate Range Mode Query Data Structures in Practice   
 Authors:  Meng He and Zhen Liu  
  Abstract    
 We conduct an experimental study on the range mode problem. In the exact version of the problem, we preprocess an array A, such that given a query range [a, b], the most frequent element in A[a, b] can be found efficiently. For this problem, our most important finding is that the strategy of using succinct data structures to encode more precomputed information not only helped Chan et al. (Linear-space data structures for range mode query in arrays, Theory of Computing Systems, 2013) improve previous results in theory but also helps us achieve the best time/space tradeoff in practice; we even go a step further to replace more components in their solution with succinct data structures and improve the performance further. In the approximate version of this problem, a (1+ε)-approximate range mode query looks for an element whose occurrences in A[a,b] is at least F_{a,b}/(1+ε), where F_{a,b} is the frequency of the mode in A[a,b]. We implement all previous solutions to this problems and find that, even when ε = 1/2, the average approximation ratio of these solutions is close to 1 in practice, and they provide much faster query time than the best exact solution. These solutions achieve different useful time-space tradeoffs, and among them, El-Zein et al. (On Approximate Range Mode and Range Selection, 30th International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation, 2019) provide us with one solution whose space usage is only 35.6% to 93.8% of the cost of storing the input array of 32-bit integers (in most cases, the space cost is closer to the lower end, and the average space cost is 20.2 bits per symbol among all datasets). Its non-succinct version also stands out with query support at least several times faster than other O(n/ε)-word structures while using only slightly more space in practice.

 Efficient Yao Graph Construction   
 Authors:  Daniel Funke and Peter Sanders  
  Abstract    
 Yao graphs are geometric spanners that connect each point of a given point set to its nearest neighbor in each of k cones drawn around it. Yao graphs were introduced to construct minimum spanning trees in d dimensional spaces. Moreover, they are used for instance in topology control in wireless networks. An optimal 𝒪(n log n)-time algorithm to construct Yao graphs for a given point set has been proposed in the literature but - to the best of our knowledge - never been implemented. Instead, algorithms with a quadratic complexity are used in popular packages to construct these graphs. In this paper we present the first implementation of the optimal Yao graph algorithm. We engineer the data structures required to achieve the 𝒪(n log n) time bound and detail algorithmic adaptations necessary to take the original algorithm from theory to practice. We propose a priority queue data structure that separates static and dynamic events and might be of independent interest for other sweepline algorithms. Additionally, we propose a new Yao graph algorithm based on a uniform grid data structure that performs well for medium-sized inputs. We evaluate our implementations on a wide variety of synthetic and real-world datasets and show that our implementation outperforms current publicly available implementations by at least an order of magnitude.

 Maximum Coverage in Sublinear Space, Faster   
 Authors:  Stephen Jaud, Anthony Wirth, and Farhana Choudhury  
  Abstract    
 Given a collection of m sets from a universe 𝒰, the Maximum Set Coverage problem consists of finding k sets whose union has largest cardinality. This problem is NP-Hard, but the solution can be approximated by a polynomial time algorithm up to a factor 1-1/e. However, this algorithm does not scale well with the input size. In a streaming context, practical high-quality solutions are found, but with space complexity that scales linearly with respect to the size of the universe n = |𝒰|. However, one randomized streaming algorithm has been shown to produce a 1-1/e-ε approximation of the optimal solution with a space complexity that scales only poly-logarithmically with respect to m and n. In order to achieve such a low space complexity, the authors used two techniques in their multi-pass approach: - F₀-sketching, allows to determine with great accuracy the number of distinct elements in a set using less space than the set itself. - Subsampling, consists of only solving the problem on a subspace of the universe. It is implemented using γ-independent hash functions. This article focuses on the sublinear-space algorithm and highlights the time cost of these two techniques, especially subsampling. We present optimizations that significantly reduce the time complexity of the algorithm. Firstly, we give some optimizations that do not alter the space complexity, number of passes and approximation quality of the original algorithm. In particular, we reanalyze the error bounds to show that the original independence factor of Ω(ε^{-2} k log m) can be fine-tuned to Ω(k log m); we also show how F₀-sketching can be removed. Secondly, we derive a new lower bound for the probability of producing a 1-1/e-ε approximation using only pairwise independence: 1- (4/(c k log m)) compared to 1-(2e/(m^{ck/6})) with Ω(k log m)-independence. Although the theoretical guarantees are weaker, suggesting the approximation quality would suffer, for large streams, our algorithms perform well in practice. Finally, our experimental results show that even a pairwise-independent hash-function sampler does not produce worse solution than the original algorithm, while running significantly faster by several orders of magnitude.
