Similar to previous years, ACML 2023 has two publication tracks  . Authors may submit either to: 
Conference Track: | (16-page limit with references) for which the proceedings will be published as a volume of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research Workshop and Conference Proceedings (PMLR).
 Journal Track: | (20-page limit with references) for which accepted papers will appear in a special issue of the Springer Machine Learning Journal (MLJ).
 Please note that submission procedures for the two tracks are different. Please read the instructions carefully before submitting.   
Conference Track 
Submission Deadline: June 30, 2023  June 23, 2023   For the conference track, please submit your manuscript via CMT at: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACML2023  . 
IMPORTANT:   When creating a new submission on CMT, please ensure you choose the "Conference"  track. 
The Latex submission template and style file can be found here: ACML2023_submission_template.zip  . 
 The Latex camera-ready template and style file can be found here: ACML2023_camera-ready_template.zip  . 
Manuscripts must be written in English, be a maximum of 16 pages (including references, appendices, etc.) and follow the PMLR style. If required, supplementary material may be submitted as a separate file, but reviewers are not obliged to consider this. 
All conference track submissions must be anonymized  . Submissions that are not anonymized, over-length, or not in the correct format will be rejected without review. To anonymize, simply leave the author information empty in the Tex template. There is no separate format for anonymizing. 
It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g., in arXiv) as long as it is not cited in the submission. 
Journal Track 
Submission Deadline: June 02, 2023  May 26, 2023   In addition to the conference track, this year’s ACML will run a journal track, similar to previous years. Papers that are accepted to the journal track must be presented at the conference in order to be published. 
IMPORTANT:   Similar to previous years, for the journal track, the abstract and the paper must be submitted to two different systems simultaneously   for the purpose of review management: 
First, please submit ONLY the title and abstract via CMT at: | https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACML2023. | (paper manuscript need not be submitted here). When creating the submission on CMT, please choose the | "Journal" | track.
 Then, please submit the paper via Springer’s Editorial Manager system at: | https://www.editorialmanager.com/mach. | When creating a new submission on Springer’s Editorial Manager, please make sure to choose | "S.I.: ACML 2023" | as the article type.
 For the journal track, manuscripts must be written in English with a maximum of 20 pages (including references, appendices, etc.). For the template and style files, please follow the instructions for authors on the journal website: https://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10994  . 
The journal track will follow the reviewing process of the Machine Learning journal. This includes allowing papers that require minor changes to be resubmitted after a first-round review. The journal track committee will aim to complete the reviewing process in time for this year’s conference. In the unlikely event that the reviewing process for a paper is not completed in time (for this year’s conference), the paper will not be considered for the conference and the review will be completed as a regular submission to the Machine Learning journal. 
The journal track review is single-blind, i.e., the authors’ identity will be visible to reviewers. It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. Submissions that are not in the correct format will be rejected without review. In addition, extended versions of published conference papers are not eligible for journal track submission. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g., in arXiv).
14. ACML_3 conference:

Some of our participants are unfortunately facing visa challenges  that might prevent them from joining us in person at the conference. We understand the immense effort and dedication it takes to contribute to ACM Multimedia 2023, and we want to reassure everyone that even if you cannot attend in person due to unforeseen circumstances, your paper will still be featured in the conference proceedings. Our team is dedicated to ensuring a fulfilling and enriching experience for all participants, whether they attend in person or online. We will do our utmost to accommodate any challenges and ensure a satisfactory conference experience for all. 
In addition, we’d like to inform you that your paper will be presented in a 2-minute teaser session for those attending in person. For those who may not be able to make it in person, we will also have 2-minute teaser sessions in separate offline sessions to ensure your research receives the attention it deserves.  
We hope to see as many of you as possible, and we thank you for your understanding.

Make sure to book your hotel stay at the Westin Hotel,  Ottawa conference hotel. The hotel  is at the center of the conference activity, and will allow you to network easily with other conference attendees. Also, it’s a quick trip to get to the program and functions, and just as quick to nip back to your room for a break. Staying at the conference hotel will provide a better conference experience! 
Everyone enjoys meeting in a comfortable conference venue, offering quality service and support for workshops, tutorials, plenary sessions, and other activities. As the transaction for those services and support, the conference guarantees that a percentage of attendees will stay in the hotel. The contract with the hotel then guarantees a specific number of sleeping rooms will be used each night during the conference. If the conference does not meet the contracted sleeping room commitment, the hotel gets paid anyway. Those unfilled rooms will cost the conference thousands of dollars. 
Please support ACMMM 2023 and SIGMM by staying at the Westin Hotel!

AAAI-23 Main Technical Track 
Call for Papers 
 All authors must complete a reproducibility checklist, which facilitates replication of the reported research.
 All authors are expected to be available to review (light load), unless extenuating circumstances apply.
 NeurIPS-22 Fast Track: rejected papers with *final, average* scores of at least 4.9 may be submitted directly into AAAI-23’s Phase 2 along with, for example, previous reviews and paper ID.
 The purpose of the AAAI conference series is to promote research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and foster scientific exchange between researchers, practitioners, scientists, students, and engineers across the entirety of AI and its affiliated disciplines. AAAI-23 is the Thirty-Seventh AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. The theme of this conference is to create collaborative bridges  within and beyond AI. Like previous AAAI conferences, AAAI-23 will feature technical paper presentations, special tracks, invited speakers, workshops, tutorials, poster sessions, senior member presentations, competitions, and exhibit programs, and two new activities: a Bridge Program and a Lab Program. Many of these activities are tailored to the theme of bridges and all are selected according to the highest standards, with additional programs for students and young researchers. 
Driven by its disciplinary diversity, AAAI has incubated numerous AI sub-disciplines and conferences and has nurtured for decades the cohesion of AI. New communities often emerge when two or more disciplines come together in order to explore new opportunities and perspectives; today both are plentiful. The purpose of this year’s Bridge Program is to tap into new sources of innovation by cultivating sustained collaboration between two or more communities, directed towards a common goal. Our interpretation of bridge  is broad and encompasses disciplines both within and outside of AI. Hence, the communities that our Bridge Program is intended to bring together could be distinct subfields of AI, such as planning and learning, or different disciplines that contribute to and benefit from AI, such as AI and the humanities. 
We plan for AAAI-23 to be an in-person conference and are exploring opportunities to complement this with remote participation. Given the volatile situation, however, the exact format of the conference can only be decided at a later stage.

ADCOM 2023: Adaptive, Generative and Bio-inspired AI in Computing and Communication  
The Advanced Computing and Communications Society  (ACCS) in association with the Digital University Kerala  announces the 28th annual International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications  (ADCOM 2023) at Maker Village, Kochi during 8th – 10th December 2023. 
ADCOM, the flagship Systems Conference of the ACCS, is a major annual international meeting that draws leading scientists and researchers in computational and communications engineering from across industry and academia. ADCOM highlights the growing importance of Large-Scale Systems Engineering and provides the platform to share, discuss and witness leading edge research and trends. 
ADCOM 2023 explores the current state-of-art AI covering a broad spectrum of adaptive, generative and bio-inspired algorithms and/or hardware useful in computing and communications. Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can create new content, such as text, images, or other media, from scratch. Generative AI models are trained on large datasets of existing content, and then use this data to learn the patterns and rules that govern how that content is created. Generative AI has a wide range of potential applications in Content creation, Data augmentation, Artificial intelligence assistant, Entertainment, Product design etc.

Call for papers  
The ACM MobiCom conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions in the field of wireless networking and mobile computing. MobiCom solicits papers that address important research challenges and build practical working systems. Successful papers should propose novel ideas to attack such problems through rigorous analysis, system design and real-world measurement or deployment of mobile networks, systems and applications. 
 
 MobiCom’23 will emphasize novelty and creativity while, at the same time, taking a broader and more inclusive view of wireless and mobile systems research. On one hand, the more novel the concept, the harder it can be to fully develop or evaluate all its aspects. On the other hand the more practical and developed the system, the more simple and sometimes known techniques must be leveraged. The review process will take both cases into account as intellectual merit and novelty can be found in techniques, system designs, implementations, and applications. The review process will also favor papers that describe how the authors will provide access to well-documented datasets, modeling and/or simulation tools, and codebases to support the reproducibility of their methods as well as papers that highlight and discuss not only the significance but also the limitations of the work. 
 
 Unlike in previous years, MobiCom’23 will not have separate categories of challenge, experience, and verification papers. However, we do encourage the submission of experience papers as full papers that provide detailed technical insight into real-world deployments of novel technologies and systems. MobiCom'23 will also incorporate early notifications for papers rejected in round 1 and rebuttals as described below in more detail.

 Two Deadlines, Early Notification, Rebuttals, and One-shot Revision 

 MobiCom 2023 offers authors the option of two deadlines and keeps the one-shot revision process to enhance the timeliness and quality of the scientific results from the research community. Each paper will go through the same rigorous reviewing process as in previous MobiCom conferences. The review process for each deadline will involve two rounds. Papers that are not selected to proceed after the first round will receive an early notification, including reviews. After the second round of reviews, the reviews will be released to the authors and who will have one week to submit a rebuttal. 
 
 Rebuttals 
MobiCom will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to the final consideration of the papers at the program committee meeting. Authors must limit their responses to (a) correcting factual errors in the reviews or (b) directly addressing questions posed by reviewers. Responses should be limited to clarifying the submitted work. In particular, responses must not include new experiments, new data, or new figures, describe additional work completed since submission or promise additional work to follow. 
 
 The submission of a rebuttal is optional. Rebuttals will be limited to a maximum of 1000 words submitted in the online submission form. It is worth noting that available reviews will be released at the above-mentioned times. However, additional reviews might be solicited or submitted after the rebuttal period. 
 
 Final decisions will be one of the following 

 Accept | : Accepted papers will be presented at the MobiCom conference and appear as part of the proceedings and the MobiCom website. Note all the papers in this category will initially be | conditionally accepted | . The papers that go through a successful | anonymous | shepherding process will eventually be accepted.
 Reject | : Rejected after reviewed papers cannot be resubmitted until 11 months have passed since the last MobiCom deadline they were submitted to. We strongly encourage the authors to address reviewers' feedback before re-submitting the paper to MobiCom.
 One-Shot-Revision | : Papers, where a revision is required, will be given specific action points and can be resubmitted for the | next | deadline. For such papers, the reviewers will articulate a maximum of three major changes/clarifications that they would like to see. After the resubmission, the paper will be evaluated based on whether the authors have properly addressed the reviewers’ requests. Unlike in the shepherding process, the requested action points may include running additional experiments that obtain specific results and could take more than 4-6 weeks. During this revision period, the paper is still considered under review to MobiCom and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration.
 
 Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers 
The authors of accepted MobiCom 2023 papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee that will assess how well the submitted artifacts support the work described in the accepted papers. Participation in Artifact Evaluation is voluntary and has no influence on the paper’s acceptance, but is strongly encouraged. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive badges printed on the papers themselves. Additional details on the Artifact Evaluation process can be found here. 
 
 Submission Instructions 

 All paper submissions will be handled electronically at the MobiCom ’23 paper submission website  . Authors should prepare a PDF version of their full paper. All submitted papers will be evaluated through a double-blind  reviewing process, with the identities of the authors withheld from the reviewers. 
 
 Before final submission, you are expected to make sure that your paper complies with the following requirements. Please do not violate these requirements with the aim of including additional material: ​submissions that violate the formatting requirements may not be reviewed​.  You can visually inspect a page-by-page report of your paper format using the same tool as the submission system via a separate ​ online form  . After the submission deadline, we will use the same tool to check the conformance of papers. The format checking tool uses heuristics and can make mistakes. The PC chairs will manually inspect and possibly reject those papers with evident format violations. However, no paper will be rejected due to format violations without being manually checked. 
 
 Any papers that do not adhere to the following guidelines may be immediately rejected:

 Konferenzbeitrag      NN2SQL: Let SQL Think for Neural Networks  ( BTW 2023,  2023  ) Schüle, Maximilian Emanuel  ;   Kemper, Alfons  ;   Neumann, Thomas      mehr...      Although database systems perform well in data access and manipulation, their relational model hinders data scientists from formulating machine learning algorithms in SQL. Nevertheless, we argue that modern database systems perform well for machine learning algorithms expressed in relational algebra. To overcome the barrier of the relational model, this paper shows how to transform data into a relational representation for training neural networks in SQL: We first describe building blocks for data transformation in SQL. Then, we compare an implementation for model training using array data types to the one using a relational representation in SQL-92 only. The evaluation proves the suitability of modern database systems for matrix algebra, although specialised array data types perform better than matrices in relational representation.    mehr...

  Konferenzbeitrag      WannaDB: Ad-hoc SQL Queries over Text Collections  ( BTW 2023,  2023  ) Hättasch, Benjamin  ;   Bodensohn, Jan-Micha  ;   Vogel, Liane  ;   Urban, Matthias  ;   Binnig, Carsten      mehr...      n this paper, we propose a new system called WannaDB that allows users to interactively perform structured explorations of text collections in an ad-hoc manner. Extracting structured data from text is a classical problem where a plenitude of approaches and even industry-scale systems already exists. However, these approaches lack in the ability to support the ad-hoc exploration of texts using structured queries. The main idea of WannaDB is to include user interaction to support ad-hoc SQL queries over text collections using a new two-phased approach. First, a superset of information nuggets from the texts is extracted using existing extractors such as named entity recognizers. Then, the extractions are interactively matched to a structured table definition as requested by the user based on embeddings. In our evaluation, we show that WannaDB is thus able to extract structured data from a broad range of (real-world) text collections in high quality without the need to design extraction pipelines upfront.    mehr... 
  Konferenzbeitrag      Witness Generation for JSON Schema Patterns  ( BTW 2023,  2023  ) Köhnen, Christoph      mehr...      JSON Schema is a schema language for the popular data exchange format JSON. This paper introduces an approach to convert regular expressions, which appear in ECMA-262 syntax in JSON Schema, into an alternative syntax such that they may be compiled to finite-state automata.This is a step towards generating witnesses, i.e., JSON instances which are valid w.r.t. the given JSON Schema specification. Specifically, we address the challenge that the ECMA-262 pattern syntax uses anchor symbols to mark the beginning and end of a word, which is not compatible with available libraries for automata manipulation. We implement an algorithm proposed by Dominik Freydenberger to convert regular expressions into brics syntax. We show that we successfully address over 97% of the patterns found in a collection of thousands of JSON Schema specifications collected from GitHub.    mehr... 
  Konferenzbeitrag      Efficient handling of recursive relationships in ORM frameworks using Entity Framework Core as an example  ( BTW 2023,  2023  ) Killisch, Benjamin Uwe      mehr...      ORM frameworks are a popular method to bridge the differences between object-oriented programming and relational data management. At the same time, recursive relationships are present in many schemas to represent tree-like or net-like structures. This paper discusses how to efficiently build and execute queries for data with recursive relationships in ORM frameworks. Five possible solutions are conceived and then implemented in Entity Framework Core (EF Core), while making sure that they can be used like regular LINQ queries. Next, the solutions are tested with different SQL dialects. The results of these tests are then analyzed by a variety of test parameters. This analysis shows that queries with recursive common table expressions and queries using key loading are the most efficient. Queries with auxiliary property, vertical unrolling or horizontal unrolling are either too slow or only usable under particular circumstances. The analysis also shows that the performance of the solutions is always dependent on the circumstances, especially the SQL dialect.    mehr... 
  Konferenzbeitrag      Explainable Data Matching: Selecting Representative Pairs with Active Learning Pair-Selection Strategies  ( BTW 2023,  2023  ) Laskowski, Lukas  ;   Sold, Florian      mehr...      In both research and enterprise, dirty data poses numerous challenges. Many data cleaning pipelines include a data deduplication step that detects and removes entries within a given dataset which refer to the same real-world entity. Throughout the development of such deduplication techniques, data scientists have to make sense of the large result sets that their matching solutions generate to quickly identify changes in behavior or to discover opportunities for improvements. We propose an approach that aims to select a small subset of pairs from the result set of a data matching solution which is representative of the matching solution’s overall behavior. To evaluate our approach, we show that the performance of a matching solution trained on pairs selected according to our strategy outperforms a randomly selected subset of pairs.    mehr... 
  Konferenzbeitrag      Which Rules Entail this Fact? - An Efficient Approach Using RDBMSs  ( BTW 2023,  2023  ) Gutberlet, Tim  ;   Sauerbier, Janik      mehr...      In this paper, we focus on the problem of identifying all rules that entail a certain target fact given a knowledge graph and a set of previously learned rules. This problem is relevant in the context of link prediction and explainability. We propose an efficient approach using relational database technology including indexing, filtering and pre-computing methods. Our experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our approach and the effect of various optimizations on different datasets like YAGO3-10, WN18RR and FB15k-237 using rules learned by the bottom up rule learner AnyBURL.    mehr... 
  Konferenzbeitrag      WebTensor: Towards high-performance raster data analysis in the browser  ( BTW 2023,  2023  ) Naumann, Lucas Fabian      mehr...      We present WebTensor, a chunked tensor implementation for WebAssembly (Wasm) compiled from C++ and designed to efficiently analyze raster data directly in the browser. WebTensor allows loading (chunked) data from various backends, manipulating it by aggregations and forwarding computed results in a zero-copy manner to JavaScript so that they can be further processed or visualized. We demonstrate the performance advantages of WebTensor by benchmarking data access and aggregation operations, and compare it against a JavaScript version of Webtensor compiled from the same C++ code.    mehr... 
  Konferenzbeitrag      To Iterate Is Human, to Recurse Is Divine --- Mapping Iterative Python to Recursive SQL  ( BTW 2023,  2023  ) Fischer, Tim      mehr...      Writing complex algorithms and iterative computations in SQL is difficult at best, commonly leading to code that intermingles looping control flow with database access. This yields programs with control flow that rapidly hops in and out of the database, with each roundtrip incurring significant overhead. We present the ByePy compiler, which can compile entire Python functions directly to plain recursive SQL:1999 queries. By doing so, the compilation eliminates all but a single roundtrip, leading to runtime speedups of up to an order of magnitude.    mehr... 
  Konferenzbeitrag      Optimizing Query Processing in PostgreSQL Through Learned Optimizer Hints  ( BTW 2023,  2023  ) Thiessat, Jerome  ;   Woltmann, Lucas  ;   Hartmann, Claudio  ;   Habich, Dirk      mehr...      Query optimization in database systems is an important aspect and despite decades of research, it isstill far from being solved. Nowadays, query optimizers usually provide hints to be able to steer theoptimization on a query-by-query basis. However, setting the best-fitting hints is challenging. To tacklethat, we present a learning-based approach to predict the best-fitting hints for each incoming query. Inparticular, our learning approach is based on simple gradient boosting, where we learn one modelper query context for fine-grained predictions rather than a single global context-agnostic model asproposed in related work. We demonstrate the efficiency as well as effectiveness of our learning-basedapproach using the open-source database system PostgreSQL and show that our approach outperformsrelated work in that context.    mehr...

 SOFSEM Profile   
  SOFSEM maintains a unique position among the annual conferences and symposia in computing. Through its invited talks and the selected contributed papers on current research, as well as its well-known familiar atmosphere, SOFSEM is an appreciable mix of an international symposium and a winter school. It is a proven format, combining the presentation of original, high-quality research papers with lectures on trending themes in foundations and their, often interdisciplinary, background. SOFSEM conferences are conducted in person. Traditionally housing all participants at the same  venue, the conference provides an optimal set-up for discussions, meetings, research initiatives, new contacts, and social interactions. SOFSEM encourages the co-operation and exchange of ideas among researchers across all domains of fundamental computer science and its bordering fields, in all stages of their career. It makes SOFSEM especially attractive for young computer scientists.  
 SOFSEM focuses on novel research and current developments in all key areas in fundamental computer science and its interfaces to the foundations of artificial intelligence ( algorithms, AI-inspired methods, computational complexity, formal models  ). SOFSEM's list of topics of interest was renewed in 2022 and evolves with the developments and trends in foundational research in computing with each edition of the conference.   
 Awards   
 Each year the SOFSEM Program Committee determines which of the contributed papers is/are deservant of the Best Student Paper Award  and the Best Paper Award  of the conference.   Best Paper and Best Student Paper Awards 2024: see | SOFSEM 2024 | .

  SOFSEM conferences can be organized in any European country. The location of SOFSEM x+2  is normally decided at the business meeting of SOFSEM x+1  , in January or February of year x  +1. Proposals for organizing SOFSEM x+2  are welcomed any time during year x  , well ahead of this business meeting. If you/your team is interested in organizing the next SOFSEM, please get in touch with the Steering Committee.  Guidelines for proposing to organize a SOFSEM conference: | pdf | . 
  There are separate guidelines for PC chairs and organizers of a SOFSEM conference ( pdf  , or contact the steering committee). The organizers of the SOFSEM in a given year decide whether they wish to allow for e.g. exhibitions of literature (books, journals), meetings or presentations of national or international research projects, or other special activities. Interested parties should contact the organizing committee for further details. Code of Conduct  
 SOFSEM is committed to providing a safe and welcoming conference environment, where ideas can be expressed and exchanged openly and freely, where the rights and dignity of every person and group are respected, and where principles of diversity and inclusion are embraced throughout.

  Brief History of SOFSEM  
  SOFSEM ( orig.  SOFtware SEMinar) was founded in 1974 as a winter seminar for computer scientists and software engineers in former Czechoslovakia. SOFSEM soon became the foremost national seminar devoted to theoretical and practical problems of software systems. In fact, in these early days of computer science and technology, SOFSEM supplemented the university education and academic research by facilitating a fast transfer of the latest relevant knowledge in computing to its audience. Later on international experts were invited also, to present series of lectures on recent topics. Each SOFSEM consisted of several series of invited lectures of 3 to 5 hours, complemented by selected contributions of participants. Until 1994, the total duration of every SOFSEM was two weeks. Gradually, SOFSEM transformed from a mainly national seminar into an international conference. After the split of Czechoslovakia in 1993 SOFSEM continued, but now alternating between the Czech and Slovak Republics. SOFSEM became recognized for its high-level invited talks and well-chosen tracks that followed the trends in the field. From 1995 onward, the SOFSEM proceedings were included in the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science of Springer. The duration of SOFSEM was shortened to eight days, and the track areas became more and more fixed for a longer time. Over the years, as the field expanded and international collaborations flourished, SOFSEM's unique role within the Czech and Slovak computer science communities lessened, yet its significance and position as an international symposium grew.  
 In 2016 the SOFSEM Steering Committee decided that, from then on, SOFSEM conferences could be organized by colleagues anywhere in Europe, i.e. not limited to the Czech or Slovak Republics anymore. The duration of SOFSEM was limited to a week or four days but its format and focus were still left unchanged, with three separate tracks (foundations, software engineering, and data science and engineering), a special theme track (algorithmic computational biology), and a student research forum. In 2022 SOFSEM did not take place, due to the covid-19 pandemic, but the time was used to prepare SOFSEM for the next major step on its new course, namely focusing the conference fully and undividedly to the foundations of computer science, together with its interfaces to closely related areas, especially the computational principles of artificial intelligence and data science.

 The Young Student Fellow Program and the P.O. Pistilli Scholarship now accepting submissions    
   
 SAN FRANCISCO, CA – March 23, 2021 – The Design Automation Conference (DAC)  has been dedicated for 58 years to fostering a vibrant, worldwide community of electronic design and systems professionals, as well as improving the diversity among attendees. DAC’s student fellow and scholarship programs are designed to give students their first experience with the electronic design and systems industry. The 58 th  DAC is being planned as a hybrid event, part online, part face-to-face, with the live event taking place at Moscone West Center in San Francisco, CA from December 5-9, 2021. DAC will co-locate with SEMICON West 2021  , which is being held December 7-9 at Moscone North and South halls.  
 Young Student Fellow Program:   
 The Young Student Fellow Program  sponsored by DAC, Cadence Academic Network and Synopsys, actively supports the next engineering generation by enabling young students at the beginning of a career to enter the dynamic world of design and automation of electronic systems. Each Young Student Fellow will engage at DAC through numerous events such as technical sessions, participation in student-related events at DAC, and a poster session designed to introduce each Young Student Fellow to the DAC community.  
 Over the past ten years, since the inception of this scholarship, several hundreds of students have enrolled in the program, while enjoying time attending DAC. The program was held virtually in 2020 and attended by over 400 students globally. The Young Student Fellows program will be held virtually again this year. Each selected Fellow will receive a free DAC full conference registration including tutorials. The awardees will participate in the following activities during the conference:  
 Design Automation Summer School with interesting presentations. 
  Special professional development program with career coaching and interview skill training. 
  Present a poster on the work they are doing and present this during a special DAC Poster session. 
  Prepare a short video on a research paper they attended at DAC. This can be any paper presented at DAC, other than one’s own or ones from the Fellow’s institution. 
  Exclusive events with major prizes. 
  Preference is given to junior or senior undergraduates in engineering, to under-represented demographics such as women and minorities, to students in smaller research groups and to students pursuing a master’s degree and or Ph.D.  
 To apply for a Young Student Fellowship, students must complete the application form.  The submission site is open now through October 1, 2021. Qualifying students will be notified by November 1, 2021. Conference participation will be held virtual December 2021.

 OK_1 Opening Keynote 1: Building the Metaverse: Augmented Reality applications and integrated circuit challenges   
 Start   
 Mon, 09:00    
   
 Edith Beigné, Meta Reality Labs, United States   

 Abstract   
 Augmented reality is a set of technologies that will fundamentally change the way we interact with our environment. It represents a merging of the physical and the digital worlds into a rich, context aware and accessible user interface delivered through a socially acceptable form factor such as eyeglasses. One of the biggest challenges in realizing a comprehensive AR experience are the performance and form factor requiring new custom silicon. Innovations are mandatory to manage power consumption constraints and ensure both adequate battery life and a physically comfortable thermal envelope. This presentation reviews Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality applications and Silicon challenges.

 OK_2 Opening Keynote 2: The Cyber-Physical Metaverse – Where Digital Twins and Humans Come Together   
 Start   
 Mon, 09:45    
   
 Dirk Elias, Robert Bosch GmbH, Germany   

 Abstract   
 The concept of Digital Twins (DTs) has been discussed intensively for the past couple of years. Today we have instances of digital twins that range from static descriptions of manufacturing data and material properties to live interfaces to operational data of cyber physical systems and the functions and services they provide.  
 Currently, there are no standardized interfaces to aggregate atomic DTs (e.g., the twin of the lowest-level function of a machine) to higher-level DTs providing more complex services in the virtual world. Additionally, there is no existing infrastructure to reliably link the DTs in the virtual world to the integrated CPSs in the real world (like a car consisting of many ECUs with even more functions).  
 This keynote will address how the Metaverse can become the virtual world where DTs of humans and machines live and how to reliably connect DTs to the physical world. Insights in current activities of Bosch Research and its academic partners to move towards this vision will be provided.

 LK_1 IEEE CEDA Distinguished Lecturer Lunchtime Keynote: Restoring the magic in design   
 Start   
 Mon, 13:00    
   
 Jan M. Rabaey, University of California at Berkeley, United States and imec, Belgium   

 Abstract   
 The emergence of “Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI)” in the late 1970’s created a groundswell of feverish innovation. Inspired by the vision laid out in Mead and Conway’s “Introduction to VLSI Design”, numerous researchers embarked on venues to unleash the capabilities offered by integrated circuit technology. The introduction of design rules, separating manufacturing from design, combined with an intermediate abstraction language (CIF) and a silicon brokerage service (MOSIS) gave access to silicon for a large population of eager designers. The magic however expanded way beyond these circuit enthusiasts and attracted a whole generation of software experts to help automate the design process, given rise to concepts such as layout generation, logic synthesis, and silicon compilation. It is hard to overestimate the impact that this revolution has had on information technology and society at large.  
 About fifty years later, Integrated Circuits are everywhere. Yet, the process of creating these amazing devices feels somewhat tired. CMOS scaling, the engine behind the evolution in complexity over all these decades, is slowing down and will most likely peter out in about a decade. So has innovation in design tools and methodologies. As a consequence, the lure of IC design and design tool development has faded, causing a talent shortage worldwide. Yet, at the same time, this moment of transition offers a world of opportunity and excitement. Novel technologies and devices, integrated in three-dimensional artifacts are emerging and are opening the door for truly transformational applications such as brain-machine interfaces and swarms of nanobots. Machine learning, artificial intelligence, optical and quantum computing present novel models of computation surpassing the instruction-set processor paradigm. With this comes a need again to re-invent the design process, explicitly exploiting the capabilities offered by this next generation of computing systems. In summary, it is time to put the magic in design again.

 LK_2 Special Day Lunchtime Keynote: Interacting with Socially Interactive Agent   
 Start   
 Tue, 13:00    
   
 Catherine Pelachaud, CNRS-ISIR, Sorbonne Université, France   

 Abstract   
 Our research work focuses on modeling Socially Interactive Agents, i.e. agents capable of interacting socially with human partners, of communicating verbally and non-verbally, of showing emotions. but also of adapting their behaviors to favor the engagement of their partners during the interaction. As partner of an interaction, SIA should be able to adapt its multimodal behaviors and conversational strategies to optimize the engagement of its human interlocutors. We have developed models to equip these agents with these communicative and social abilities. In this talk, I will present the works we have been conducted.

 LK_3 Special Day Lunchtime Keynote: Analyze the Patient, engineer the therapy   
 Start   
 Wed, 13:00    
   
 Liesbet Lagae, KU Leuven, Belgium   

 Abstract   
 The complexity, cycle time and cost of new precision therapy workflow are a major challenge to overcome in order to achieve clinical implementation of this revolutionary type of treatments. For example, car T cells use the patient’s own immune (T-)cell adapted in a way to better fight cancer. Chip technology can help to make these therapies more efficient, precise, and cost-effective. Over the last few decades, the semiconductor industry has grown exponentially, poised to increase value to the end-user while driving down costs by scaling. The result is the world’s highest standard in precision and high-volume production of nanoelectronics chip-based sensor solutions. Imec has used its semiconductor process expertise and infrastructure to make significant innovations in single-use silicon biochip and microfluidic technology, creating toolboxes of on-chip functions spanning DNA sequencing, cell sorting, single cell electroporation, integrated biosensor arrays. The solutions have until now mostly served the diagnostic market. Chip based microfluidics is a toolbox that brings its own design challenges, especially in relation to not having to reinvent the wheel every time. Hence, we try to make maximal reuse of generic fluidic building blocks developed for the diagnostic market, and we will explain how these building blocks are equally adapted for addressing the challenges in immune therapy. These existing demonstrations on chip could enable to provide smarter solutions for discrete unit operations and quality monitoring to even complete workflow integration. Solving these challenges would enable more patients to access and benefit from the next most anticipated class of life changing therapies.

 The ACM SIGCHI Conference on Designing Interactive Systems (DIS) is the premier international arena where designers, artists, psychologists, user experience researchers, systems engineers, and many more, come together to debate and shape the future of interactive systems design and practice. DIS is ranked 12th in HCI on Google Scholar  and a Tier A publication venue  , partly due to an average acceptance rate of 25%  over the years.  
 Note from the Chairs  
 We are delighted that DIS 2023 will return to in-person conference programming and will be hosted by Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA  . For those who cannot attend in person, there will be opportunities to present online and engage with conference goers.  
 After three years of online programming, Pittsburgh is an ideal city to host our return to in-person conference experiences. Pittsburgh has a long history of reinvention, revival, and resilience. Once the largest steel producing region in the world, it is now a booming hub for AI, automation, creativity, and culture. Pittsburgh has reinvented itself through investments in education, health care, technology and advanced manufacturing alongside huge investments into cultural institutions such as the Carnegie Museum of Art  and the Andy Warhol Museum  . Additionally, Carnegie Mellon – the host institution — stands at the intersection of technology, design, art, creativity, and innovation. The city offers an excellent backdrop for discussions around technology, design and art.  
 With the return to an in-person conference, we are also excited that many tracks, formats, and experiences that have been missing from DIS during the pandemic will return. This year, we’ll reintroduce demos, works in progress, and an arts exhibition to make place in the program to showcase emerging ideas, processes, and expressions. Two days of workshops  will also precede the main three-day conference. This — along with the reintroduction of panels and evening events — we hope will create rich space for conversation, provocation, and debate about the design, research and practice for interactive systems.  
 We are looking forward to seeing you in Pittsburgh in Summer 2023,  
 Nik and Daragh  
 DIS 2023 Theme: Resilience   
 “Everything is chaos and always becoming, The only thing that we know is that it will always change.”  
 In recent years, we have been forcefully reminded of the importance of resilient design and resilient systems. Between pandemics, changing climates, and local and global upheavals, events have led many in the design world to reconsider how robust the things we are designing really are and how robust they could be. Despite recognition of how important resilience is to society, systems, and interactions, achieving this in practice requires many new and alternative ways of thinking and rethinking, knowing and unknowing, making and unmaking.  
 Resilience is at once about flexibility, durability, and strength as well as a sense of mutuality and hope where solidaristic modes of engagement make new kinds of worlds possible.  
 This also recognizes that resilience takes many forms in design discourse, ranging across: indigenous knowledge, more-than-human perspectives, and the relationship between human, material and artificial intelligences. For example, resilience in products asks what endures and invites examination of adaptability, as well as material concerns towards sustainability. Similarly, resilience in systems requires us to consider both recovering from breakdowns, as well as the harm, abuse, exploitation, and bias that can exist in systems today.  
 Many questions remain unanswered. How do we deal with designing in an uncertain world? When do we design for and when do we design with things breaking down and wearing out? How do we design for systems that end? How do we design systems that change over time? When do we, and when should we  , rebuild things that aren’t resilient?  
 With these questions in mind, we encourage submissions that critique, resist, and/or reimagine taken-for-granted forms of resilience in interactive design research and practices, as well as those that present creative and provocative interactive systems to extend how we think about design.

 The Conference  
 The conference addresses all aspects of research into technologies for electronic and (embedded) systems engineering. It covers the design process, test and tools for design automation of electronic products ranging from integrated circuits to distributed large-scale systems. This includes both hardware and embedded software design issues. The conference scope also includes the elaboration of design requirements and new architectures for challenging application fields such as sustainable computing, smart societies and digital wellness, secure systems, autonomous systems and smart industry, and state of the art applications of artificial intelligence. Engineers, scientists and researchers involved in innovative industrial designs are particularly encouraged to submit papers to foster feedback from design to research.  
  Special Days on Emerging Topics  
 The scientific research track is complemented by a set of sessions focussing on emerging topics bringing new challenges to the community, with presentations and interactions on interesting and timely issues.  
 Special Day "New Trends in AI/ML"  
 This Special Day will focus in exploring the latest trends and innovations in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). AI (and mainly generative AI) is booming since the release of chat-GPT and it will change the future of Design, Automation and Test. This Special Day will highlight the following topics:  
 Design of hardware architectures, including automatic exploration of large design spaces, assistance of the human designer, resource selection and optimisation 
  Verification of hardware architectures, with topics such as performance prediction, (formal) design validation, accelerating simulations thanks to AI-Augmented Surrogate Models 
  AI-Accelerated Physical Design and Validation of layout and floorplans 
  Sustainability in AI/ML Development. 
  During the talks, AI/ML techniques such as Neural architecture search (NAS), Generative adversarial networks (GAN), Reinforcement learning, hybridisation of classical and AI techniques, federation of Small Language Models (or agents) will be discussed.  
 These topics will be presented by a lineup of distinguished speakers who are expert in their respective fields. The day will conclude with a panel discussion allowing exchanges with the audience and trigger discussions on the interaction between the various domains presented during the day.  
 This event is ideal for AI/ML researchers, data scientists, hardware designers, software developers, sustainability advocates, and anyone interested in the future directions of AI and ML for Design, Automation and Test.

  Special Day "Emerging Computing Paradigms"  
 -formerly "Unconventional Computing"-   
  Sustaining increasingly challenging compute workloads requires going beyond technology scaling with von Neumann architectures in traditional CMOS. Examples include NP-hard optimisation, massive sensor processing in IoT, as well as deep learning and artificial intelligence where training compute requirements grow by ~750x every two years. Therefore, rethinking computing toward more sustainable and efficient solutions is urgently needed. This can take place by bringing computation closer to its physical substrate, or by seeking new computing paradigms across all layers of the compute stack, thereby spanning architecture, circuit, and device solutions.  
 The Special Day on Emerging Computing Paradigms covers key emerging topics in the areas of quantum computing, neuromorphic engineering, physics-based computing, probabilistic computing, reversible and adiabatic computing, and cellular automata. Starting with talks by key experts and closing with a panel discussion, this Special Day aims to outline tradeoffs and synergies in the wide landscape of unconventional computing approaches.

  Special Initiative “Autonomous Systems Design”  
 Fueled by the progress of Artificial Intelligence, autonomous systems are increasingly becoming integral parts of many Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) applications, such as automated driving, robotics, avionics, industrial automation and smart systems in general. Autonomous systems are self-governed and self-adaptive systems that are designed to operate in an open and evolving environment, which is not completely defined at design time. This poses a unique challenge to the design and verification of dependable autonomous systems. The DATE Special Initiative on Autonomous Systems Design will include peer-reviewed papers, special sessions and interactive sessions addressing these challenges.

  Unplugged Sessions on Unconventional Computing  
 Come join us for stimulating brainstorm discussions in small groups about the future of digital engineering. Our focus this year will be on Unconventional Computing. Unconventional computing is computing by any of a wide range of new or unusual methods. Examples are analogue mechanical, analogue electrical, biological, membrane, optical, fluidics, micromechanical, etc. computing. In this session we will on the one hand look into different examples of unconventional computing and will subsequently explore the commonalities and foundations of these approaches. Abstraction and analogy seem to always be at the heart of unconventional computing approaches. Furthermore, the value (performance, cost, energy consumption) of these approaches seems to lie in their restriction to a particular class of problems. (Electrical) analogue computing for example excels at solving differential equations. We will try to chart the boundaries of operation where value is created.  
 We consider quantum computing to be outside the scope of the unplugged session.  
 If you want to get involved in the discussions, please contact the chairs accordingly.

To support it, submissions must not include authors' names. In addition, prior work by the same authors should be referenced in full and it should be discussed in such a way that it does not disclose that the work is from the same authors. Any submission that is not in line with the above rules will be discarded. Accepted papers not complying to the above-mentioned formatting instructions will not be included in the conference proceedings. A detailed description of the IEEE authorship guidelines and responsibilities is available here ( https://www.ieee.org/publications/rights/author-rights-responsibilities…  ).  
 All papers will be evaluated with regard to their suitability for the conference, originality and technical soundness. The programme committee reserves the right to reorient a submission to an extended abstract.  
 Submissions simultaneously under review or accepted by another conference, symposium, or journal will be rejected. Submissions for which pre-prints are available (e.g., on  arXiv   ) are allowed, BUT these pre-prints may only be published after authors are notified of whether their manuscript is accepted or not. The authors are expected to follow all reasonable efforts to ensure that the submission is compliant with the double-blind review process.   
 Scientific Papers  
 DATE seeks submissions of original, unpublished scientific work  in one of its four tracks (D, A, T, and E) and 33 topics; for track and topic list, see Tracks and Topics list  .

  Camera-Ready and Presentation  
 Authors of accepted papers will prepare the camera-ready version of the paper, adhering to the IEEE proceedings format and will be checked through PDFeXpress. A recorded video presentation of the paper is also required, according to guidelines that will be made available. It should be noted that accepted Late Breaking Results papers will be published as submitted and are expected to be camera-ready, i.e., no separate camera-ready submission will be possible.  
 Registration Rule for All Accepted Papers  
 Please note that each paper shall be accompanied by at least one full conference registration at the paper author rate (i.e., two paper author registrations are needed for two accepted papers, e.g., from the main author or a co-author of the paper). DATE is a physically held conference, and not a hybrid conference.  Therefore, it is mandatory that at least one author of each accepted paper attends the session where the paper is discussed and presents the work as requested, otherwise the paper will be deleted from the proceedings afterwards (despite full payment at the paper author rate).  
  Focus Sessions  
 Focus Sessions can take the form of (1) Panels, discussing visionary and controversial issues or (2) Hot-Topic Sessions, focusing on the introduction and discussion of new R&D problems, addressing trends in the technical domains that are of interest to the conference participants.  
 Focus Session proposals must consist of an extended summary of up to 1,500 words in a PDF file, describing the topic, the authors/speakers and the format and must be submitted at https://softconf.com/date25/focus-session/  by Friday, 11 October 2024 AoE  . The submitter of a Focus Session proposal will be notified of acceptance or rejection of his/her proposal by Tuesday, 19 November 2024 AoE  . In case of acceptance, contributors of accepted Focus Sessions will be asked to submit final texts or statements of panellists, as appropriate, for publication in the proceedings as final, camera-ready manuscripts by Friday, 17 January 2025 AoE  . Panel sessions are entitled to one (1) page per panellist in the proceedings; Hot-Topic Sessions are allocated a maximum of six (6) pages paper per speaker or one single paper for the entire session which should not exceed ten (10) pages. As a rule of thumb, no more than four speakers per session should be planned for Hot-Topic Sessions. For the accepted Focus Sessions, it is the responsibility of the Focus Session organiser(s) to ensure that the Friday, 17 January 2025 AoE  deadline is met and all the camera-ready manuscripts from their respective Focus Sessions are technically sound and meet the editorial standards of the DATE proceedings. The Focus Session Co-Chairs may decline the publication of the final manuscripts in the DATE proceedings if the above responsibility is not fulfilled. Accepted or invited speakers to the Focus Sessions will be required to register for the conference.  
 Further Instructions for Focus Session Submissions   
 In addition to the above-stated important instructions, e.g. w.r.t. author list and double submissions, please adhere to the following:  
 Session Chair/Co-Chair  : Every special session submission must name a chair and a co-chair; the chair and the co-chair are responsible for the preparation of the session and for the monitoring of the session; they cannot be selected among the moderators/panelists, or speakers/presenters.

 Researching the future of gaming  
 The Exertion Games Lab researches the future of play and games in order to understand how to design better interactive experiences, in particular we focus on games that put the human body in the centre of the experience. We draw from interaction design, sports, psychology, human-computer interaction (HCI) and embodiment thinking to contribute to human-player interaction.  
     
 We are always looking for excellent PhD, Master and undergraduate students as well as interns, if interested please get in contact.

  How customer reviews and ratings work   Customer Reviews, including Product Star Ratings, help customers to learn more about the product and decide whether it is the right product for them.  
 To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyses reviews to verify trustworthiness.

 International Conference on Developments in eSystems Engineering  

 Developments of eSystems Engineering (DeSE) has been established in recognition of the escalating importance and relevance of electronic media, applications and devices in our everyday work, home and commercial environments. These systems have often arisen as solutions to domain specific problems, addressing areas of social science, business studies, engineering, auto, health studies, computer science, communications, geo-systems and most other academic and vocational subject areas. Accordingly developments and innovations in e-systems engineering have appeared through sources appropriate to their subject area with little heed paid to the actual underlying science of engineering an e-system. Therefore, it is the intention of DeSE to provide the increasingly essential forum dedicated to discussing and reporting on developments in the field of e-systems engineering; including all relevant research and practical advancements.  
 The areas of interest will, by the nature of the subject, be very wide: The science behind e-systems engineering will be advanced through the integrated approach of specifically considering e-systems development with the added advantage of transferable experience and knowledge across all individual subject areas. As the technology advances and users become more familiar with e-systems the impact of these systems is likely to be felt in many areas:  
 In education there is vast scope for the introduction of advanced eLearning  tools allowing students/pupils an improved level of independent learning. 
  E-systems are often based on or are required to exhibit some form of Artificial Intelligence  (AI). AI techniques based on paradigms such as neural nets or expert systems will thus be relevant to and impact upon research into e-systems development. 
  In eBusiness  there is already a significant uptake of eSystems  by eCommerce  websites, which can only increase in future years with developments in ePayment  systems and newly developed models of commerce. Issues of trust, security and database design are typically studied within this area. 
  eServices  are becoming an important part of Web based computing with Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) and Software as a Service (SaS) seen as the future of computing. 
  We are proud to announce that the Applied Computing in Medicine and Health, 1st Edition is available to pre-order via the Elsevier Store from the link below.  
 http://store.elsevier.com/product.jsp?isbn=9780128034682   
  
 The authors of the book chapters are international researchers based in the UK and abroad from both academia and practitioners from medical institutions. The book can be used as teaching materials for undergraduate and postgraduate degree students, for students studying for a Computer Science Degree, Software Engineering and Health Informatics related subjects. Additionally, researchers can use the book as reference for their research and development in the field of AI and Health.

 27th International Conference on Developments in Language Theory  
  Umeå, Sweden  
  June 12-16, 2023  
  https://dltwords2023.cs.umu.se/index.php/dlt   
 The International Conference on Developments in Language Theory (DLT 2023) is an event organized to bring together members of the academic, research, and industrial community who have an interest in formal languages, automata theory, and related areas (see possible topics below). The conference will be held in conjunction with the 14th International Conference on Words (WORDS 2023) in Umeå, Sweden, one week before midsummer. Hence, for those attending it may be a good opportunity to extend their stay in northern Sweden by a week.  
 During the conference, one or more prizes for the best student papers  (sponsored by MDPI) will be awarded.  
 Important Dates  

 Deadline for abstract  submission:  February 19, 2023  
  Deadline for paper  submission:  February 26, 2023  
  Notification:  April 1, 2023  
  Final Version:  April 10, 2023  
  DLT 2023:  June 12-16, 2023  
 Deadlines are strict  and will not be extended!  
 Submission Guidelines  
 Authors are invited to submit papers presenting original and unpublished research. The proceedings will be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) Series. Simultaneous submission to journals or other conferences with published proceedings is not allowed. Submitted papers should not exceed 12 pages excluding bibliography and must follow the LNCS-style LaTeX2e (available at http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html  ).  
 In order to facilitate the review process, all proofs omitted due to page limitations can be given in an appendix or made accessible through a reliable link to a freely available electronic preprint. Please note that the paper should be self-contained; reviewers are not required to read any additional pages, thus consulting the appendix is up to the reviewer. Papers should be submitted electronically in PDF through the EasyChair system:  
 https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dlt2023    
 All questions about submissions should be emailed to drewes@cs.umu.se  .

  DLT Award  
 A special DLT award was given to professors Arto Salomaa and Grzegorz Rozenberg during the 20th DLT symposium in Montreal in 2016. The award was given due to their distinguished contributions to automata theory and founding the DLT conference. The award consisted of a DLT Award diploma and an artistic glass work of an owl.  

  Salomaa Prize  
 As a continuation of the DLT Award, an annual prize, named as Salomaa Prize  , was created in 2018. The first prize was awarded in the DLT symposium in Tokyo in 2018. The prize consists of a diploma and 2000 euros prize funded by the University of Turku, the home university of Arto Salomaa. The selection of the winner is decided by an international prize committee  which is appointed by the steering committee of DLT. There is an open call for nominations  .

 LIMITS AND MARGINS OF GAMES  

 welcome  
  to digra  
  seville 2023  

 The 2023 DiGRA International Conference  is an initiative of the Digital Games Research Association  , an academic organisation formally established in 2003 in Finland.  

 This new edition will take place on 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 June 2023 in Seville, Spain  , under the theme Limits and Margins of Games  .  

 The organizing committee of the DiGRA 2023 conference is particularly interested in exploring the limits and margins of games.  
 The video game taxon seems insufficient today to describe the theoretical and practical nature linked to this means of expression.  
 The negotiation of limits and margins, and their evaluation over time, constitutes the necessary re-centering operation that modern game studies have been developing since their birth in the late 1990s.  
 However, everything suggests that at this moment we stand at a crossroads: the entering of VR as a significant agent, the exponential growth of independent proposals, the strengthening of digital industries as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic… are facts that impact on the old general agreements about the medium, significantly altering its theoretical roadmap.  
 As a result of these concerns, and with the aim of building an international framework for a dialogue about them, we proposed the Limits and Margins of Games as the central theme to this year’s edition.  
 We hope to be able to offer you an experience on a par with previous editions and a unique meeting point in the south of Europe.  
 Welcome to DiGRA 2023!

 About Our Conferences  
 Our conferences gather several hundred people to share, talk, and debate about games and play – just like any scientists do at their conferences but possibly with a little bit more of fun. Our very first conference ‘Level Up’ was organised over 20 years ago at Utrecht University in the Netherlands by Joost Raessens, Marinka Copier, Jeffrey Goldstein, and Frans Mäyrä. Our future, meanwhile, is up to you! Around once a year, you can find a new call for conference hosts in our news section  . We are always on the lookout for research groups to bid us their location!  

 Our Next Conference  
 DiGRA 2025 – “Games at the Crossroads”  
 June 30th – July 4 th    
 Valletta, Malta   
 The theme of the conference will be Games at the Crossroads, exploring games and game studies at points of (cultural, disciplinary) encounter and divergence.

 Download   Self-Supervised Disentanglement of Harmonic and Rhythmic Features in Music Audio Signals   Yiming Wu    
   
 DAFx-2023 - Copenhagen    
 The aim of latent variable disentanglement is to infer the multiple informative latent representations that lie behind a data generation process and is a key factor in controllable data generation. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network-based self-supervised learning method to infer the disentangled rhythmic and harmonic representations behind music audio generation. We train a variational autoencoder that generates an audio mel-spectrogram from two latent features representing the rhythmic and harmonic content. In the training phase, the variational autoencoder is trained to reconstruct the input mel-spectrogram given its pitch-shifted version. At each forward computation in the training phase, a vector rotation operation is applied to one of the latent features, assuming that the dimensions of the feature vectors are related to pitch intervals. Therefore, in the trained variational autoencoder, the rotated latent feature represents the pitch-related information of the mel-spectrogram, and the unrotated latent feature represents the pitch-invariant information, i.e., the rhythmic content. The proposed method was evaluated using a predictor-based disentanglement metric on the learned features. Furthermore, we demonstrate its application to the automatic generation of music remixes.

 Download   Decorrelation for Immersive Audio Applications and Sound Effects   Sascha Disch    
   
 DAFx-2023 - Copenhagen    
 Audio decorrelation is a fundamental building block for immersive audio applications. It has applications in parametric spatial audio coding, audio upmix, audio sound effects and audio rendering for virtual or augmented reality applications. In this paper, we provide insights into the practical design considerations of an audio decorrelator on the example of the decorrelator contained within the upcoming MPEG-I Immersive Audio ISO standard [1]. We describe the desirable properties of such a decorrelator, common approaches for implementation and our particular technology choices for the decorrelator used in MPEG-I for rendering sound sources with homogeneous extent.

 Download   Feature Based Delay Line Using Real-Time Concatenative Synthesis   Niccolo Abate  ; Brian Hansen    
   
 DAFx-2023 - Copenhagen    
 In this paper we introduce a novel approach utilizing real-time concatenative synthesis to produce a Feature-Based Delay Line (FBDL). Expanding upon the concept of a traditional delay, its most basic function is familiar – a dry signal is copied to an audio buffer whose read position is time shifted producing a delayed or "wet" signal that is then remixed with the dry. In our implementation, however, the traditionally unaltered wet signal is modified such that the audio delay buffer is segmented and concatenated according to specific audio features. Specifically, the input audio is analyzed and segmented as it is written to the delay buffer, where delayed segments are matched to a target feature set, such that the most similar segments are selected to constitute the wet signal of the delay. Targeting methods, either manual or automated, can be used to explore the feature space of the delay line buffer based on dry signal feature information and relevant targeting parameters, such as delay time. This paper will outline our process, detailing important requirements such as targeting and considerations for feature extraction and concatenation synthesis, as well as discussing use cases, performance evaluation, and commentary on the potential of advances to digital delay lines.

 Download   A frequency tracker based on a Kalman filter update of a single parameter adaptive notch filter   Randall Ali  ; Toon van Waterschoot    
   
 DAFx-2023 - Copenhagen    
 In designing a frequency tracker, the goal is to follow the continual time variation of the frequency from a particular sinusoidal component in a noisy signal with a high accuracy and a low sample delay. Although there exists a plethora of frequency trackers in the literature, in this paper, we focus on the particular class of frequency trackers that are built upon an adaptive notch filter (ANF), i.e. a constrained bi-quadratic infinite impulse response filter, where only a single parameter needs to be estimated. As opposed to using the conventional least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm, we present an alternative approach for the estimation of this parameter, which ultimately corresponds to the frequency to be tracked. Specifically, we reformulate the ANF in terms of a state-space model, where the state contains the unknown parameter and can be subsequently updated using a Kalman filter. We also demonstrate that such an approach is equivalent to doing a normalized LMS filter update, where the regularization parameter can be expressed as the ratio of the variance of the measurement noise to the variance of the prediction error. Through an evaluation with both simulated and realistic data, it is shown that in comparison to the LMS-updated frequency tracker, the proposed Kalmanupdated alternative, results in a more accurate performance, with a faster convergence rate, while maintaining a low computational complexity and the ability to be updated on a sample-by-sample basis.

 Due to advances in computational power, physical modelling for sound synthesis has gained an increased popularity over the past decades. Although much work has been done to accurately simulate existing physical systems, much less work exists on the use of physical modelling simply for the sake of creating sonically interesting sounds. This work presents a mass-spring network, inspired by existing models of the physical string. Masses have 2 translational degrees of freedom (DoF), and the springs have an additional equilibrium separation term, which together result in highly nonlinear effects. The main aim of this work is to create sonically interesting sounds while retaining some of the natural qualities of the physical string, as opposed to accurately simulating it. Although the implementation exhibits chaotic behaviour for certain choices of parameters, the presented system can create sonically interesting timbres, including nonlinear pitch glides and ‘wobbles’.

 Download   Probabilistic Reverberation Model Based on Echo Density and Kurtosis   Champ Darabundit  ; Jonathan Abel  ; Wieslaw Woszczyk    
   
 DAFx-2023 - Copenhagen    
 This article proposes a probabilistic model for synthesizing room impulse responses (RIRs) for use in convolution artificial reverberators. The proposed method is based on the concept of echo density. Echo density is a measure of the number of echoes per second in an impulse response and is a demonstrated perceptual metric of artificial reverberation quality. As echo density is related to the statistical measure of kurtosis, this article demonstrates that the statistics of an RIR can be modeled using a probabilistic mixture model. A mixture model designed specifically for modeling RIRs is proposed. The proposed method is useful for statistically replicating RIRs of a measured environment, thereby synthesizing new independent observations of an acoustic space. A perceptual pilot study is carried out to evaluate the fidelity of the replication process in monophonic and stereo artificial reverberators.

 Download   Fully Conditioned and Low-Latency Black-Box Modeling of Analog Compression   Riccardo Simionato  ; Stefano Fasciani    
   
 DAFx-2023 - Copenhagen    
 Neural networks have been found suitable for virtual analog modeling applications. Several analog audio effects have been successfully modeled with deep learning techniques, using low-latency and conditioned architectures suitable for real-world applications. Challenges remain with effects presenting more complex responses, such as nonlinear and time-varying input-output relationships. This paper proposes a deep-learning model for the analog compression effect. The architecture we introduce is fully conditioned by the device control parameters and it works on small audio segments, allowing low-latency real-time implementations. The architecture is used to model the CL 1B analog optical compressor, showing an overall high accuracy and ability to capture the different attack and release compression profiles. The proposed architecture’ ability to model audio compression behaviors is also verified using datasets from other compressors. Limitations remain with heavy compression scenarios determined by the conditioning parameters.

 DAFx-2023 - Copenhagen    
 Head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) describe filters that model the scattering effect of the human body on sound waves. In their discrete-time form, they are used in acoustic simulations for virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR), and since HRTFs are listener-specific, the use of individualized HRTFs allows achieving more realistic perceptual results. One way to produce individualized HRTFs is by estimating the sound field around the subjects’ 3D representations (meshes) via numerical simulations, which compute discrete complex pressure values in the frequency domain in regular frequency steps. Despite the advances in the area, the computational resources required for this process are still considerably high and increase with frequency. The goal of this paper is to tackle the high computational cost associated with this task by sampling the frequency domain using hybrid linear-logarithmic frequency resolution. The results attained in simulations performed using 23 real 3D meshes suggest that the proposed strategy is able to reduce the computational cost while still providing remarkably low spectral distortion, even in simulations that require as little as 11.2% of the original total processing time.

 Download   A Differentiable Digital Moog Filter For Machine Learning Applications   Etienne Gerat  ; Purbaditya Bhattacharya  ; Udo Zoelzer    
   
 DAFx-2023 - Copenhagen    
 In this project, a digital ladder filter has been investigated and expanded. This structure is a simplified digital analog model of the well known analog Moog ladder filter. The goal of this paper is to derive the differentiation expressions of this filter with respect to its control parameters in order to integrate it in machine learning systems. The derivation of the backpropagation method is described in this work, it can be generalized to a Moog filter or a similar filter having any number of stages. Subsequently, the example of an adaptive Moog filter is provided. Finally, a machine learning application example is shown where the filter is integrated in a deep learning framework.

 Download   A Quadric Surface Model of Vacuum Tubes for Virtual Analog Applications   Riccardo Giampiccolo  ; Stefano D'Angelo  ; Alberto Bernardini  ; Augusto Sarti    
   
 DAFx-2023 - Copenhagen    
 Despite the prevalence of modern audio technology, vacuum tube amplifiers continue to play a vital role in the music industry. For this reason, over the years, many different digital techniques have been introduced for accomplishing their emulation. In this paper, we propose a novel quadric surface model for tube simulations able to overcome the Cardarilli model in terms of efficiency whilst retaining comparable accuracy when grid current is negligible. After showing the model capability to well outline tubes starting from measurement data, we perform an efficiency comparison by implementing the considered tube models as nonlinear 3-port elements in the Wave Digital domain. We do this by taking into account the typical common-cathode gain stage employed in vacuum tube guitar amplifiers. The proposed model turns out to be characterized by a speedup of 4.6× with respect to the Cardarilli model, proving thus to be promising for real-time Virtual Analog applications.

Top  
 Biomolecular computing has emerged as an interdisciplinary field that draws together molecular biology, chemistry, computer science and mathematics. Our knowledge on DNA nanotechnology and biomolecular computing increases exponentially with every passing year. The annual international meeting in the field began in 1995 right after the landmark work by L. Adleman, who solved an instance of the Hamiltonian path problem by DNA molecules and opened the door to this new field. Since then, the meeting has been a forum where scientists with different backgrounds, yet sharing a common interest in biomolecular computing meet, and present their latest results.  
 The annual meeting was called International Meeting on DNA Based Computers   till 2003 (DNA9), and from 2004 (DNA10) it is called International Meeting on DNA Computing.   From 2009 (DNA15), the meeting is called International Conference on DNA Computing and Molecular Programming.

 Dynamic Languages Symposium (DLS)  
  The Dynamic Languages Symposium (DLS) is a forum for discussion of dynamic languages, their implementation and application. While mature dynamic languages including Smalltalk, Lisp, Scheme, Self, Prolog, and APL continue to grow and inspire new converts, a new generation of dynamic scripting languages such as JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Tcl Lua, and Clojure are successful in a wide range of applications. DLS provides a place for researchers and practitioners to come together and share their knowledge, experience, and ideas for future research and development.

  Title: Cast Insertion Strategies for Gradually-Typed Objects 
  Conference: DLS 2013 
  Paper: | https://doi.org/10.1145/2508168.2508171 
  Citation: This paper explored the costs, both at micro and macro scale of various strategies for protecting gradual types in a gradually-typed programming language, examining how different strategies affected untyped typed, or both components of code. It is a seminal contribution to understanding the performance of gradual typing, which since then has been an area of important research. The strategies used in gradually-typed languages today can trace their lineage back to the strategies described and proposed in this paper. In particular, the proposed hybrid approach has been adapted time and time again by many systems, giving this work a lasting impact beyond its original scope.

  Title: Self-optimizing AST interpreters 
  Conference: DLS 2012 
  Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2384577.2384587 
  Citation: Over the past decade, the authors and their collaborators have taken the ideas from this paper and turned it into the Truffle and GraalVM system which has revolutionized how we implement languages on the JVM. Today, the GraalVM is a major product and Truffle is a language implementation technology producing high-performance implementations of everything from Ruby to C all built upon the ideas of AST rewriting in the interpreter.

  Title: Bootstrapping a Self-Hosted Research Virtual Machine for JavaScript: An Experience Report 
  Conference: DLS 2011 
  Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2047849.2047858 
  Citation: The 2011 DLS paper “Bootstrapping a Self-Hosted Research Virtual Machine for JavaScript: An Experience Report” is a great overview and source of ideas for virtual machine development. It represents a comprehensive guide to design choices to make in the space and for that it is still notable today. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2020 for 2010 | Recipients: Tom Van Cutsem and Mark S. Miller 
  Title: Design Principles for Robust Object-oriented Intercession APIs 
  Conference: DLS 2010 
  Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1869631.1869638 
  Citation: The 2010 DLS paper “Proxies: Design Principles for Robust Object-oriented Intercession APIs” is a prime example of the object-capability model. In short order, it managed to bridge the gap from research to become an integral part of an important language today. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2019 for 2009 | Recipients: Alexander Yermolovich, Christian Wimmer, and Michael Franz 
  Title: Optimization of Dynamic Languages Using Hierarchical Layering of Virtual Machines 
  Conference: DLS 2009 
  Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1408688 
  Citation: This 2009 DLS paper is an important early paper in the area of meta virtual machines. It showed a simple and effective approach to VM construction that was simultaneously explored by multiple research groups at the time and which has since found further applications. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2018 for 2008 | Recipients: Jeremy G. Siek and Manish Vachharajani 
  Title: Gradual Typing With Unification-based Inference 
  Conference: DLS 2008 
  Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1408681.1408688 
  Citation: The 2008 DLS paper “Gradual Typing With Unification-based Inference” showed that one can increase the static guarantees made in a program through an ingenious combination of gradual typing and unification-base type inference. The ideas underlying this paper have found their way into the design of many modern programming languages, and have had a strong impact on the research community. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2017 for 2007 | Recipients: Stijn Mostinckx, Tom Van Cutsem, Stijn Timbermont, and Éric Tanter 
  Title: Mirages–Behavioral Intercession in a Mirror-based Architecture 
  Conference: DLS 2007 
  Paper: | http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1297095 
  Citation: The 2007 DLS paper “Mirages: Behavioral Intercession in a Mirror-based Architecture” combined the ideas of explicit mirrors for reflective introspection and modification with implicit mirrors for behavioral intercession. The work in this paper influenced and inspired the design of proxies in the JavaScript language, where it now has applications in areas such as security, testing, and virtualization of the DOM. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2016 for 2006 | Recipients: Armin Rigo and Samuele Pedroni 
  Title: PyPy’s Approach to Virtual Machine Construction 
  Conference: DLS 2006 
  Paper: | http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1176753 
  Citation: The 2006 DLS paper “PyPy’s Approach to Virtual Machine Construction” introduced the PyPy Python interpreter and the RPython framework. Both are still highly relevant in various areas to this day and will continue to be influential for many years, thus demonstrating highly impressive long-term vision and impact. The paper laid the theoretical and practical foundations of constructing a virtual machine from a high-level description and was consequently built upon by numerous follow-up publications. The software, which continues to be developed by a large and active open source community proved extensively usable in multiple academic and industrial contexts. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2015 for 2005 | Recipients: Pascal Costanza and Robert Hirschfeld 
  Title: Language Constructs for Context-oriented Programming–An Overview of ContextL 
  Conference: DLS 2005 
  Paper: | http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1146842 
  Citation: The 2005 DLS paper “Language Constructs for Context-oriented Programming: An Overview of ContextL” introduced a framework that enables programmers to modify the behavior of a program based on the context in which it is used, without requiring changes to the original program. This paper triggered a cascade of research on Context-oriented Programming and spawned a community with its own international workshop series, which is still going strong today.

 Call for Contributions  
  
 The Dynamic Languages Symposium (DLS) is the premier forum for researchers and practitioners to share research and experience on all aspects on dynamic languages.  
 After two decades of dynamic language research and DLS, it is time to reflect and look forward to what the next two decades will bring. This year’s DLS will therefore be a special DLS focusing on the Future of Dynamic Languages. To do the notion of “symposium” justice, we will actively invite speakers to present their opinions on where Dynamic Languages might be, will be, or should be going in the next twenty years.  
 Speakers will be announced step by step over the coming weeks.  
 As a research venue, we also invite high quality papers reporting original research and experience related to the design, implementation, and applications of dynamic languages. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 innovative language features 
  innovative implementation techniques 
  innovative applications 
  development environments and tools 
  experience reports and case studies 
  domain-oriented programming 
  late binding, dynamic composition, and run-time adaptation 
  reflection and metaprogramming 
  software evolution 
  language symbiosis and multi-paradigm languages 
  dynamic optimization 
  interpretation 
  just-in-time and ahead-of-time compilation 
  soft/optional/gradual typing 
  hardware support 
  educational approaches and perspectives 
  semantics of dynamic languages 
  frameworks and languages for the Cloud and the IoT 
  Submission Details   
 Submissions must neither be previously published nor under review at other events. DLS 2023 uses a lightweight double-blind reviewing process.  
 Papers are assumed to be in one of the following categories:  
 Research Papers  : describe work that advances the current state of the art  
 Experience Papers  : describe insights gained from substantive practical applications that should be of a broad interest  
 Dynamic Pearls  : describe a known idea in an appealing way to remind the community and capture a reader’s interest  
 The program committee will evaluate each paper based on its relevance, significance, clarity, and originality. The paper category needs to be indicated during submission, and papers are judged accordingly.  
 Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format. Submissions must be in the ACM SIGPLAN conference acmart format, 10 point font, and should not exceed 12 pages. Please see full details in the Instructions for Authors.  
 DLS 2023 will run a single-phase reviewing process with shepherding to help authors make their final papers the best that they can be. Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library (TBC) and will be freely available for one month, starting two weeks before the event.

 First Call for Papers  
 EDM 2023: the 16th International Conference on Educational Data Mining  
 Bangalore, India, July 11-14, 2023   
 Shareable Call for Papers  (pdf)    

 Submit paper here     

 Important Note   
  Compared to previous years, EDM 2023 will have an earlier submission deadline on Jan 20, 2023  (with Jan 13, 2023 as abstract submission deadline).  

 Theme: Educational data mining for amplifying human potential  
 Educational Data Mining is a leading international forum for high-quality research that mines datasets to answer educational research questions, including exploring how people learn and how they teach. These data may originate from a variety of learning contexts, including learning and information management systems, interactive learning environments, intelligent tutoring systems, educational games, and data-rich learning activities. Educational data mining considers a wide variety of types of data, including but not limited to log files, student-produced artifacts, discourse, learning content and context, sensor data, and multi-resource and multimodal streams. The overarching goal of the Educational Data Mining research community is to support learners and teachers more effectively, by developing data-driven understandings of the learning and teaching processes in a wide variety of contexts and for diverse learners.  
 The 16th iteration of the conference, EDM 2023, will take place in the Indian Institute of Science Campus, Bengaluru, India, during July 11-14, 2023.  
 The theme of this year’s conference is “ Educational data mining for amplifying human potential  ”. Not all students receive the education necessary to help them express their full potential be it due to a lack of resources or access to high quality teaching. The lack of high-quality educational material and teaching aids and methodologies and non-availability of objective feedback on how they can become even better teachers, deprive our teachers from achieving their full potential. The administrators and policy makers lack tools for making optimal decisions such as optimal class sizes and composition and course sequencing. These in turn handicap the nations, particularly the economically emergent ones, who recognize the centrality of education for their growth. Thus, EDM-2023 particularly welcomes papers focusing on concepts, principles, and techniques mined from educational data for enhancing the potential of all the stakeholders in the education system. Papers describing applications and case studies are especially welcome.

About  Steering Committee  Workshops  Work    
  
 About EMAS  
 The workshop on Engineering Multi-Agent Systems  was formed as a merger of three existing workshops:  
 Agent Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) 
  Declarative Agent Languages and Technologies (DALT) 
  Programming Multiagent Systems (ProMAS) 
  EMAS was founded in 2012 at the Dagstuhl  seminar “Engineering Multi-Agent Systems”  , which most of the Steering Committee members of the three former workshops were attending.  
 Steering Committee  
 EMAS was originally overseen by a merged steering committee from the three parent  workshops, which then expanded:

 Important Notice  
 The direct submission link   is available. Authors will use the same link to submit the abstract first, then the full paper. For abstract submissions, there is no need to upload a pdf paper. Authors will have until the submission date to submit the full manuscript. Once a submission has been made, the same submission can be revised until the paper deadline by going to the author console. After the abstract submission deadline, the form will change and some fields will become mandatory.  
 The ARR commitment link   is available.  
 Overview  
 The 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2023) invites the submission of long and short papers on substantial, original, and unpublished research on empirical methods for Natural Language Processing. As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be for papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and Computational Linguistics (CL) journals.  
  EMNLP 2023 will follow EMNLP 2022 and ACL 2023 and go with a hybrid format with respect to ARR. This means that while EMNLP will accept ARR-reviewed papers  , it will also accept submissions directly to EMNLP through the OpenReview system.   
 However, in order to keep the review load on the community as a whole manageable, we need to ask authors to decide up-front if they want to be reviewed through ARR or EMNLP.   
 Review Process:  
 Papers submitted directly to EMNLP will have the “regular” review process: paper reviewed by 3 reviewers, authors are invited to write an author response and revise their paper before the camera ready deadline, if accepted. ARR papers committed to EMNLP will be handled by the Senior Area Chairs. For these papers, the authors may provide an author response but not revise their paper (with the exception of adding the required “limitations” section, if it was missing from the ARR submission; see below).  
 Open Papers/Reviews/Metareviews/Rebuttal via OpenReview Platform  
 This year, some of the reviews, author responses and meta reviews will be made publicly available. Our motivation is to provide increased transparency in the review process, to foster more accountability for reviewers and higher quality reviews as well as enabling peer review research by providing an open collection of papers and reviews. We will follow a process where only reviews, author responses and meta reviews of accepted papers and opt-in rejected papers  (where opting in is done by authors) will be made publicly available after the acceptance notifications  . We will use the OpenReview platform, which is also currently used by the ACL Rolling Review as well as other related conferences and is well suited to this type of process.  
 Cross Submission Policy with ARR  
 Any ARR-reviewed paper that got all of its reviews and meta-reviews available by the ARR-to-conference commitment deadline (August 22, 2023), can be committed to EMNLP 2023. | Notes: | The manuscript submission from ARR that is committed to EMNLP | cannot | be modified (with the exception of adding the required “limitations” section, if it was missing from the ARR submission), but the authors can add an author response that will be seen by the EMNLP programme committee. 
  EMNLP will consider any ARR paper that has been fully reviewed by the August 22 2023 commitment deadline. The regular ARR timeline suggests that ARR submissions should be made by June 15th. Consequently, care must be taken in deciding whether a submission should be made to ARR or EMNLP directly if the work has not been submitted anywhere before the call. Plan accordingly. 
  The OpenReview system | deadline | for direct submission papers, namely non-ARR submission papers, is June 23, 2023. 
  Papers submitted to ARR before May 27, 2023, can be withdrawn and submitted to EMNLP 2023. | Notes | : | In order for a paper to be submitted directly to EMNLP 2023, it must be inactive in the ARR system. This means that the submission must either be explicitly withdrawn by the authors, or the ARR reviews are finished and shared with the authors before May 27, and the paper was not re-submitted to ARR. 
  The authors can withdraw from ARR by May 27, 2023, regardless of how many reviews they have received. 
  Papers that are in the ARR system after May 27, 2023, either submitted after or submitted before and not withdrawn, cannot be submitted to EMNLP 2023. 
  Papers submitted to EMNLP 2023 may not be submitted for review elsewhere (including ARR) while being under review at EMNLP 2023.

 Mandatory abstract submission  
 The paper title, author names, contact details, and a brief abstract must be submitted electronically through the EMNLP 2023 paper submission site by the abstract submission deadline (June 16). It will be possible to make minor edits to the title and abstract until the full paper submission deadline, but you cannot change authors and  subject areas. As this is the first time the main conference is using OpenReview as platform, which requires to create an account prior to submission, we will exceptionally allow modifications to the list of authors between the abstract deadline and the paper submission deadline. No further changes to the author list will be allowed after the paper submission deadline.  Submissions with “placeholder” abstracts will be removed without consideration;  
 Important  : if you miss the abstract submission deadline, then you cannot submit the full paper.

  Paper Submission Information  
 Paper Submission and Templates  
 Submission is electronic, using the OpenReview conference management system. Both long and short papers must follow the EMNLP 2023 two-column format, using the supplied official style files. The templates can be downloaded in Style Files and Formatting. Please do not modify these style files, nor should you use templates designed for other conferences. Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review.  
 Verification  
 To guarantee conformance to publication standards, we will be using the ACL Pubcheck tool (https://github.com/acl-org/aclpubcheck). The PDFs of camera-ready papers must be run through this tool prior to their final submission, and we recommend its use also at submission time.  
 Long Papers  
 Long paper submissions must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included. Review forms will be made available prior to the deadlines. Long papers may consist of up to 8 pages of content, plus unlimited pages for references and appendix; final versions of long papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages) so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account.  
 Short Papers  
 Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead short papers should have a point that can be made in a few pages.  
 Short papers may consist of up to 4 pages of content, plus unlimited references and appendix. Upon acceptance, short papers will be given 5 content pages in the proceedings. Authors are encouraged to use this additional page to address reviewers’ comments in their final versions.  
 Contributions  
 EMNLP 2023 welcomes the following kinds of contributions:  
 Computationally-aided linguistic analysis (of either models or data resources) 
  NLP engineering experiment 
  Reproduction study 
  New data resources, particularly for low-resource languages 
  Approaches for data- and compute efficiency 
  Position papers 
  Surveys 
  Publicly available software and pre-trained models 
  While there is no direct mapping between types of contributions and paper length, some kinds of papers naturally gravitate towards a certain length: e.g. surveys are more likely to be long rather than short papers. One paper can make more than one contribution of different types.  
 Presentation Mode  
 Long and short papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. The decisions as to which papers will be presented orally and which as poster presentations will be based on the nature rather than the quality of the work. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally and as posters.  
 Authorship  
 The author list for submissions should include all (and only) individuals who made substantial contributions to the work presented. Each author listed on a submission to EMNLP 2023 will be notified of submissions, revisions and the final decision. No changes to the order or composition of authorship may be made to submissions to EMNLP 2023 after the abstract submission deadline.  
 Citation and Comparison  
 You are expected to cite all refereed publications relevant to your submission, but you may be excused for not knowing about all unpublished work (especially work that has been recently posted and/or is not widely cited). While not citing such unpublished works upon submission is not sufficient grounds for paper rejection, you are expected to cite such relevant work in camera ready, if notified about it by reviewers.  
 In cases where a preprint has been superseded by a refereed publication, the refereed publication should be cited instead of the preprint version. Papers (whether refereed or not) appearing less than 3 months before the submission deadline are considered contemporaneous to your submission, and you are therefore not obliged to make detailed comparisons that require additional experimentation and/or in-depth analysis. However, you are expected to mention such works in your submission, and list their published results if they are directly relevant.  
 For more information, see the ACL Policies for Submission, Review, and Citation  .  
 Multiple Submission Policy  
 EMNLP 2023 will not consider any paper that is under review in a journal or another conference at the time of submission, and submitted papers must not be submitted elsewhere during the EMNLP 2023 review period. This policy covers all refereed and archival conferences and workshops (e.g., NeurIPS, ACL workshops), as well as ARR. In addition, we will not consider any paper that overlaps significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. Authors submitting more than one paper to EMNLP 2023 must ensure that their submissions do not overlap significantly (>25%) with each other in content or results.  
 EMNLP 2023 will also accept submissions of ARR-reviewed papers, provided that the ARR reviews and meta-reviews are available by the ARR-to-conference submission deadline. However, EMNLP 2023 will not accept direct submissions that are actively under review in ARR, or that overlap significantly (>25%) with such submissions.  
 Optional: Sticky Reviews  
 The papers previously reviewed at other *ACL  venues (but not through ARR) have the option to submit the paper together with information about their previous submission, from which the track chairs will be able to access the old reviews. They will also be able to submit a short (~ 1 page) explanation of how the paper was changed in response to the old reviews. This option could be beneficial for the authors who have addressed the problems identified before, and can argue strongly for how the paper has been improved. The prior reviews will not be seen by the new reviewers, but they may be used by the area chairs, senior area chairs and program chairs in review quality control, resolving disagreements between reviewers, and in deciding borderline papers. All the information submitted should be anonymous.   
 Mandatory Discussion of Limitations  
 We believe that it is also important to discuss the limitations of your work, in addition to its strengths. EMNLP 2023 requires all papers to have a clear discussion of limitations, in a dedicated section titled “Limitations”. This section will appear at the end of the paper, after the discussion/conclusions section and before the references, and will not count towards the page limit. Papers without a limitation section will be automatically rejected without review.  
 ARR-reviewed paper that did not include “Limitations” section in their prior submission, should submit a PDF with such a section together with their EMNLP 2023 submission.  
 While we are open to different types of limitations, just mentioning that a set of results have been shown for English only probably does not reflect what we expect. Mentioning that the method works mostly for languages with limited morphology, like English, is a much better alternative. In addition, limitations such as low scalability to long text, the requirement of large GPU resources, or other things that inspire crucial further investigation are welcome.  
 Theme Track: Large Language Models and the Future of NLP  
 We are happy to announce that EMNLP 2023 will have a new theme with the goal of stimulating discussion around Large Language Models and the Future of NLP. While the new generation of Large Language Models such as GPTX, LLAMA, BLOOM etc. claim to perform at unprecedented levels for generation and understanding, we are in unexplored territory on many aspects of such LLMs, including performance on various NLP tasks and languages, data sovereignty, fairness, interpretability, ethics, transparency, NLP applications, etc.  
 The theme track invites empirical and theoretical research, as well as position and survey papers on the ways in which such LLMs perform on NLP tasks and applications, and what this means for the future of NLP as a field. The possible topics of discussion include (but are not limited to) the following:  
 How reliably do the current generation of LLMs perform on NLP tasks and applications? 
  How is linguistic diversity covered by these LLMs? 
  What are the different systemic failures of such LLMs and recovery strategies and methodologies? 
  Do these models enhance scientific understanding (of language, cognition, or deep learning technology)? In what ways? 
  What are the different ethical and FATE-related considerations regarding the design and use of such models? 
  What are the opportunities LLMs offer to NLP research ? 
  How do LLMs capture world knowledge? 
  How can we incorporate existing knowledge bases effectively into LLMs? 
  How can we evaluate the performance of such models intrinsically (with no downstream application involved) 
  How can such models influence how NLP research is done in the future? 
  How replicable is the performance of these models in both NLP research and real-life applications? 
  The theme track submissions can be either long or short. We anticipate having a special session on this theme at the conference and a Thematic Paper Award in addition to other categories of awards.  
 Ethics Policy  
 Authors are required to honor the ethical code set out in the ACL Code of Ethics  . The consideration of the ethical impact of our research, use of data, and potential applications of our work has always been an important consideration, and as artificial intelligence is becoming more mainstream, these issues are increasingly pertinent. We ask that all authors read the code, and ensure that their work is conformant to this code. Where a paper may raise ethical issues, we ask that you include in the paper an explicit discussion of these issues, which will be taken into account in the review process. We reserve the right to reject papers on ethical grounds, where the authors are judged to have operated counter to the code of ethics, or have inadequately addressed legitimate ethical concerns with their work.  
 Authors will be allowed extra space after the 8th page (4th for short papers) for an optional broader impact statement or other discussion of ethics. The EMNLP review form will include a section addressing these issues and papers flagged for ethical concerns by reviewers or ACs will be further reviewed by an ethics committee. Note that an ethical considerations section is not required, but papers working with sensitive data or on sensitive tasks that do not discuss these issues will not be accepted. Conversely, the mere inclusion of an ethical considerations section does not guarantee acceptance. In addition to acceptance or rejection, papers may receive a conditional acceptance recommendation. Camera-ready versions of papers designated as conditional accept will be re-reviewed by the ethics committee to determine whether the concerns have been adequately addressed. Please read the ethics FAQ  for more guidance on some problems to look out for and key concerns to consider relative to the code of ethics.  
 Optional Supplementary Materials  
 Appendices, Software and Data   
 Each EMNLP 2023 submission can be accompanied by an appendix, which will appear in the main paper’s PDF, after the bibliography. A submission may also be accompanied by one .tgz or .zip archive containing software, and one .tgz or .zip archive containing data. EMNLP 2023 encourages the submission of these supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results, and to enable authors to provide additional information that does not fit in the paper. For example, anonymised related work (see above), preprocessing decisions, model parameters, feature templates, lengthy proofs or derivations, pseudocode, sample system inputs/outputs, and other details that are necessary for the exact replication of the work described in the paper can be put into the appendix. However, the paper submissions need to remain fully self-contained, as these supplementary materials are completely optional, and reviewers are not even asked to review or download them. If the pseudo-code or derivations or model specifications are an important part of the contribution, or if they are important for the reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work, they should be a part of the main paper, and not appear in the appendix. Supplementary materials need to be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy.  
 Anonymity Period  
 The following rules and guidelines are meant to protect the integrity of double-blind review and ensure that submissions are reviewed fairly. The rules make reference to the anonymity period, which runs from 1 month before the submission deadline (starting May 23, 2023) up to the date when your paper is accepted or rejected (Oct 6, 2023). Papers that are withdrawn during this period will no longer be subject to these rules.  
 You | may not | make a non-anonymized version of your paper available online to the general community (for example, via a preprint server) during the anonymity period. Versions of the paper include papers having essentially the same scientific content but possibly differing in minor details (including title and structure) and/or in length. 
  If you have posted a non-anonymized version of your paper online before the start of the anonymity period, you may submit an anonymized version to the conference. The submitted version must not refer to the non-anonymized version, and you must inform the programme chairs that a non-anonymized version exists. 
  You may not update the non-anonymized version during the anonymity period, and we ask you not to advertise it on social media or take other actions that would further compromise double-blind reviewing during the anonymity period. 
  You may make an anonymized version of your paper available (for example, on OpenReview), even during the anonymity period. 
  For arXiv submissions, May 23, 2023 11:59pm UTC-12h (anywhere on earth) is the latest time the paper can be uploaded. 
  Instructions For Double-Blind Review  
 As reviewing will be double blind, papers must not include authors’ names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references or links (such as github) that reveal the author’s identity, e.g., “We previously showed (Smith, 1991) …” must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as “Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) …” Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review. Papers should not refer, for further detail, to documents that are not available to the reviewers. For example, do not omit or redact important citation information to preserve anonymity. Instead, use third person or named reference to this work, as described above (“Smith showed” rather than “we showed”). If important citations are not available to reviewers (e.g., awaiting publication), these paper/s should be anonymised and included in the appendix. They can then be referenced from the submission without compromising anonymity. Papers may be accompanied by a resource (software and/or data) described in the paper, but these resources should also be anonymized.  
 Reproducibility Criteria  
 Reviewers will be asked to assess the reproducibility of the work as part of their reviews. The following are the criteria that reviews will take under consideration.  
 For all reported experimental results:  
 A clear description of the mathematical setting, algorithm, and/or model 
  Submission of a zip file containing source code, with specification of all dependencies, including external libraries, or a link to such resources (while still anonymized) Description of computing infrastructure used 
  The average runtime for each model or algorithm (e.g., training, inference, etc.), or estimated energy cost 
  Number of parameters in each model 
  Corresponding validation performance for each reported test result 
  Explanation of evaluation metrics used, with links to code 
  For all experiments with hyperparameter search:  
 The exact number of training and evaluation runs 
  Bounds for each hyperparameter 
  Hyperparameter configurations for best-performing models 
  Number of hyperparameter search trials 
  The method of choosing hyperparameter values (e.g., uniform sampling, manual tuning, etc.) and the criterion used to select among them (e.g., accuracy) 
  Summary statistics of the results (e.g., mean, variance, error bars, etc.) 
  For all datasets used:  
 Relevant details such as languages, and number of examples and label distributions 
  Details of train/validation/test splits 
  Explanation of any data that were excluded, and all pre-processing steps 
  A zip file containing data or link to a downloadable version of the data 
  For new data collected, a complete description of the data collection process, such as instructions to annotators and methods for quality control. 
  This list is based on Dodge et al, 2019 and Joelle Pineau’s reproducibility checklist.  
 Presentation Requirement  
 All accepted papers must be presented at the conference—either on-line or in-person—in order to appear in the proceedings. Authors of papers accepted for presentation at EMNLP 2023 must notify the program chairs by the camera-ready deadline if they wish to withdraw the paper.  
 At least one author of each accepted paper must register for EMNLP 2023 by the early registration deadline.

  Title: Cast Insertion Strategies for Gradually-Typed Objects 
  Conference: DLS 2013 
  Paper: | https://doi.org/10.1145/2508168.2508171 
  Citation: This paper explored the costs, both at micro and macro scale of various strategies for protecting gradual types in a gradually-typed programming language, examining how different strategies affected untyped typed, or both components of code. It is a seminal contribution to understanding the performance of gradual typing, which since then has been an area of important research. The strategies used in gradually-typed languages today can trace their lineage back to the strategies described and proposed in this paper. In particular, the proposed hybrid approach has been adapted time and time again by many systems, giving this work a lasting impact beyond its original scope.

 It is our pleasure to welcome you to the 19th edition of the Dynamic Language Symposium (DLS 2023), co-located with SPLASH 2023 in Cascais, Portugal. After about two decades of dynamic language research and DLS, it is time to reflect and look forward to what the next two decades will bring. This year’s DLS is therefore a special one focusing on the Future of Dynamic Languages. To do the notion of symposium  justice, we invited speakers to present their opinions on where dynamic languages might be, will be, or should be in the next twenty years.  
 We have 11 invited takes covering a wide range of areas including how dynamic languages should change how they can be used at scale from the perspective of tooling and performance how to interact with other language ecosystems and new developments such as generative artificial intelligence.  
 We warmly thank the Program Committee, the SPLASH organization, the speakers, and, last but not least, the audience.

 Definition  
 :  Educational data mining (EDM) is a novel scientific area that focuses on developing and applying methods to analyze datasets generated within educational settings. This paper outlines the evolution, significance, and applications of EDM. With the increasing popularity of e-learning in web-based educational systems, EDM has expanded to include a variety of analytical methods and data sources. Some key methodologies addressed include classification, regression analysis, clustering techniques, association rule mining, and Natural Language Processing, among others. Additionally, this paper looks at how EDM can facilitate data-driven decision-making among other areas such as curriculum development and customization of learners’ experiences. It also touches on issues related to the challenges of the scientific field. Finally, some projections about EDM’s future trends are made, especially concerning its integration into AI technologies and development trends like augmented reality or virtual reality, which imply greater possibilities for changes than any other series witnessed before within this sphere.

 1. Evolution of EDM  
 Educational data mining is a fairly new discipline that aims to develop new techniques for examining datasets obtained from the educational environment and applying these techniques in order to shed new light on students and educational settings. Over the past decades, EDM has expanded significantly, reflecting its increasing significance in the field of education. Initially, it involved the use of data mining techniques on educational data to answer some important questions [ 1  ]. However, with e-learning growth along with web-based education systems emergence, EDM’s scope has expanded and now covers a wide range of data sources as well as methods [ 2  ]. Consequently, it has given rise to more advanced models and approaches for analyzing student behavior and learning outcomes [ 3  ].   
 The development of EDM is characterized by an interdisciplinary approach. It integrates machine learning techniques, didactics, and cognitive psychology, among others; thus, it facilitates a more holistic understanding [ 4  ]. This interdisciplinary nature has allowed EDM to address complex challenges, such as personalized learning and the predictive modeling of student performance. A key milestone in the development of EDM was the organization of the first educational data mining conference in 2008, which provided a platform for researchers to share information and developments in the field [ 5  ]. Since then, the number of conferences, publications, and related research has grown exponentially, highlighting the growing academic and practitioner interest in EDM.   
 New terms and subfields have emerged alongside EDM, such as learning analytics (LA), academic analytics, and big data in education, reflecting the increasing focus and application of data analytics in educational contexts [ 6  ]. While EDM is mainly concerned with technological challenges, LA focuses on data-driven decision-making from what is being taught and integrates social and pedagogical dimensions [ 7  ]. Academic Analytics (AcAn), on the other hand, focuses on the use of broader data with the aim of using it mainly for administrative and decision-making purposes. Finally, the use of big data, which is now available, allows for the integration of large amounts of data from gamification and virtual reality tools [ 8  ].   
  
 2. The Significance of EDM in Education  
 EDM is very important for modern educational systems, and it is also vital because it makes it possible for raw data to be transformed into actionable information. According to Refs. [ 9  , 10  ], there has been an increase in the volumes of educational data due to e-learning platforms and Internet-based education systems, leading to the creation of large databases. The volume complexities involved in this type of data make it impossible to gain any meaningful understanding via conventional means. By making use of cutting-edge tools, the process may be made easier, leading to improved precision besides increasing the speed at which analyses are performed, thus promoting more informed decision-making alongside strategic planning [ 11  ].   
 In an organizational context, EDM has revealed the knowledge hidden deep within their data. The importance of EDM in teachers’ understanding of students’ learning processes is very significant [ 3  ]. An example is the examination of students’ behavioral patterns in classrooms and how they interact with instructional materials. This develops more adaptive approaches to the learning process. A very important contribution is the prediction of students’ academic performance based on specific individual characteristics; prediction models that integrate academic, social, and educational data help teachers identify students who are likely to drop out early and provide them with immediate assistance, thus improving overall academic outcomes [ 7  ].   
 Another important contribution of EDM is its ability to provide support for data-driven decision-making. In this way, educational institutions can make informed decisions. Better decisions are expected to have an impact on the optimization of educational processes and student success [ 6  ]. This approach is not only limited to improving academic performance but also to improving the overall educational environment [ 12  ].   
 Furthermore, EDM provides teachers and academic authorities with feedback, which, in turn, supports improvements in curriculum design, methods, and resource allocation. These kinds of feedback loops lead to building an education system that effectively responds to the increasing demands of both students and teachers.   
 Further, the importance of EDM in promoting a tradition of constant enhancement within learning institutions is beyond any doubt. In terms of understanding educational processes in a more detailed manner, EDM helps find areas that are not efficient or effective and therefore provides specific remedy actions. This will lead to better education while making sure that resources are managed as efficiently as they can be. Consequently, this allows EDM to nurture a fairer and more proficient education system based on data rather than hunches or customs [ 1  ].   
 The tools provided by EDM enable teachers and schools to comprehend, anticipate, and enhance students’ education. This enables one to make use of data and transform it into decisions, thus leading to individualized, prosperous, and efficient schools. In times to come when education will be enriched using educational data, EDM will be an integral part.   
  
 3. EDM Literature Reviews  
 The scientific field has been reviewed in the literature several times. Few of these, however, provide systematic reviews of the entire scientific discipline. According to Papadogiannis [ 13  ], some important reviews have been conducted in previous decades, as listed in Table 1  . In the following years, literature reviews were published, and from the examination of which, conclusions can be drawn about the latest developments in the scientific field of EDM [ 13  , 14  ]. In order to present the methods, thematic categories, data, and applications of the EDM discipline in this introductory presentation, data from the two above recent literature reviews have been used [ 13  , 14  ].   
 The literature review of Ozyourt [ 22  ] shows an exponentially increasing trend of research on EDM. According to Romero and Ventura [ 23  ], more than 6000 articles have been published on learning analytics and more than 3000 on EDM, which shows the growing interest of researchers in educational data analysis [ 24  ]. The exponential increase in the number of articles published on EDM and LA is also evidenced by the data we extracted from the Crossref database. We searched for “education data mining” AND “learning analytics” in the time period 2000–2024 and exported the results in a spreadsheet. The results were then cleaned up, and those that were relevant to EDM. The exponential growth of articles as well as a decline in the number of articles during the COVID-19 crisis is shown in Figure 1  . In simpler terms, this trend shows that the quantity of EDM and LA research has been increasing at an exponential pace over time. Each year’s growth builds on the previous year’s studies at an accelerating rate, captured by the exponentiation of the constant 0.1646. This has resulted in the number of studies multiplying rapidly from year to year. The high R 2  value of 0.89 indicates that this exponential function fits the data extremely well, suggesting that this pace of expansion is likely to continue in the near future. This rapid growth reflects the increasing importance, acceptance, and application of data mining and analytics approaches in education. Even challenges such as the COVID-19 crisis have not been able to slow the long-term upward trend.   
  
 4. EDM Data and Tools  
 EDM uses different types and sources of data, including those collected for purposes of research or those obtained from e-learning management platforms as well as MIS systems. Traditionally, sources such as students’ attendance records, grades, and demographic details provide insight into educational developments [ 1  , 25  ]. The increasing use of electronic learning platforms has led to massive amounts of data produced by students while they interact with digital platforms. Learning management systems (LMS), massive open online courses (MOOCs), and intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) record learners’ actions during online courses, results achieved, etc. [ 23  ]. Such information is important for drawing conclusions about student participation and learning patterns.   
 New educational settings like virtual and augmented reality and gamification tools are some of the additional sources of data. These settings track pupil movements or activities, allowing for a new way of looking at how learners gain knowledge in modern learning environments. Educational data can be divided into three levels [ 13  ]:   
 Micro-level data in education are mainly generated through interactions between students and learning platforms, such as MOOCs, simulations, and games. This data can capture detailed learner actions and contexts, enabling real-time interventions like feedback or skill adjustment. It is validated through real-time observations or retrospective coding [ 23  , 24  ]. Common methodologies, including Bayesian Knowledge Tracing and Performance Factor Analysis, are used to assess students’ knowledge and predict outcomes [ 25  ]. 
  Meso-level data are mainly generated through student texts in platforms like LMS and social media. Natural Language Processing (NLP) helps examine students’ cognitive, social, behavioral, and emotional processes. It supports automated grading and feedback, improves course design, and enhances student participation, though challenges remain in tool reliability and contextual factors [ 16  ]. 
  Macro-level data are collected over longer periods and include demographics, course enrollments, and academic records. These data are primarily used for institutional decision-making, supporting early warning systems that identify at-risk students and guidance systems that recommend courses [ 26  , 27  ]. Macro-level data are also utilized for administrative analyses to assess curriculum effectiveness and patterns of student success or dropout [ 28  ]. 
    
 This hierarchical nature allows for analysis at multiple (micro, meso, and macro) levels, and overall can provide a comprehensive picture of the learning process [ 12  ]. The complexity and volume of educational data require sophisticated methods for cleansing and pre-processing them to produce reliable results [ 10  ]. While these diverse data sources are a wealth for analysts, they also present challenges in terms of pre-processing. Data must be collected, cleaned, and anonymized in a way that ensures privacy and accuracy.   
 The data utilized in EDM can be broadly categorized into several types, including demographic data, interaction data, performance data, and psychometric data. Each type serves a specific purpose in understanding and enhancing the educational process. The following is an attempt to group educational data based on their type [ 2  ]:   
 Demographic data refer to ways in which students are divided by the information about their backgrounds (e.g., their age, gender, socio–economic status, and educational history). Demographic data are generally used to uncover some regularities and interconnections between sociodemographic features and the academic success of students. For example, the researchers can decide to investigate how the poverty rate affects the availability of education resources or what role the demographic aspects have in the level of a student’s performance [ 29  ]. This piece of information is crucial for building personalized learning experiences that highlighting the connection between the students and educators. 
  Interaction data are data that students receive from their interactions with different educational technologies; for instance, learning management systems, online courses, and educational software [ 30  ]. These data contain specific information about how often, for how long, and in what style students interact with a digitized learning process. Interaction data are a crucial part of the understanding of how students actually interact with e-learning, which can thus be helpful in the design of more effective instructional materials and interventions [ 31  ]. Thus, from an LMS, clickstream data analysis is a powerful tool that can allow educators to figure out which study resources are important to students; hence, the right content delivery can be achieved. 
  Performance data are grades, scores, and other assessments that tell us how well a student performed. This class of data can determine the effects of the educational programs on students and look where the children need the most help [ 23  ]. Performance data can be collected from traditional assessments, such as exams and quizzes, as well as from more dynamic sources such as real-time analytics from online learning platforms [ 31  ]. The interpretation of student performance data calls for the provision of quality performance measures that will be used in decision-making and predicting the student’s achievement. 
  Psychometric data cover measuring students’ cognitive abilities, their personality traits, and their emotional states. This kind of data is typically gathered through questionnaires, psychological assessments, and observation studies [ 30  ]. Psychometric data forms a basis for understanding the latent variables that on the one hand make learning happen in the first place, e.g., motivation, self-efficacy, and stress levels [ 29  ]. Other than providing the data of psychology, the data of other educational types come from the researchers and make possible the buildup of models shown by the students and the processes of the training. 
    
 According to Choi [ 14  ], data used in the studies are mainly academic (including grades), behavioral, and demographic, among others. The frequencies of use of EDM data types are shown in Table 2  .   
 Today, there are a variety of tools available for conducting EDM research, including Rapidminer, Weka, SPSS, Knime, Orange, and Spark Lib, as well as programming languages such as R and Python. However, educators find it challenging to use these tools since it is tough to identify suitable methods and parameters. The lack of competence is to be expected given that most cases require specialist knowledge, with the exception being perhaps visualization. In addition, researchers can now access a wide range of open datasets online ( Table 3  ). Although these data sets address specific issues, they are extremely beneficial for researchers and those seeking to further their understanding of the sector.   
  
 5. EDM Methods  
 EDM relies on a range of techniques, tools, and methods. These techniques are basically DM techniques adapted to the specific characteristics of educational data. Below are the main methods used by researchers.   
 Classification is a supervised machine learning method that aims to predict Y  based on a set of explanatory variables X  . The target categorical variable Y  can take on one of c preset values. A predictive classification function g  classifies each X  into one of the defined classes. The overall objective, as with any supervised learning method, is to minimize the expected loss or risk through g  by leveraging labeled training data to learn patterns between X  and Y  . The expected loss or risk is given by: l  g    =  E  L  o  s  s  Y  ,  g  (  X  )         

 where Loss ( y  , y  ^      ) is some loss function that quantifies the impact of classifying a response y  = g  ( x  ). In case there is no loss for a correct classification and a unit loss for a misclassification, the optimal classifier is the following: g  x    =  a  r  g  m  a  x   P  Y  =  y    X  =  x  ]       

 There are many different classification algorithms. Some of the most commonly used in EDM are [ 22  ]:   
 ○  Decision tree is a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, each branch represents an outcome of that decision, and each leaf node represents a class label. The tree is constructed by recursively splitting the data based on the feature that best separates the classes at each step, usually using metrics like Gini index or information gain.   
  ○  The Naive Bayes classifier is based on Bayes’ Theorem and assumes that features are independent of each other (hence the term “naive”). Despite this unrealistic assumption, Naive Bayes works well in practice, especially for text classification tasks like spam detection.   
  ○  Support vector machines aim to find a hyperplane that best separates the data points of different classes in a high-dimensional space. SVMs are particularly effective when the data are linearly separable. In cases where the data are not linearly separable, SVM uses a kernel trick to transform the data into a higher dimension where separation is possible.   
  ○  The KNN algorithm is an instance-based learning method where the classification of a new data point is determined by the majority class among its K-Nearest Neighbors in the feature space. It relies on distance metrics like Euclidean distance to measure the similarity between data points.   
  ○  Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy. Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data, and the final prediction is made based on the majority vote of the individual trees. This approach helps mitigate the overfitting problem associated with single decision trees.   
  ○  Neural networks are inspired by the biological neural networks of the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process input features to make predictions. Deep learning models, which are a type of neural network with many hidden layers, have gained popularity for complex classification tasks like image recognition and Natural Language Processing.   
     
 Evaluating the performance of the models is crucial in data mining. Some common evaluation metrics of classification algorithms are as follows: (a) Accuracy, which is the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances; it is simple to compute but may not be appropriate when the data is imbalanced. (b) Precision and recall are also important, with precision measuring the proportion of true positives among all predicted positives, and recall measuring the proportion of true positives among all actual positives. (c) F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, provides a balanced measure that works well for imbalanced datasets. (d) The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, which plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate, and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) are used to summarize the model’s performance.   
 In the context of EDM, classification can be used to predict student performance levels, identify at-risk students, or categorize students according to their learning style [ 24  ]. Some common algorithms in this regard are decision trees, Random Forests, and support vector machines. Decision trees are popular because they are easier to interpret and extract rules, which help educators understand the factors influencing predictions [ 7  ]. Figure 2  presents a decision tree based on four levels of performance of secondary school students in Greece. The tree predicts the level of performance in the third grade, based on the first and second grade levels [ 21  ].   
 Classification is usually used more often than regression, mainly due to the ease of implementation of the algorithms and their satisfactory accuracy. The application rate of classification algorithms ranges from 26.2% to 48.7% [ 13  ]. The higher rate is reported by Choi [ 14  ], where 68.8% of the total number of studies reviewed used classification algorithms.   
 Common classification algorithms employed in EDM include decision trees, Random Forests, support vector machines (SVMs), Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Each algorithm offers unique strengths. Decision trees are favored for their interpretability, allowing educators and academic staff to understand the factors influencing predictions and extract actionable rules. SVMs are particularly effective for binary classifications like pass/fail predictions [ 13  ].   
 Regression is a basic technique in supervised learning used to model the relationship between dependent and independent variables to predict continuous variables. More specifically, regression tries to predict a variable y using a function g  ( x  ), where x  is an explanatory vector x  = [ x  1  , …, x p   ] ⊤. The optimal function g  * has to be learned from the training set by minimizing the training loss: 
  l  g    =  1   n     ∑  i  =  1   n    (  y   i    −  g  x   i      )   2           

 Some of the most frequent types of regression are as follows: (a) Linear regression, where the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is linear. In the simplest case, the relationship is estimated from a straight line with one explanatory variable. (b) Polynomial regression is a form of regression where the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is modeled as an nth-degree polynomial. (c) Logistic regression is used when the dependent variable is binary (0,1). (d) Ridge regression is a variation of linear regression that introduces a regularization term (penalty) to the loss function to prevent overfitting. (e) Lasso regression is similar to ridge regression but uses a different penalty (absolute value of coefficients). (f) Elastic Net regression combines the properties of both Ridge and Lasso regression. Common evaluation metrics include:   
 Mean Squared Error (MSE) calculates the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual value. 
    
 M  S  E  =  1   N     ×  ∑  i  =  1   n    (  y   i    −  y  ^    i    )   2           

 where y  is the actual value of the predicted variable and y  ^      is the estimation of y  form the model.   
 Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is the square root of MSE, providing error estimates in the same units as the target variable. 
  R  M  S  E  =  1   N     ×  ∑  i  =  1   n    (  y   i    −  y  ^    i    )   2            

 Mean Absolute Error (MAE) measures the average absolute differences between predicted and actual values, offering a more interpretable measure of error without penalizing large errors as severely as MSE. M  A  E  =  1   N     ∑  i  =  1   n    y   i    −  y  ^    i             

 R-squared (R 2  ) evaluates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that the model explains, with values closer to 1 indicating better model fit. R   2    =  1  −  ∑  i  =  1   n    (  y   i    −  y  ^    i    )   2       ∑  i  =  1   n    (  y   i    −  y  ¯    i    )   2              

 Additionally, Adjusted R-squared adjusts for the number of predictors in the model, providing a more accurate measurement when dealing with multiple independent variables. An example of a simple regression model is presented in Figure 3  .   
 Regression is used in educational data mining to predict outcomes such as student grades or time spent on assignments and more. Several types of regression algorithms are used, such as linear regression, which assumes a direct linear relationship between the input and output variables, and polynomial regression, which adjusts a polynomial curve to capture more complex relationships. The ridge regression adds a penalty term to reduce overfitting, particularly in cases of multilinearity, while support vector machine (SVM) regression adapts the support vector classification approach for continuous forecasting or logistic regression for binary outcomes [ 1  , 13  , 14  ].   
 In EDM studies, regression has been used in about 18.8% [ 14  ] of studies or even less [ 13  ]. Among the algorithms used, linear regression was the one that performed better than other regression types and also became the preferred choice. Cross-validation techniques such as 5-fold and 10-fold cross-validation were often used to validate the accuracy of the models [ 13  ].   
 Clustering—an unsupervised learning technique—classifies similar instances into groups without predetermined labels. Clustering techniques aim to minimize within-cluster variance by iteratively assigning data points to the nearest cluster center. Clustering methods can be broadly categorized into five types: Partitioning methods, such as K-means and K-medoids, aim to divide data into a predefined number of clusters. K-means assigns points to clusters based on their proximity to centroids, which are iteratively refined, while K-medoids are more robust for outliers. Hierarchical methods build a tree-like structure (dendrogram) of clusters through either agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down) processes. 
  Density-based methods, like DBSCAN, identify clusters by detecting dense regions in data and treating sparse points as noise. Model-based methods, such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), assume that data are generated from a mixture of probability distributions and seek to estimate the parameters that best fit the data. Finally, grid-based methods partition the data space into a grid of cells and perform clustering on these cells, providing an efficient solution for large datasets.   
 Some clustering evaluation metrics are as follows: (a) The Silhouette Score quantifies how well a data point is aligned with its own cluster relative to other clusters, with higher scores indicating better cluster cohesion and separation. (b) Intra-cluster and inter-cluster distances further complement this assessment by measuring the compactness of clusters and their separation from one another. (d) The Davies–Bouldin Index analyzes the relationship between within-cluster dispersion and inter-cluster separation, where lower values signify more effective clustering. (e) The Rand Index and its variant, the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), are used to compare the agreement between predicted clusters and actual labels, if available, by evaluating the accuracy of pairwise point assignments.   
 In EDM, clustering has been applied to identify student groups with similar learning behaviors or performance levels, enabling personalized learning interventions. Some of the algorithms widely used to perform clustering are K-means, C-means, and hierarchical clustering methods [ 13  , 31  ].   
 Clustering allows teachers to classify students into performance-based groups, such as high-achieving or at-risk students, based on engagement or other academic data [ 28  ]. In this way, grouping helps to personalize learning and adopt measures specific to each group of students. Despite its utility, clustering remains underutilized in EDM, appearing in only 4.2% of analyzed studies or less [ 13  , 14  ]. An interesting example is the use of the X-means algorithm to group Greek students based on their academic performance, which resulted in four levels of performance ( Figure 4  ) [ 28  ]. Given the potential of clustering to enhance personalized learning, future research could focus on integrating it with other methodologies to better understand and improve student performance outcomes. Due to its unsupervised nature, clustering is typically not evaluated using cross-validation methods. Instead, its success is assessed by how well it separates distinct groups and reveals meaningful relationships between variables.   
 Association rules mining (ARM) discovery reveals interesting relationships between variables in large data sets [ 32  ]. It is particularly effective in analyzing large amounts of student-related data, such as academic performance and behavioral data, to uncover hidden relationships. For example, ARM can be used to identify which combinations of courses or study habits are often associated with academic success or failure [ 14  ]. This information could be used to guide the adaptation of curriculum and teaching methods. 
  Algorithms like Apriori and FP-growth are commonly employed to generate association rules. Association rules highlight relationships between variables, such as how particular grades in prerequisite courses predict performance in subsequent ones. Association rule mining has been used to improve decision-making, allowing educational managers to design interventions tailored to the needs of specific student groups based on the rules identified. The strength of these rules is often evaluated using evaluation metrics like support, confidence, and lift, which provide insights into the reliability and relevance of the discovered patterns [ 32  ].   
 Sequential pattern mining (SPM) is a method that focuses on identifying and analyzing sequences of events or behaviors over time. In the context of education, SPM helps in understanding how students’ progress through learning activities, capturing patterns in their interactions with learning management systems or standard routes through a curriculum [ 26  ]. For example, SPM can reveal common sequences of mistakes or successful strategies in problem-solving, which can then be used to guide instructional design and provide personalized feedback [ 33  ]. 
  SPM tracks the order of activities, such as when students watch video lectures, complete assignments, or participate in discussions, to predict academic outcomes. This analysis is valuable in courses involving complex tasks like programming, where understanding how students approach a problem, including the sequence of errors and corrections, can lead to better learning interventions. Sequential pattern mining (SPM) was used in a small fraction of studies, accounting for approximately 2.1% of the papers reviewed [ 13  , 14  ].   
 Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of computational linguistics that aims to enable machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It bridges the gap between humans’ natural language and computers’ binary code. 
  In EDM, NLP is particularly used to analyze textual data generated by students in various educational contexts. NLP techniques allow for the processing of unstructured text data, transforming them into information that can be used for predicting student performance, detecting at-risk students, and enhancing feedback mechanisms. NLP has been applied to evaluate students’ free-form comments and written assignments, using tools like Word2Vec and artificial neural networks to identify patterns in language usage and correlate them with learning outcomes [ 22  ]. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), GGANN, GGNN, and TBCNN algorithms are used for this scope. Furthermore, sentiment analysis can be employed to gauge students’ emotional responses to course materials, providing educators with valuable information to tailor their teaching strategies and improve overall student engagement. According to Choi, only 4.2% of studies between 2018 and 2023 used this method [ 14  ].   
 NLP is also used to process and analyze discussion forum interactions, social media posts, and feedback surveys to gain deeper insights into student engagement and emotions ( Figure 5  ). This kind of analysis allows educators to assess the cognitive and emotional states of students, thereby providing timely interventions when necessary [ 33  ]. By identifying linguistic patterns that indicate confusion, frustration, or disengagement, NLP can offer real-time feedback to both students and educators, helping to personalize learning experiences and improve student outcomes [ 3  , 22  ].   
 Social Network Analysis (SNA) examines the relationships and interactions between entities, such as students and educators, in educational settings. By mapping the flow of communication and collaboration, SNA provides insights into how students form learning communities, share knowledge, and develop a better school climate that can influence academic performance [ 34  ]. This approach is particularly useful for analyzing online discussion forums, collaborative learning environments, and other learning networks. The relationships between individuals are represented as graphs, where nodes represent individuals and edges represent the interactions between them [ 34  ]. 
  SNA has been applied to predict student performance by examining the strength and structure of social interactions ( Figure 6  ). It is also found that centrality predicts future academic performance over and above a prior GPA. Students who are more centrally located within a learning network tend to perform better academically [ 34  ]. Conversely, students who are more isolated or have fewer social interactions may be at higher risk of dropping out or performing poorly. SNA allows educators to identify at-risk students early and intervene by encouraging more collaborative behaviors, thereby improving learning outcomes [ 6  , 13  ].   
 Data visualization can help both students and teachers. Data visualization tools can effectively present information to students in an intuitive way, helping them understand their learning progress in real time. These tools also support classroom instruction, teaching interventions, and evaluations, while enabling educators to adjust their teaching goals, methods, and management strategies to enhance decision-making [ 35  ]. 
  Data visualization techniques help to visualize data sets and to interpret them graphically, indicating complex data patterns in a simple way. Efficient data visualizations help expose existing data trends, outliers, and patterns since they reveal changes occurring over time [ 36  ]. Tools commonly used for presenting these findings include heatmaps that change depending on density, dashboards, and interactive graphs, which are commonly used to present findings in an accessible manner [ 22  ]. These tools not only enhance understanding but also facilitate informed decision-making by allowing educators and learners to engage with the data dynamically.   
 Data visualizations significantly enhance instructional strategies by allowing educators to quickly identify trends and patterns, which aids in making informed decisions about curriculum adjustments [ 36  ]. They enable targeted interventions by visualizing data, helping teachers tailor support to meet individual student needs and fostering a more personalized learning environment. Additionally, visualization tools facilitate the creation of reports that track student progress, promoting a culture of continuous improvement. Future data visualization tools may provide real-time insights into student understanding, enabling educators to adapt their teaching methods on the fly, ultimately leading to better educational outcomes.   
  
 6. EDM Topics  
 The EDM is used to support many different educational needs at the teaching and administrative levels. In order to provide an accurate representation of the thematic domains of the EDM discipline, the literature reviews [ 13  , 14  , 22  , 23  ] were used to record the progress of the research topics over the years.   
 A dominant theme of EDM is pattern learning, which includes studies that analyze how students learn and behave in educational contexts. The main goal is to understand the learning process by examining patterns in the way students interact with learning systems and educational content. Much of the research has focused on discovering sub-groups of students with similar learning styles and evaluating the effectiveness of teaching methods [ 4  , 30  ]. The results of the research can help educational authorities in designing effective curricula and interventions tailored to the needs of students. According to Ozyurt et al., 27.22% of the studies between 2008 and 2022 have pattern learning as an objective [ 22  ]. 
  Recommendation systems in EDM can enhance personalized learning by providing students and educators with tailored suggestions that improve educational outcomes. These systems use algorithms to recommend courses, learning materials, and resources that align with individual student needs and preferences. By analyzing historical data, such as academic performance and behavior patterns, recommendation systems can predict future learning requirements and suggest the most relevant educational content. For instance, they help students select the most suitable courses or assignments, thereby optimizing their learning path and improving academic performance. Moreover, these systems can assist educators in developing customized learning plans for students, improving the overall quality of education by fostering more personalized and efficient learning experiences [ 37  ]. 
  Educational recommendation systems (ERS) not only focus on students but also support other actors in the educational environment, such as teachers and administrators. These systems can suggest research materials, resources, and professional development opportunities that align with the interests and career goals of educators. Additionally, recommendation systems can be applied to course management, helping instructors tailor curricula to the needs of their students and identify the most effective teaching methods. By automating these processes, ERS contributes significantly to the improvement of educational quality indicators [ 10  , 37  ].   
 Sentiment analysis and feedback help educational institutions to evaluate the quality of courses and programs from the student’s perspective. Within this theme, studies have focused on developing approaches to analyze textual data from sources, such as open-ended survey responses, online discussions, and assignments using Natural Language Processing and machine learning [ 38  ]. Sentiment analysis provides valuable insights for educators on how to enhance student satisfaction, engagement, and motivation. 
  Analysis of data from MOOCs and online learning platforms involves the use of several machine learning methods applied to online and blended learning models. The field continues to be important as virtual and hybrid education become dominant, especially in the COVID-19 era [ 39  ]. Researchers in this area are trying to optimize the design of online courses, promote participation, and enhance the digital learning experience. 
  Learning analytics uses techniques to process massive educational and classroom-level data to gain insights into learning behaviors, understand learner profiles, and predict educational-related outcomes. This area has become increasingly important in recent years as technology-enhanced learning and large data sets are generated [ 40  ]. Learning analytics help to develop ideas for personalizing learning experiences, monitoring progress, and improving program design. 
  Performance prediction, in the form of final grades, exam grades, and assessment of the risk of failure also informs targeted interventions. Advances in machine learning have enabled more accurate predictions. By analyzing characteristics such as demographics, prior academic history, measures of effort, and engagement, performance prediction develops performance prediction models and can thus identify at-risk students [ 28  , 41  ]. This allows for targeted academic support and optimization of teaching methodologies. 
  Finally, student clustering applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to discover groups of students with similar characteristics without predefined labels. Clustering supports the development of personalized, differentiated teaching by recognizing student diversity and grouping students accordingly. 
  In order to examine the longitudinal trends in each topic, the data from a literature review [ 30  ] were used and the percentage of each topic over time was calculated; Figure 7  provides a visual representation of the trends.   
 Figure 7  illustrates the shifting focus of research topics in EMD over the period from 2008 to 2022. Initially, learning patterns and behavior dominated the field, peaking at 40.00% in 2008–2010. However, its importance has gradually decreased, stabilizing at 25.70% in 2020–2022, although it remains the dominant topic overall. Recommendation systems have maintained a constant level of interest, fluctuating slightly between 16.25% and 16.36% over the years. Sentiment and feedback analysis, on the other hand, has seen a significant increase, rising steadily from 7.50% in 2008–2010 to 15.21% in 2020–2022, reflecting the growing importance of understanding learner sentiment. MOOCs and online learning platforms showed a significant drop in interest from 16.25% in 2008–2010 to 8.95% in 2020–2022. Learning analytics showed a significant upward trend, increasing from 5.00% to 12.13% over the same period. Another emerging area is performance prediction, which was absent in the first period but has grown steadily to reach 8.57% in 2020–2022. On the other hand, the clustering of student profiles has seen a gradual decline from 8.75% in 2008–2010 to 5.68% in 2020–2022. These trends suggest an increasing focus on areas such as sentiment analysis, learning analytics, and performance prediction, which have gained significant attention in recent years.   
  
 7. EDM Basic Applications  
 We should emphasize that EDM encompasses a wide and diverse range of applications, adaptable to various educational environments and contexts. The proper analysis and examination of data regarding student performance and learning preferences by teachers leads to increased engagement and better academic results for the students, which leads to a conducive learning environment [ 13  , 30  ]. These findings help to design adaptive learning systems that are able to be modified dynamically and create a unique teaching/learning experience both within the traditional classroom setting as well as through online e-learning platforms. By creating and maintaining detailed student profiles based on their interactions with such systems, educators can make predictions about future performance trends, adjust their instructional methods accordingly, and assist with personalized learning that meets individual student needs [ 2  ].   
 On the other hand, early warning systems show a remarkable ability to track students who are at risk of falling behind by analyzing datasets of students’ academic performance and engagement in the learning process over time. Such advanced tools are key to informing teachers and students in a timely manner of the need for additional support and resources, thus facilitating interventions that prevent students from dropping out and providing equal opportunities for students [ 10  ].   
 EDM plays a significant and transformative role in the complex and multifaceted process of curriculum design by uncovering and identifying which specific courses or teaching methods are most beneficial for student learning outcomes. By analyzing student feedback combined with performance data, educational authorities are empowered to improve their curricula in ways that better meet the diverse needs of students and their individual learning goals, thereby fostering an enhanced educational experience [ 3  , 10  ].   
 EDM can also improve pedagogical evaluation methods, as it provides useful information about students’ learning experiences and clarifies any ambiguities they may have about what happened in that particular lesson. In addition, personalizing feedback through automated assessment systems can help students identify and understand their mistakes, thus improving learning processes and academic performance, as well as reducing teacher workload [ 4  ].   
 EDM can be used as a management tool that helps in the allocation of resources in the best manner. Although the question of how much to allocate requires wider agreements, through analysis of student enrollments, course approval, and resource use, administrators are able to make informed decisions about staffing, scheduling, and investments in educational technologies [ 6  ]. Visualization technology provides real-time visualizations of student data, allowing teachers and administrator staff to monitor and quickly identify trends. These dashboards support data-driven decision-making and promote a continuous improvement mindset [ 1  ].   
 The above list of EDM applications is indicative. Moreover, the ever-increasing number of publications in the scientific field constantly reveals new approaches and applications of this discipline.   
  
 8. Challenges  
 EDM offers significant potential for improving educational outcomes but faces several important challenges. These challenges arise from the nature of the methods used, the complexity of educational contexts, the nature of educational data, and ethical considerations. This diversity of potential risks requires careful scheduling and preprocessing, as inaccurate analyses drive misleading conclusions [ 4  ].   
 According to Pardo and Siemens [ 42  ], educational data often contain sensitive information about students, teachers, and other people that needs strict privacy protections under laws like FERPA and GDPR. Other than legal compliance, ethical concerns include transparency around how data can be used as well as ensuring that its analysis supports students without causing them any harm, like reinforcing their biases or interfering with their autonomy [ 1  ]. Thus, it is imperative that strong ethical frameworks and guidelines are established for responsible handling of such matters.   
 It is important for the results to have explanatory power. Although neural networks and other complicated models may produce the right predictions, teachers are often unable to understand and trust them [ 7  ]. This type of “black box” approach hindered use in educational contexts where decision-making requirements call for clarity. The development of simpler models that can be explained easily remains a challenge.   
 Scalability is another challenge as educational data continues to grow exponentially [ 24  ]. It is vital that these models are able to scale with an increasing amount of information without sacrificing any efficiency or correctness. In this case, it may require optimizing algorithms, processing massive datasets using cloud computing, and ongoing examination of algorithm performance after new data sets are introduced. There is a rising demand for real-time data analysis, particularly in settings where adaptive learning takes place. Having efficient tools for processing data through advanced algorithms is one aspect of real-time analysis. It involves addressing issues that have to do with speed and processing infrastructure and making sure that the real-time information is accurate as well as useful [ 1  ].   
 Educational data are influenced by many cultural, social, and institutional factors. These factors can significantly affect outcomes and must be taken into account to ensure the reliability of results [ 10  ]. Developing models that take these contextual variables into account increases complexity by requiring collaboration with educators and experts to incorporate contextual variables into data analysis processes, but it is necessary to provide information applicable to different educational settings. EDM involves collaboration across many disciplines, including computer science, education, psychology, and statistics. Bridging these fields is difficult but essential [ 4  ]. The interdisciplinary approach allows for the development of more integrated models that can address complex educational challenges. However, it also requires effective communication and collaboration between stakeholders. Continuous study is needed to resolve these issues. Researchers must develop new machine learning algorithms and data processing systems that are both innovative and ethical. Furthermore, communication between teachers, researchers, and decision-makers promotes the evolution of best practices. Addressing moral concerns and aligning EDM with educational objectives will ensure that EDM is used responsibly.   
  
 9. Future Trends  
 EDM had a remarkable development linked to the rapid developments of algorithms, combined with the increase in the amount of available data. As the field continues to grow, several trends are shaping.   
 The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with EDM is expected to be pronounced [ 43  ]. The use of AI and the development of recommendation systems can bring significant improvements to the quality of education that students receive. On the other hand, the integration with AI increases the challenges associated with the accumulation, control, and handling of the data, while the critical issue of personal data security is raised. Breakthrough AI technologies have the ability to use large amounts of data and present many new and exciting learning opportunities. From this point of view, EDM functions as a driver by providing insights into how the students interact and engage in virtual environments and thus contributes to the improvement of the educational content [ 44  ].   
 The integration of data mining and deep learning techniques into augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications has significantly enhanced the educational experience by offering immersive, interactive learning environments. These technologies facilitate a deeper level of engagement and personalization, enabling educators to tailor educational content more effectively to individual student needs. In particular, deep learning, through Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis, has been employed to analyze large datasets from educational platforms and social media [ 45  ]. This analysis provides critical insights into student attitudes, behaviors, and learning preferences, allowing for the optimization of AR and VR educational content. For instance, the analysis of social media data has proven valuable in understanding public sentiment and perspectives on the use of AR and VR in education, thereby informing the development of more effective learning tools [ 46  ].   
 In AR, deep learning models enhance adaptability by recognizing the real-world reactions of students and providing real-time feedback, creating dynamic, visually engaging educational experiences. These applications allow students to interact with complex concepts in a tangible manner, improving comprehension and retention. Similarly, VR benefits from deep learning by predicting student behaviors and learning preferences, enabling the creation of personalized, immersive virtual environments. These environments can adjust to individual learning paces and styles, leading to more effective educational outcomes. Through the use of data-driven insights, AR and VR technologies not only improve the learning process but also foster a richer, more interactive platform for students, contributing to higher engagement and better academic performance [ 46  , 47  ].   
 However, the already established fields of use of EDM also attract the interest of researchers. One of the most significant trends in EDM is the advancement of predictive analytics, particularly in the areas of student performance and retention. Predictive regression and classification models are becoming more sophisticated. The use of massive amounts of data is helping to better predict student performance and identify students who may be struggling or dropping out. In particular, the emphasis on predicting dropout risk has grown significantly, as highlighted by Refs. [ 46  , 47  ]. These models use different types of data to predict future academic performance. Educational institutions are likely to follow this trend as a means of improving the academic success of their students through data-driven interventions, which could also help them to improve their retention rates [ 23  ]. Students’ performance continues to be the primary subject of research [ 48  , 49  , 50  , 51  , 52  , 53  , 54  , 55  , 56  , 57  , 58  , 59  ].   
 Educational environments generate an increasing amount of unstructured data. These data can be in the form of text, video, social media interactions, and more. This necessitates the integration of unstructured data analysis into EDM [ 22  ]. While traditional educational data mining methods have primarily focused on structured data, the rise of big data has necessitated the implementation of techniques that can handle unstructured data. The processing and analysis of unstructured data provide an opportunity to gain further insight into student behavior and learning processes. Another reason for the increasing use of unstructured data is the use of NLP [ 45  ]. The data used are texts, comments, or posts in forums and educational platforms. A common objective of all these methods is to improve student performance [ 22  ].   
 Learning analysis continues to be a main focus of interest. Data on the interaction between educational content and everyday classroom teaching are used to develop frameworks and models of effective teaching methods [ 7  , 31  ]. Sentiment analysis has also become increasingly popular in recent years. Teachers and administrative staff can better understand what students want and where they need to improve by analyzing feedback from course evaluations, discussion forums, and social media. These details can then be used to make data-driven decisions to enhance the learning experience [ 7  , 49  ]. LA continues to attract the interest of researchers [ 60  , 61  , 62  , 63  , 64  , 65  ].   
 Personalized recommendation systems are also becoming more and more sophisticated and provide students with accurate and tailored learning recommendations. The integration of NLP techniques into text data provides information that allows students to identify problems in their learning path [ 47  ]. This makes recommender systems an effective tool for promoting self-directed learning. The evolution of recommendation systems is expected to continue as institutions prioritize the quality of education they provide [ 23  , 50  ]. The importance of recommendation systems is also linked to the growing trend of lifelong learning. As people seek to learn new skills throughout their lives through e-learning systems, recommendation systems can help them find the most relevant and effective learning pathways. Overall, recommendation systems are the primary research topic in 2024 [ 66  , 67  , 68  , 69  , 70  , 71  ].   
 EDM is a powerful tool to support decision-making in educational environments. EDM can optimize curriculum design, personalize learning experiences, and improve resource allocation. By providing data-driven information, it enhances institutions’ ability to make informed, strategic decisions that lead to better educational outcomes. Decision support has been a trend in recent years, particularly in higher and online education [ 72  , 73  , 74  , 75  , 76  , 77  , 78  , 79  ].   
 As EDM continues to evolve, educational institutions can leverage these tools to improve student engagement, retention, and overall learning success. The continuous advancements in EDM promise to reshape the landscape of modern education, fostering a more data-driven and personalized learning environment. These trends indicate a dynamic evolution in the EDM landscape, focusing on practical applications and interdisciplinary collaboration.

 11th International Workshop on Engineering Multi-Agent Systems  
 In conjunction with AAMAS 2023  (29-30 May 2023, London, UK)  
 News:  The EMAS 2023 Post-Proceedings volume  is now available!  
   
  A key unifying theme underlying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning is the idea of intelligent software agents able to reason, act, interact, and learn. This metaphor has stimulated much research in AI and particularly in Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems, giving rise to research in agent-oriented software engineering, programming multi-agent systems, and declarative agent languages and technologies.  
 The Engineering Multi-Agent Systems (EMAS)  workshop has been held as part of AAMAS  since 2013, and was previously affiliated to AAMAS through Agent-Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE)  , Programming Multiagent Systems (ProMAS)  , and Declarative Agent Languages and Technologies (DALT)  since the first AAMAS in 2002.  
 EMAS 2023 will provide a forum for researchers and practitioners interested in the theory and practice of engineering intelligent agents and multi-agent systems (MAS). The overall purpose of the workshop is to facilitate the cross-fertilization of ideas and experiences in the various fields to:  
 enhance our knowledge of the theory and practice of engineering intelligent agents and multi-agent systems, and advance the state of the art; 
  demonstrate how MAS methodologies, architectures, languages, and tools can be used in the engineering of deployed large-scale, open, and data-driven MAS; 
  define new directions for engineering MAS by drawing on results and recommendations from related research areas; and 
  encourage Ph.D. and Master’s students to become involved in and contribute to the area. 
  Despite the substantial body of knowledge and expertise developed in the design and development of MAS, the systematic development of large-scale and open MAS still poses many challenges. Even though various languages, models, techniques, and methodologies have been proposed in the literature, researchers and developers are still faced with fundamental questions attaining MAS engineering, such as:  
 How to specify, design, implement, verify, test, and validate large-scale and open MAS? 
  How to ensure and control the global behaviour of decentralised, large-scale, and open MAS? 
  How to seamlessly integrate AI, machine learning, and data-driven techniques into the design and development of agent-based systems? 
  Which (multi-)agent architectures and languages are most suitable for MAS in different domains? 
  How to engineer agent and multi-agent systems that are secure and protect the privacy concerns of users? 
  How to scale to the complexity of real-world application domains? 
  What are the implications of MAS engineering in the context of continuous development and deployment? 
  How can MAS be applied in specific application areas, such as Cyber-Physical Systems and Internet of Things / Web of Things? 
  How to seamlessly integrate MAS engineering with mainstream software engineering models, languages, frameworks and tools? 
  Which processes and methodologies can integrate the above and provide a disciplined approach to the engineering of MAS?

  Overview  
 EICS 2023 is the fifteenth international ACM SIGCHI conference devoted to engineering interactive computing systems and their user interfaces, addressing one or more software quality factors, such as usability, user experience, reliability, security, etc.  
 Work presented at EICS covers all stages of the engineering life-cycle of interactive systems - inception, requirements, design, specification, coding, data analytics, validation and verification, deployment and maintenance. EICS has the longest tradition of bringing together researchers who contribute to better ways of creating interactive computing systems, stemming from the conference on command languages in the seventies. The conference is best known for rigorously contributing and disseminating research results that hold the midst in between user interface design, software engineering and computational interaction.  
 EICS focuses on models, languages, notations, methods, techniques and tools that support designing, developing, validating and verifying interactive systems. The conference brings together people who study or practice the engineering of interactive systems, drawing from design, HCI, software engineering, requirements engineering, software development, modeling, and programming. Submissions advance the state of the art of the engineering of interactive systems.  
 The conference proceedings are published by the ACM and appear in the ACM Digital Library. The full paper are published in the journal PACM EICS series. Further information at https://eics.acm.org/pacm/  .  
 Openning Keynote  
  Crafting interactive experiences with non-programmers   
 Chris Greenhalgh   , University of Nottingham, UK  
  https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszcmg/   
 Summary:  The Mixed Reality Lab has a long history of creating public interactive experiences in collaboration with creative practitioners. Looking across four such experiences, this keynote explores the role of code (i.e., bespoke software) in making them possible, the practicalities of non-programmers “authoring” key parts of the experience, the relationship between coding and knowledge production, and the changing nature of technical responsibilities. As well as being personally and inherently satisfying, the practical realization of novel interactive systems manifests new creative “materials”, which open the door to new experiences and understandings of people and the world.  
 Chris Greenhalgh  is a Professor of Computer Science in the School of Computer Science at the University of Nottingham, where he is a co-leader of the Mixed Reality Laboratory  and a member of Horizon Digital Economy Research  Institute. He gained a first class BA (with distinction) in Electrical and Information Sciences from Cambridge University in 1991. He then worked in the data communications group at the GEC Hirst Research Centre for two years before moving to Nottingham, where he gained a PhD for his work with large scale collaborative virtual environments in 1997. His thesis was a winner of the 1998 BCS/CPHC Distinguished Dissertations in Computer Science competition. He has been a member of academic staff in the School of Computer Science since 1996. He has served as Senior Tutor and Director of Taught Programmes for the School, and contributed to the University's adoption and use of Moodle, an open-source virtual learning environment.  
   
 Mid-Keynote  
  Speeding Up the Engineering of Interactive Systems with Generative AI   
 Albrecht Schmidt   , Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Germany  
  https://www.um.informatik.uni-muenchen.de/personen/professoren/schmidt/index.html   
 Summary:  This keynote discusses the opportunities and challenges of using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) as tools for developing interactive systems. We will look at different stages in the development lifecycle of interactive systems and assess the value of AI support. We explore how GenAI and LLMs can potentially speed-up the ideation, requirements elicitation, architecture development, prototyping, implementation, and testing of interactive systems. The talk will outline emerging practices, such as the use of prompts for code and system generation, to facilitate prototyping and accelerate implementation. We will outline fundamental challenges and suggest emerging research directions, and pose research questions. What will software development tools look like in the future? How can we efficiently use AI to develop interactive systems without compromising quality? We also speculate about the implications of these developments for researchers, practitioners, and society. We believe that it will massively accelerate the digital transformation. Interactive AI-based tools for systems and software development will become a major research direction.  
 Albrecht Schmidt  is professor for Human-Centered Ubiquitous Media in the computer science department of the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München in Germany. He studied computer science in Ulm and Manchester and received a PhD from Lancaster University, UK, in 2003. He held several prior academic positions at different universities, including Stuttgart, Cambridge, Duisburg-Essen, and Bonn and also worked as a researcher at the Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS) and at Microsoft Research in Cambridge. In his research, he investigates the inherent complexity of human-computer interaction in ubiquitous computing environments, particularly in view of increasing computer intelligence and system autonomy. Albrecht has actively contributed to the scientific discourse in human-computer interaction through the development, deployment, and study of functional prototypes of interactive systems and interface technologies in different real world domains. His early experimental work addressed the use of diverse sensors to recognize situations and interactions, influencing our understanding of context-awareness and situated computing. He proposed the concept of implicit human-computer interaction. Over the years, he worked on automotive user interfaces, tangible interaction, interactive public display systems, interaction with large high-resolution screens, and physiological interfaces. Most recently, he focuses on how information technology can provide cognitive and perceptual support to amplify the human mind. To investigate this further, he received in 2016 a ERC grant. Albrecht has co-chaired several SIGCHI conferences; he is in the editorial board of ACM TOCHI, edits a forum in ACM interactions, a column of human augmentation in IEEE Pervasive, and formerly edited a column on interaction technologies in IEEE Computer. The ACM conferences on tangible and embedded interaction in 2007 and on automotive user interfaces in 2010 were co-founded by him. In 2018, Albrecht was induced into the ACM SIGCH Academy and in 2020, he was elected into Leopoldina, the Germany academy of natural science.  
   
 Closing Keynote  
  Ethical design for wellbeing and affective health   
 Corina Sas   , School of Computing and Communications at Lancaster University, UK  
  https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/scc/about-us/people/corina-sas   
 Summary:  Emotional wellbeing and mental health are topics of much social significance, which are also reflected in the growing HCI work aimed to support them. Research in this area covers a broad space from affective computing to affective interaction approach, and the ethical design of wellbeing and mental health technologies has become much needed. This talk will provide design exemplars of technologies for wellbeing and mental health, with an emphasis on the importance of supporting emotional awareness and regulation. The talk will also highlight the value of existing research for articulating novel design implications for ethical wellbeing and mental health technologies.  
 Corina Sas  is Professor in Human-Computer Interaction with the School of Computing and Communications at Lancaster University, UK. Her research focuses on designing and evaluating technologies for wellbeing, mental health, memory support, creative and reflective thinking in design, as well as novel tools for designing such technologies. Her work explores and integrates wearable bio sensors, mobile and lifelogging technologies with the aim to shape the interaction design and user experience.  
  Corina served as General co-Chair of the 14th and 15th ACM Creativity and Cognition Conference 2021, 2022, and of the British HCI Conference in 2007. She has also extensively served as Associate Chair for CHI and DIS, and has been Subcommittee Co-Chair for DIS.

 Ethicomp  
 As it seems that our world is reopening, we are happy to inform you that Ethicomp is held physically in Turku, Finland, July 26-28, 2022. We are not going to continue with the virtual conference as we see that there is a need for real participation where we can meet each other in person, and this cannot be achieved in a virtual conference. Because of this, if the situation (Covid-19 or other issues) prevents physical meeting, the conference will be postponed to 2023 – not turned to a virtual one anymore.  
 The theme of this Ethicomp is the “ Effectiveness of ICT ethics – How do we help solve ethical problems in the field of ICT?  ” It is easy to pinpoint problems and state that something is ethically problematic. It is much harder to give proper suggestions on how to improve the situation through constructive and executable ideas.  
 So please stay tuned.  

 News

 ABOUT   
  
 This conference follows a series of successful international conferences initiated in 2004 by the INTUITION Network of Excellence in Virtual and Augmented Reality, supported by the European Commission until 2008. Embedded within the Joint Virtual Reality Conferences (JVRC) from 2009 to 2013, it was known as the EuroVR international conferences from 2014 and until 2020. This year, EuroXR will be held collocated with Immersive Tech Week (formerly VRDays)    
 Apart from annually gathering the EuroXR members for the association life, the focus of EuroXR conference is on novel VR/AR/MR technologies, including software systems, display technology, interaction devices, and applications. Besides papers on the latest scientific results and highlights from many application fields, the EuroXR conference series aims at creating a unique human-dimension framework, interconnecting European and international XR communities, for knowledge cross-fertilisations between researchers, technology providers, and end-users.   
 In-person conferences provide a unique opportunity for researchers to meet, chat, and catch up on the latest developments in the field, as well as absorb all the excellent talks and demos. It is also super important to build networks, especially for early career researchers.

 Scope   
   
 1. Open Track  (Dr. Shalini Kesar, Southern Utah University, kesar@suu.edu; and Orlando Lima Rua, Polytechnic of Porto, orua@iscap.ipp.pt; Adrian-Horia Dediu, Autonomous University of Lisbon, adediu@autonoma.pt)  
 Any topic in computer ethics, broadly construed. Topics related to the field of computer ethics, conceived broadly to include philosophical, professional, and practical aspects of the field.  
 2. Let’s reevaluate cybersecurity best practices  (Shalini Kesar, Southern Utah University, kesar@suu.edu; and Sabina Szymoniak Czestochowa University of Technology, sabina.szymoniak@icis.pcz.pl)  
 Today’s society is becoming more dependent on technology, where organizations and individuals cannot function without smart devices in their daily lives. Nowadays, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Internet of Things (IoT) is playing a key role in defining cybersecurity best practices. For example, AI-powered threat detection, anomaly detection, and automated response systems are becoming more sophisticated in identifying and mitigating cyber threats, as well as identifying threats and vulnerabilities. To manage and minimize these data threats, it is important for organizations to reevaluate their cybersecurity strategies and best practices. This track invites articles that discuss the emerging trends in cybersecurity along with their ethical implications of digital interaction when organizations are developing best practices.  
 3. Ethical challenges of human relations in education in the AI era  (Mario Arias-Oliva, Universidad Complutense de Madrid Mar Souto-Romero, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos de Madrid, mario.arias@ucm.es; Antonio Pérez-Portabella, Universitat Rovira i Virgili Graciela Padilla Castillo, Universidad Complutense de Madrid; antonio. perezportabella@urv.cat)  
 Digital technologies offer numerous benefits to educational relationships, including improved communication, collaboration, and access to resources. However, they also present challenges that educators, students, and policymakers must navigate carefully to ensure positive and equitable outcomes. Teacher-student relationships have changed, with teachers becoming facilitators rather than sole sources of knowledge. While technology improves communication between students, teachers, and parents, it can also affect peer relationships, where online collaboration can lead to reduced face-to-face interaction. Excessive digital communication can diminish empathy and social skills, while virtual communities can foster a sense of belonging in online education. Furthermore, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into education introduces new dimensions to these relationships. AI-powered tutoring systems and chatbots can provide personalized support to students, but they also raise concerns about the role of human educators and the potential loss of human connection in the learning process. This track welcomes submissions that explore the multifaceted impact of digital technologies on education in general, including contributions on digital human relationships in education, such as changes in teacher-student dynamics, peer interactions, mentoring, virtual communities, and the ethical implications of AI in learning environments.  
 4. Gender and Future Digital Technologies  (Shalini Kesar, Southern Utah University, kesar@suu.edu)  
 With emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things, it is important to explore the role of gender, as gender disparity can create barriers to managing and sustaining digital technologies. Diverse perspectives and technological innovation can help overcome challenges to economic growth, productivity, solve complex technological problems, drive innovation, and shape the future of technology across multiple sectors. This track welcomes paper proposals from scholars across all fields, as well as practitioners, policymakers, educators, and others whose work or experiences overlap with this theme.  
 5. The normative challenges of AI literacy  (Ludovica Paseri, UNITO, ludovica.paseri@unito.it; and Ugo Pagallo, UNITO, ugo.pagallo@unito.it)  
 The rapid pace of AI development drives the need for investigations into human-machine and machine-to-machine interactions. Exploring the ethical and legal implications of AI-mediated interactions is critical to safeguarding fundamental and human rights. In addition to the challenges related to the misuse or abuse of AI, an often under-researched but highly relevant topic is AI literacy. The relevance of the topic is shown by Section 10.2 lett. (d) vii of the White House Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of AI of October 2023, and by Article 4 of the AI Act (EU Reg. 2024/1689) in EU law, which concerns ‘AI literacy’, stating that “Providers and deployers of AI systems shall take measures to ensure, to the best of their ability, a sufficient level of AI literacy of their staff and other persons dealing with the operation and use of AI systems on their behalf”. In this context, it is crucial to question the normative implications of AI literacy, examining the accountability and applicability of the US Executive Order and Article 4 of the AI Act; the various models of AI literacy; risks of inequality and digital exclusion; the social disadvantages arising from the lack of digital skills and competencies, etc. The track is open for applications with the aim of discussing AI literacy from an interdisciplinary perspective to contribute to the debate on responsible and trustworthy uses of AI in different areas, such as healthcare, education, scientific research, and industry, among others.  
 6. (De)stigmatize digital interactions and technologies  (Adam Poulsen, Centre for Brain and Mind, University of Sydney, adam.poulsen@sydney.edu.au; Frank Iorfino, Centre for Brain and Mind, University of Sydney, frank.iorfino@sydney.edu.au)  
 Digital interactions and technologies perpetuate or challenge stigma. For example, persistent stigma around mental health leads young people to turn to social media for mental health information and support. However, they encounter biased moderation or harassment of social media content that negatively impacts stigmatized groups discussing, for example, LGBTQ+ issues or mental health. As another example, sex robots present an opportunity to promote the sexual rights of vulnerable groups, such as those with physical disabilities or the elderly. However, the topic of sex robots remains stigmatized in academia, industry, and the public. This track explores the dual role of digital interactions and technologies in exacerbating and combating stigma. It invites submissions that address stigmatized digital interactions (e.g., sex robot use and virtual reality pornography); stigma-reducing digital interactions (e.g., online mental health resources and help-seeking); stigma-based barriers to digital interactions (e.g., cultural norms and stereotypes); and perpetuating or challenging prejudice against stigmatized groups through digital interactions (e.g., promoting or dismantling online digital activism among stigmatized groups, supporting or hindering rights, advocacy, community building, and empowerment). This track also welcomes articles on related ethical implications and topics, including equity, equality, fairness, justice, access, (in)visibility, cyberbullying, anonymity, and safety.  
 7. Artificial Intelligence: Interpretability and Measurement of its Underlying Ethics  (Ramón Carrasco, Complutense University of Madrid, ramoncar@ucm.es)  
 The ability of artificial intelligence (AI) to pass the Turing test is now an indisputable reality. This indicates that AI has reached a level of similarity to human behavior in several aspects, including the ability to speak, reason, and even exhibit a degree of creativity. However, consciousness remains a separate challenge. While it currently seems unlikely that AI could develop true consciousness with existing technology, it is plausible that it could convincingly mimic consciousness, potentially passing a hypothetical “consciousness test.” The rapid evolution of AI suggests its integration into many activities that were previously performed exclusively by humans. This transition raises two critical challenges, which this seminar aims to address: 1) Interpretability of AI: Understanding how and why AI makes decisions is essential to building trust in its use. This can be achieved through approaches such as explainable artificial intelligence (XAI); 2) Measuring AI ethics: Given the increasing autonomy of AI, it is crucial to assess, for example, whether its decisions are fair, transparent, and accountable. Assessing these ethical dimensions ensures that AI integrates responsibly into society. This seminar seeks to explore both of these topics, fostering an interdisciplinary dialogue that encourages the development of more understandable and ethically responsible AI.  
 8. Values: the basis for responsible technology and digital interactions  (Kirsten Wahlstrom, University of South Australia, kirsten.wahlstrom@unisa.edu.au; Mamello Thinyane, University of South Australia, mamello.thinyane@unisa.edu.au)  
 Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) permeate almost every sphere of life and have brought about changes that harm some while benefiting others. One example that highlights the ethical risks and challenges associated with automated decision-making processes is the UK Post Office’s Horizon system, which was an accounting system developed by Fujitsu. Horizon had flaws that led the Post Office to take debt collection action against postmasters. Many other adverse impacts of ICTs have been documented, including those associated with recent advances in artificial intelligence. To mitigate these adverse outcomes, many instruments have been formulated; these aim to infuse values into the design, development and deployment of ICTs and shape human-machine interactions. However, this is not trivial, as value tensions arise between different stakeholders and in different contexts. This track invites theoretical, empirical and practical contributions that address ethical considerations across the ICT lifecycle and that explore value tensions in human-machine interactions. Papers across all application domains are invited, with particular interest in papers exploring these issues in the cybersecurity domain and in teaching and professional practice.  
 9. How is AI changing us? How does it change the world?  (Xenia Ziouvelou – Associate Researcher at the National Center for Scientific Research Demokritos (NCSRD-Greece), Head of AI Politeia Lab, xeniaziouvelou@gmail.com)  
 The transformative power of technology is undeniable, permeating every aspect of life. Emerging advances in AI and generative AI are rewriting the rules of what is possible, disrupting established norms in everything from medicine and law to art, education, and research, among others. AI and generative AI tools are changing the way we work, learn, create art, conduct research, consume, and are reshaping the way we interact with humans and technology, the way we communicate, socialize, live, and behave. The interactions between AI, people, and social systems are reshaping our norms and revolutionizing the way our interactions with technology evolve and ultimately change us. While much debate has been needed recently about “human-centric” AI, more research is needed on the conditions under which AI technologies can lead to positive and negative outcomes for human behavior, agency, autonomy, rights, and freedom. As technology reshapes human societies, the need to understand the complex interactions between AI, humans, and social systems, as well as the emerging ethical and social implications, is crucial. Thus, adopting an anticipatory approach to AI development and governance.  
 10. Ethical challenges for business in a digital world  (Pedro Isidoro González Ramírez, Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí, pedro.gonzalez@uaslp.mx; Juan Carlos Yañez Luna, Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí, jcyl@uaslp.mx)  
 This track explores the intersection of business ethics and the application of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to assess the impact of ethical decision-making on organizational outcomes. As digital interactions become increasingly significant, understanding the ethical dimensions of business practices is crucial to fostering a responsible society. We invite contributions that examine how ethical considerations influence strategic decision-making, particularly in the context of digital communication. Research employing SEM can provide valuable insights into the relationships between ethical practices, customer satisfaction, brand reputation, and financial performance. By integrating theoretical frameworks with empirical analyses, this track aims to foster dialogue on the need to embed ethics in business education and practice. Case studies that demonstrate real-world applications of ethical decision-making and its consequences will be highlighted. This track seeks to engage academics, industry practitioners, and emerging researchers in a collaborative discussion, contributing to the ongoing dialogue on the ethical implications of technology and business in today’s interconnected world. Participants will have the opportunity to present their findings, share experiences and explore new methodologies in the field of business ethics.  
 11. AI, social networks and their influence on youth  (Gonçalo Valadão Matias, Autonomous University, gmatias@autonoma.pt; Isabel Alvarez, Autonomous University, ialvarez@autonoma.pt; and Nuno Silva, Lusiada University, nsas@ulusiada.pt)  
 This track explores the ethical implications of deploying AI on social media platforms primarily used by young people. As AI increasingly shapes young people’s online experiences, it is crucial to examine the ethical considerations, potential impacts, and necessary safeguards. We seek papers that address the complex interplay between AI technologies, ethical frameworks, social media platforms, learning tools, and youth well-being. This track aims to foster interdisciplinary dialogue among researchers, ethicists, AI developers, social scientists, policymakers, educators, and youth advocates. We welcome submissions on topics that include, but are not limited to: 1) Ethical considerations in AI-driven content curation for young users; 2) Privacy and data protection challenges in AI-driven youth-oriented social media; 3) The impact of AI algorithms on youth mental health and development; 4) Designing ethically aligned AI for youth-centric social platforms; 5) Ethical implications of AI-enhanced targeted advertising for young users; 6) Transparency and explainability of AI systems in youth-focused social networks; 7) AI, social networks and their influence on youth civic engagement and political participation; 8) Ethical frameworks for AI development on platforms primarily used by young people; and 9) Social networks and AI tools to facilitate learning and knowledge sharing.

 Winner of the Computer Graphics Forum 2024 Cover Image Contest  
   This image shows the inside of the teaser figure 'fertility' from Polygon Laplacian Made Robust. It visualizes the condition numbers of individual polygon stiffness matrices. The mesh transitions from the input mesh to our result from left to right. The original mesh features disfigured polygons with alarming (yellow) or terrible (magenta) condition numbers. With our tailored smoothing algorithm, polygons become very regular and, combined with our improved polygon Laplacian, result in better condition numbers (blue) and improved robustness in computational simulation. Blender was used to stylize the geometry and render the image.

 The EuroVis 2023 will be held in Leipzig, Germany in presence. This 25th edition of EuroVis will be hosted by the Leipzig University organized by the Image and Signal Processing Group – BSV in collaboration with the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research – UFZ. EuroVis is the annual Visualization Conference organized by the Eurographics Working Group on Data Visualization. It has been a Eurographics and IEEE co-supported international visualization symposium held in Europe annually since 1999, as a conference since 2012.  
 The exciting and vibrant field of Visualization is an increasingly important research area due to its wide range of applications in many disciplines. In general, our ability to collect, store, and archive data vastly exceed our ability to derive useful knowledge and insight. This is a ubiquitous problem. Data visualization is key to understanding large, complex data sets by exploiting the human visual system. Data visualization leverages computer graphics in order to provide a visual overview, explore, analyze, and present phenomena that are often difficult to understand.  
 The objective of the EuroVis conference is to create and strengthen connections between visualization researchers and practitioners, to foster collaborations, and to draw more researchers in Europe to enter this rapidly growing area of research. EuroVis has an expanded scope to include all areas of visualization and steadily more widespread visibility that allows achieving a more widespread impact.  
 The main conference is preceded by co-located events held in the same location on June 12th.

 About Leipzig  

 fLTR: Central Station, White Elster, view from New Town Hall (source: Philipp Kirschner/leipzig.travel)   
 The city is one of the most uprising cities in Germany with a rich history and culture. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Friedrich Nietzsche, and ex-chancellor Angela Merkel are all alumni of Leipzig University. Leipzig is surrounded by many beautiful lakes and nature and is close to the capital Berlin. Public transportation is included within the ticket  (valid from Sunday to Friday), so here are some impressions about our city. We are looking forward to seeing you there!  
 Other events in Leipzig around the same time:  
 26-29 May 2023: Wave-Gotik-Treffen, the largest gothic festival on this planet: the | official website | and | Wikipedia | . 
  8–18 June 2023: Bachfest | »BACH for Future«, | more information | here | .

 Welcome to EuroVis 2025   
   
 The 27th edition of EuroVis will take place in Luxembourg City, Luxembourg, and will be hosted by the Visualization and Interaction Group (VISINT) of the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST).   
 EuroVis is the premier annual conference organized by the Eurographics Working Group on Data Visualization  .  
 Since its inception in 1999 as a symposium, and its elevation to a full conference in 2012, EuroVis has grown to become one of the leading platforms for advancing visualization research and applications across Europe.  
 As a dynamic and rapidly evolving field, visualization plays a critical role in addressing one of today’s most pressing challenges: transforming vast amounts of raw data into meaningful insights. While data collection and storage capabilities have advanced exponentially, our capacity to derive actionable knowledge from this information lags behind. Visualization bridges this gap by utilizing the power of the human visual system, combined with advanced computer graphics, to offer intuitive exploration, analysis, and communication of complex data.  
 EuroVis 2025 aims to foster collaboration between visualization researchers and practitioners from across disciplines. The conference provides a unique platform for sharing groundbreaking research, building networks, and inspiring new research directions. With its broadened scope to encompass all areas of data visualization, EuroVis continues to expand its impact both within Europe and globally.  
 The main conference will be preceded by a series of co-located workshops and events, which will be held on June 2, 2025, at the same venue.  
 Join us for an enriching and inspiring experience in the heart of Luxembourg City!

 About ECRTS  
 ECRTS is a conference of Euromicro  , a non-profit organization established in 1973. It is a member of the Strategic Forum of the European Alliance for Innovation (EAI). Euromicro is governed by its Board of Directors. The technical activities of Euromicro are organized by technical committees which handle the individual events. In the case of ECRTS, this is the Technical Committee on Real-Time Systems  .

  Open access 
  Organization 
  Real-time systems  
 ECRTS promotes state-of-the-art research for applications with temporal constraints, time-sensitive, real-time systems. Such computing systems have to provide results that are not only correct in value but also delivered at the right time. Instead of average behavior as for standard computing, real-time systems have to allow for guarantees that temporal requirements will be met.  
 Quality  
 ECRTS is the premier European venue for presenting research into the broad area of real-time systems. Along with IEEE RTSS and IEEE RTAS, ECRTS ranks as one of the three top international conferences on this topic. Google Scholar Metrics  lists ECRTS as top conference per h5-index, CAPES (Brasil) as A1  .  
 Innovation  
 ECRTS has been at the forefront of recent innovations in the real-time community such as Work-in-Progress Poster sessions, Call for Actions, Artifact Evaluation, Industrial Challenges, Open-Access proceedings, etc., in the larger real-time computing community.  
 ECRTS began as a workshop in 1989, progressing to become a major international conference in 1998. ECRTS has its roots in the real-time laboratories and research groups in both academia and industry throughout Europe and across the world.  
 Open access  
 We believe that the conference serves the research community and the public best when results are accessible to the largest audience without restrictions, in particular not behind paywalls.  
 We also believe that the dissemination of results should not be restricted by the financial situation of authors, e.g. when substantial sums are required by for-profit publishers for “open access”.  
 Since 2017, ECRTS has been applying an open access publication model using LIPIcs – Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics   , a series of high-quality conference proceedings established in cooperation with Schloss Dagstuhl – Leibniz Center for Informatics   . The paper selection procedures and quality control remain unchanged, but accepted papers are made public for access without additional cost.  
 Conference fees cover publication costs, which include the cost of keeping proceedings open access.  
 Organization  
 The Technical Committee is responsible for selecting locations and organizers for ECRTS.  
 Program Chairs  are responsible for the technical program of the main conference. They are selected based on their technical achievements, standing in the community, and organizational abilities. They select Program Committee  members, who review submitted papers and, together with the Program Chair, select papers for the program of the main conference, based on their scientific quality only in a face-to-face meeting. Program chairs serve only once.  
 General Chairs  are responsible for the logistical aspects of holding the conference, such as venue, facilities for communication, networking, and community building, including financial aspects.  
 ECRTS is complemented by a series of satellite workshops, which provide lively forums for discussion and interactions on various technical topics. They complement the main conference by providing short turnaround time for contributions, enabling exchange and discussions of new ideas in their areas, and establishing communities on specific topics.  
 Workshop chairs  are responsible for proposing new or organizing the technical aspects of specific workshops, with an emphasis on novelty and innovative concepts for interaction.  
  Technical committee: Yasmina Abdeddaïm  , Sebastian Altmeyer  , Steve Goddard  , Marcus Völp

 ECRTS outstanding achievement award 2021    
 Gerhard Fohler receives the ECRTS outstanding achievement award for two decades of leadership and services to the conference and the real-time community in general.  

 In 1998, what is now ECRTS used to be a workshop which was about to vanish, when Gerhard Fohler took over as the organizing person and scientific lead behind Euromicro’s real-time systems effort. In the years since then, Gerhard has turned this workshop into a leading conference, maintaining top ranks in several ranking systems (including Core A, CAPES A1, and ASN A, to mention only a few). Gerhard was the driving force behind introducing and implementing many innovations that have since been adopted by many other conferences, including a Work in Progress Poster session, Calls to Action, Artifact Evaluation, Industrial Challenges, and Open-Access proceedings. Without his determination and leadership, ECRTS would not have been what it is now: one of the three top international conferences for promoting state-of-the-art research for real-time systems.  
 It is with deepest gratitude that the real-time community awards the ECRTS outstanding achievement award   to Prof. Dr. Gerhard Fohler in recognition for two decades of leadership and services to the conference and the real-time community in general.

 PDP 2023  
 31st Euromicro International Conference on Parallel, Distributed, and Network-Based Processing  

 Parallel, Distributed, and Network-Based Processing  
 Parallel, Distributed, and Network-Based Processing has undergone impressive change over recent years. New architectures and applications have rapidly become the central focus of the discipline. These changes are often a result of the cross-fertilization of parallel and distributed technologies with other rapidly evolving technologies. Therefore, reviewing and assessing these new developments is paramount compared with recent research achievements in the well-established areas of parallel and distributed computing from industry and the scientific community. PDP 2023 will provide a forum for presenting these and other issues through original research presentations and facilitate the exchange of knowledge and new ideas at the highest technical level. This year's edition is part of the dissemination activities of the ADMIRE project, wich will also be an exhibitor at the conference Demo Area together with E4 Computer Engineering.

 SCALABLE ALGORITHMS, LIBRARIES AND TOOLS FOR COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING ON NEW HETEROGENEOUS HPC SYSTEMS     
   
 Heterogeneity is emerging as one of the main characteristics of today’s and future HPC environments where different node organizations, memory hierarchies, and kinds of exotic accelerators are increasingly present. It pervades the entire spectrum of Computing Continuum, ranging from large Cloud infrastructures and Datacenter up to the Internet of Things and Edge Computing environments, aimed at making available in a transparent and friendly way the multitude of low-power and heterogeneous HPC resources available everywhere around us. In this context, for Computational Science and Machine Learning, it is essential to leverage efficient and highly scalable libraries and tools capable of exploiting such modern heterogeneous computers. These systems are typically characterized by very different software environments, which require a new level of flexibility in the algorithms and methods used to achieve an adequate level of performance, with growing attention to energy consumption. This conference Special Session aims to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss recent advances in parallel methods and algorithms and their implementations on current and future heterogeneous HPC architectures. We solicit research works that address algorithmic design, implementation techniques, performance analysis, integration of parallel numerical methods in science and engineering applications, energy-aware techniques, and theoretical models that efficiently solve problems on heterogeneous platforms.  
 We focus on papers covering various topics of interest that include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 Tools and programming environments support different forms of parallelism. 
  Heterogeneous algorithms for dense and sparse numerical linear algebra 
  Heterogeneous algorithms for optimization and non-linear problems

 CLOUD COMPUTING ON INFRASTRUCTURE AS A SERVICE AND ITS APPLICATIONS     
   
 Cloud Computing covers a broad range of distributed computing principles from infrastructure (e.g distributed storage, reconfigurable networks) to new programming platforms (e.g MS Azure, Google Appe Engine), and internet-based applications. Particularly, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Cloud systems allow the dynamic creation, destruction and management of virtual machines (VMs) as part of virtual computing infrastructures. IaaS Clouds provide a high-level of abstraction to the end user, one that allows the creation of on-demand services through a pay as you go infrastructure combined with elasticity. The increasingly large range of choices and availability of IaaS toolkits has also allowed creation of cloud solutions and frameworks even suitable for private deployment and practical IaaS use on smaller scales.  
 This special session on Cloud Computing is intended to be a forum for the exchange of ideas and experiences on the use of Cloud Computing technologies and applications with compute and data intensive workloads. The special session also aims at presenting the challenges and opportunities offered by the development of open-source Cloud Computing solutions, as well as case studies in applications of Cloud Computing.  
 Authors are invited to submit original and unpublished research in the areas of Cloud Computing, Fog/Edge, Serverless and Distributed Computing. With the rapid evolution of newly emerging technologies, this session also aims to provide a forum for novel methods and case studies on the integrated use of clouds, fogs, Internet of Things (IoT) and Blockchain systems. The general venue will be a good occasion to share, learn, and discuss the latest results in these research fields. The special session program will include presentations of peer-reviewed papers.  
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Cloud Computing for scientific, compute and/or data intensive applications; 
  Virtual Machine scheduling and management algorithms; 
  Operational challenges, federative and interoperability aspects of IaaS systems; 
  Virtual machine/container image and virtual appliance storage management (e.g., caching, repositories, marketplaces); 
  Virtualization and container technologies and their effects on IaaS solutions; 
  Programming models, tools, orchestration techniques, applications, and workflows involving Cloud and IoT systems; 
  Cloud, Edge and Fog services for the Internet of Things; 
  Cloud, Edge, and Fog services for enhanced Blockchain infrastructures; 
  Performance evaluation, modelling, simulation, and prediction of integrated cloud, fog, blockchain and IoT systems; 
  Scalability issues of IoT-Fog-Cloud systems; 
  Security and Privacy aspects of data management in clouds, fogs, blockchain and IoT systems.

 COMPUTE CONTINUUM     
   
 Recently, we are witnessing the growth of Internet-connected devices processing at an incredible pace. Devices that need to be “always-on” for accessing data and services through the network. This massive set of devices generates a lot of pressure on the computing infrastructure that is called to serve their requests. This is particularly critical when focusing on the so-called next-generation applications (NextGen), i.e., those applications characterized by stringent requirements in terms of latency, data, privacy, and network bandwidth. Such a “pressure” stimulates the evolution of classical Cloud computing platforms towards a large-scale distributed computing infrastructure of heterogeneous devices, forming a continuum from the Cloud to the Edge of the network.  
 This complex environment is determining a paradigm switch in the organization of computing infrastructures, moving from “mostly-centralized” to “mostly-decentralized” installments. Rather than relying on a traditional data center compute model, the notion of a compute continuum is gaining momentum, exploiting the right computational resources at optimal processing points in the system.  
 In the traditional cloud model, enterprise data is directed straight to the cloud for processing, where most of the heavy compute intelligence is located. But, in the transformative data-driven era we live in, this is increasingly not a viable long-term economic model due to the volume of data and a new emphasis on security, safety, privacy, latency, and reliability.  
 Today, data insights drive near real-time decisions directly affecting the operation of factories, cities, transportation, buildings, and homes. To cope, computing must be fast, efficient, and secure, which generally means putting more compute firepower closer to the data source. It builds the case for more on-device endpoint computing, more localized computing with a new breed of network and private edge servers, and sensible choices over which workloads need to remain in cloud data centers.  
 The cradle of this special session has been the focus group on the compute continuum that is part of the Italian National Laboratory on “High-Performance Computing: Key Technologies and Tools”, from which this initiative stems. Starting there, the special session aims to bring together experts from academia and industry to identify new challenges for the management of resources in cloud-edge infrastructures and promote this vision to academia and industry stakeholders.  
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 (near-) real-time service management across the compute continuum application models for next-generation continuum-based applications 
  continuum services allocation and orchestration 
  trusted and federated Cloud-Fog-Edge-IoT infrastructures 
  efficient data management and interoperable systems in the compute continuum 
  Mobile Edge Computing 
  Machine Learning for energy saving, scalability and performance improvements targeting the compute continuum 
  efficient simulation of large-scale compute continuum systems 
  domain-specific semantics and languages for the Compute Continuum

 WORKSHOP - BIG DATA CONVERGENCE: FROM SENSORS TO APPLICATIONS     
   
 Abstract  
   The global information technology ecosystem is currently in transition to a new generation of applications, which require intensive systems of acquisition, processing, and data storage, both at the sensor and the computer level. The new scientific applications, more complex, and the increasing availability of data generated by high resolution scientific instruments in domains as diverse as climate, energy, biomedicine, etc., require the synergies between high performance computing (HPC) and large-scale data analysis (Big Data). Today, the HPC world demands Big Data world techniques, while intensive data analysis requires HPC solutions. However, the tools and cultures of HPC and Big Data have diverged because HPC has traditionally focused on strongly coupled intensive computing problems, while Big Data has been geared towards data analysis in highly scalable applications.   
  
 The  overall goal of this workshop  is to create a scientific discussion forum to exchange techniques and experiences to improve the integration of the HPC and Big Data paradigms, providing a convenient way to create software and adapt existing hardware and software intensive in computing and data on an HPC platform. Thus,  this workshop aims at bringing together developers of IoT/edge/Fog/HPC applications with researchers in the field of distributed IT systems  . It addresses researchers who are already employing distributed infrastructure techniques in IoT applications, as well as computer scientists working on the field of distributed systems interested in bringing new developments into the Big Data convergence area.   
 The workshop will provide the opportunity to assess technology roadmaps to support IoT data collection, Data Analytics, and HPC at scale, and to share users’ experiences.   
 A sample of the interest of our proposal is the existence in Europe of a working group for the convergence between HPC and Big Data supported by ETP4HPC and BDVA, led by Prof. María S. Pérez and with the cooperation of several research groups in this proposal. In addition, Prof. Jesús Carretero collaborates in the preparation of the strategic research agenda of the European platform ETP4HPC in the line of data-intensive applications and Dr. Rafael Mayo-García coordinates the European Energy Research Alliance (EERA) transversal Joint Programme ‘Digitalisation for energy’ where convergence research on HPC and Data Science is developed.   
  
 Target audience – why and to whom the workshop is of interest   
 The workshop addresses an audience with two profiles.   
 On the one hand, it attracts researchers who are already employing distributed infrastructure techniques to implement IoT/edge/Fog/Cloud/HPC solutions, in particular scientists who are developing data- and compute-intensive Big Data applications that include IoT data, large-scale IoT networks, and deployments, or complex analysis and machine learning pipelines to exploit the data. On the other hand, it attracts computer scientists working in the field of distributed systems interested in bringing new developments into the convergence of Big Data and HPC solutions.   
  
 Topics of interests   
 Contributions are expected but not restricted to the following topics:   
 Design of architectural frameworks for the integration of HPC and Big Data environments. 
  High Performance Computing Platform for Big Data 
  Architecture modeling and simulation methodologies.

 TUTORIAL - FlexMPI: Malleability Techniques and Applications in High-Performance Computing (E4 & ADMIRE)     

 The current static usage model of HPC systems is becoming increasingly inefficient. This is driven by the continuously growing complexity and heterogeneity of system architectures, in combination with the increased usage of coupled applications, the need for strong scaling with extreme scale parallelism, and the increasing reliance on complex and dynamic workflows. As a consequence, we see a rise in research on malleable systems, middleware software and applications, which can adjust resource usage dynamically in order to extract a maximum of efficiency.   
 Malleability allows systems to dynamically adjust the computation and storage needs of applications, on the one side, and the global system on the other. Such malleable systems, however, face a series of fundamental research challenges, including: who initiates changes in resource availability or usage? How is it communicated? How to compute the optimal usage? How can applications cope with dynamically changing resources? What should malleable programming models and abstractions look like? How to design resource management frameworks for malleable systems? What should be the API for applications?   
 This tutorial will provide an in-depth presentation of emerging software designs to achieve malleability in high-performance computing, high-level parallel programming models, and programmability techniques to improve applications’ malleability. The main part of the tutorial will be devoted to showing and demonstrating FlexMPI, a framework for HPC malleability, and Limitless, an HPC monitoring system to get information from applications and systems and the usage of AI and ML techniques to steer malleability in systems and applications. Finally, we will show how to apply the solutions presented to two use cases: Wacom++ and Nek5000.

 Welcome!  
 Welcome to the 17th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (EACL). Continuing its mission of expanding and involving the science community of all European countries, EACL had selected the Ukrainian community for the 16th EACL, which took place online due to the COVID pandemic. Unfortunately, the ongoing war made the organisation in Kyiv impossible. Considering the importance of physical interaction among researchers, especially after the restrictions imposed by the COVID pandemic, in addition to an online mode, the conference will be held in Dubrovnik, Croatia, from 2 to 6 of May, 2023. The original aim of strengthening the connection with the Ukrainian community will not change as our program will feature a dedicated session and a workshop to highlight work on Ukrainian language technologies. As the flagship European conference in the field of computational linguistics, EACL welcomes European and international researchers covering a broad spectrum of research areas that are concerned with computational approaches to natural language.
