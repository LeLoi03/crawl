Similar to previous years, ACML 2023 has two publication tracks  . Authors may submit either to: 
Conference Track: | (16-page limit with references) for which the proceedings will be published as a volume of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research Workshop and Conference Proceedings (PMLR).
 Journal Track: | (20-page limit with references) for which accepted papers will appear in a special issue of the Springer Machine Learning Journal (MLJ).
 Please note that submission procedures for the two tracks are different. Please read the instructions carefully before submitting.   
Conference Track 
Submission Deadline: June 30, 2023  June 23, 2023   For the conference track, please submit your manuscript via CMT at: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACML2023  . 
IMPORTANT:   When creating a new submission on CMT, please ensure you choose the "Conference"  track. 
The Latex submission template and style file can be found here: ACML2023_submission_template.zip  . 
 The Latex camera-ready template and style file can be found here: ACML2023_camera-ready_template.zip  . 
Manuscripts must be written in English, be a maximum of 16 pages (including references, appendices, etc.) and follow the PMLR style. If required, supplementary material may be submitted as a separate file, but reviewers are not obliged to consider this. 
All conference track submissions must be anonymized  . Submissions that are not anonymized, over-length, or not in the correct format will be rejected without review. To anonymize, simply leave the author information empty in the Tex template. There is no separate format for anonymizing. 
It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g., in arXiv) as long as it is not cited in the submission. 
Journal Track 
Submission Deadline: June 02, 2023  May 26, 2023   In addition to the conference track, this year’s ACML will run a journal track, similar to previous years. Papers that are accepted to the journal track must be presented at the conference in order to be published. 
IMPORTANT:   Similar to previous years, for the journal track, the abstract and the paper must be submitted to two different systems simultaneously   for the purpose of review management: 
First, please submit ONLY the title and abstract via CMT at: | https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACML2023. | (paper manuscript need not be submitted here). When creating the submission on CMT, please choose the | "Journal" | track.
 Then, please submit the paper via Springer’s Editorial Manager system at: | https://www.editorialmanager.com/mach. | When creating a new submission on Springer’s Editorial Manager, please make sure to choose | "S.I.: ACML 2023" | as the article type.
 For the journal track, manuscripts must be written in English with a maximum of 20 pages (including references, appendices, etc.). For the template and style files, please follow the instructions for authors on the journal website: https://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10994  . 
The journal track will follow the reviewing process of the Machine Learning journal. This includes allowing papers that require minor changes to be resubmitted after a first-round review. The journal track committee will aim to complete the reviewing process in time for this year’s conference. In the unlikely event that the reviewing process for a paper is not completed in time (for this year’s conference), the paper will not be considered for the conference and the review will be completed as a regular submission to the Machine Learning journal. 
The journal track review is single-blind, i.e., the authors’ identity will be visible to reviewers. It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. Submissions that are not in the correct format will be rejected without review. In addition, extended versions of published conference papers are not eligible for journal track submission. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g., in arXiv).
14. ACML_3 conference:

Some of our participants are unfortunately facing visa challenges  that might prevent them from joining us in person at the conference. We understand the immense effort and dedication it takes to contribute to ACM Multimedia 2023, and we want to reassure everyone that even if you cannot attend in person due to unforeseen circumstances, your paper will still be featured in the conference proceedings. Our team is dedicated to ensuring a fulfilling and enriching experience for all participants, whether they attend in person or online. We will do our utmost to accommodate any challenges and ensure a satisfactory conference experience for all. 
In addition, we’d like to inform you that your paper will be presented in a 2-minute teaser session for those attending in person. For those who may not be able to make it in person, we will also have 2-minute teaser sessions in separate offline sessions to ensure your research receives the attention it deserves.  
We hope to see as many of you as possible, and we thank you for your understanding.

Make sure to book your hotel stay at the Westin Hotel,  Ottawa conference hotel. The hotel  is at the center of the conference activity, and will allow you to network easily with other conference attendees. Also, it’s a quick trip to get to the program and functions, and just as quick to nip back to your room for a break. Staying at the conference hotel will provide a better conference experience! 
Everyone enjoys meeting in a comfortable conference venue, offering quality service and support for workshops, tutorials, plenary sessions, and other activities. As the transaction for those services and support, the conference guarantees that a percentage of attendees will stay in the hotel. The contract with the hotel then guarantees a specific number of sleeping rooms will be used each night during the conference. If the conference does not meet the contracted sleeping room commitment, the hotel gets paid anyway. Those unfilled rooms will cost the conference thousands of dollars. 
Please support ACMMM 2023 and SIGMM by staying at the Westin Hotel!

AAAI-23 Main Technical Track 
Call for Papers 
 All authors must complete a reproducibility checklist, which facilitates replication of the reported research.
 All authors are expected to be available to review (light load), unless extenuating circumstances apply.
 NeurIPS-22 Fast Track: rejected papers with *final, average* scores of at least 4.9 may be submitted directly into AAAI-23’s Phase 2 along with, for example, previous reviews and paper ID.
 The purpose of the AAAI conference series is to promote research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and foster scientific exchange between researchers, practitioners, scientists, students, and engineers across the entirety of AI and its affiliated disciplines. AAAI-23 is the Thirty-Seventh AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. The theme of this conference is to create collaborative bridges  within and beyond AI. Like previous AAAI conferences, AAAI-23 will feature technical paper presentations, special tracks, invited speakers, workshops, tutorials, poster sessions, senior member presentations, competitions, and exhibit programs, and two new activities: a Bridge Program and a Lab Program. Many of these activities are tailored to the theme of bridges and all are selected according to the highest standards, with additional programs for students and young researchers. 
Driven by its disciplinary diversity, AAAI has incubated numerous AI sub-disciplines and conferences and has nurtured for decades the cohesion of AI. New communities often emerge when two or more disciplines come together in order to explore new opportunities and perspectives; today both are plentiful. The purpose of this year’s Bridge Program is to tap into new sources of innovation by cultivating sustained collaboration between two or more communities, directed towards a common goal. Our interpretation of bridge  is broad and encompasses disciplines both within and outside of AI. Hence, the communities that our Bridge Program is intended to bring together could be distinct subfields of AI, such as planning and learning, or different disciplines that contribute to and benefit from AI, such as AI and the humanities. 
We plan for AAAI-23 to be an in-person conference and are exploring opportunities to complement this with remote participation. Given the volatile situation, however, the exact format of the conference can only be decided at a later stage.

ADCOM 2023: Adaptive, Generative and Bio-inspired AI in Computing and Communication  
The Advanced Computing and Communications Society  (ACCS) in association with the Digital University Kerala  announces the 28th annual International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications  (ADCOM 2023) at Maker Village, Kochi during 8th – 10th December 2023. 
ADCOM, the flagship Systems Conference of the ACCS, is a major annual international meeting that draws leading scientists and researchers in computational and communications engineering from across industry and academia. ADCOM highlights the growing importance of Large-Scale Systems Engineering and provides the platform to share, discuss and witness leading edge research and trends. 
ADCOM 2023 explores the current state-of-art AI covering a broad spectrum of adaptive, generative and bio-inspired algorithms and/or hardware useful in computing and communications. Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can create new content, such as text, images, or other media, from scratch. Generative AI models are trained on large datasets of existing content, and then use this data to learn the patterns and rules that govern how that content is created. Generative AI has a wide range of potential applications in Content creation, Data augmentation, Artificial intelligence assistant, Entertainment, Product design etc.

Call for papers  
The ACM MobiCom conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions in the field of wireless networking and mobile computing. MobiCom solicits papers that address important research challenges and build practical working systems. Successful papers should propose novel ideas to attack such problems through rigorous analysis, system design and real-world measurement or deployment of mobile networks, systems and applications. 
 
 MobiCom’23 will emphasize novelty and creativity while, at the same time, taking a broader and more inclusive view of wireless and mobile systems research. On one hand, the more novel the concept, the harder it can be to fully develop or evaluate all its aspects. On the other hand the more practical and developed the system, the more simple and sometimes known techniques must be leveraged. The review process will take both cases into account as intellectual merit and novelty can be found in techniques, system designs, implementations, and applications. The review process will also favor papers that describe how the authors will provide access to well-documented datasets, modeling and/or simulation tools, and codebases to support the reproducibility of their methods as well as papers that highlight and discuss not only the significance but also the limitations of the work. 
 
 Unlike in previous years, MobiCom’23 will not have separate categories of challenge, experience, and verification papers. However, we do encourage the submission of experience papers as full papers that provide detailed technical insight into real-world deployments of novel technologies and systems. MobiCom'23 will also incorporate early notifications for papers rejected in round 1 and rebuttals as described below in more detail.

 Two Deadlines, Early Notification, Rebuttals, and One-shot Revision 

 MobiCom 2023 offers authors the option of two deadlines and keeps the one-shot revision process to enhance the timeliness and quality of the scientific results from the research community. Each paper will go through the same rigorous reviewing process as in previous MobiCom conferences. The review process for each deadline will involve two rounds. Papers that are not selected to proceed after the first round will receive an early notification, including reviews. After the second round of reviews, the reviews will be released to the authors and who will have one week to submit a rebuttal. 
 
 Rebuttals 
MobiCom will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to the final consideration of the papers at the program committee meeting. Authors must limit their responses to (a) correcting factual errors in the reviews or (b) directly addressing questions posed by reviewers. Responses should be limited to clarifying the submitted work. In particular, responses must not include new experiments, new data, or new figures, describe additional work completed since submission or promise additional work to follow. 
 
 The submission of a rebuttal is optional. Rebuttals will be limited to a maximum of 1000 words submitted in the online submission form. It is worth noting that available reviews will be released at the above-mentioned times. However, additional reviews might be solicited or submitted after the rebuttal period. 
 
 Final decisions will be one of the following 

 Accept | : Accepted papers will be presented at the MobiCom conference and appear as part of the proceedings and the MobiCom website. Note all the papers in this category will initially be | conditionally accepted | . The papers that go through a successful | anonymous | shepherding process will eventually be accepted.
 Reject | : Rejected after reviewed papers cannot be resubmitted until 11 months have passed since the last MobiCom deadline they were submitted to. We strongly encourage the authors to address reviewers' feedback before re-submitting the paper to MobiCom.
 One-Shot-Revision | : Papers, where a revision is required, will be given specific action points and can be resubmitted for the | next | deadline. For such papers, the reviewers will articulate a maximum of three major changes/clarifications that they would like to see. After the resubmission, the paper will be evaluated based on whether the authors have properly addressed the reviewers’ requests. Unlike in the shepherding process, the requested action points may include running additional experiments that obtain specific results and could take more than 4-6 weeks. During this revision period, the paper is still considered under review to MobiCom and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration.
 
 Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers 
The authors of accepted MobiCom 2023 papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee that will assess how well the submitted artifacts support the work described in the accepted papers. Participation in Artifact Evaluation is voluntary and has no influence on the paper’s acceptance, but is strongly encouraged. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive badges printed on the papers themselves. Additional details on the Artifact Evaluation process can be found here. 
 
 Submission Instructions 

 All paper submissions will be handled electronically at the MobiCom ’23 paper submission website  . Authors should prepare a PDF version of their full paper. All submitted papers will be evaluated through a double-blind  reviewing process, with the identities of the authors withheld from the reviewers. 
 
 Before final submission, you are expected to make sure that your paper complies with the following requirements. Please do not violate these requirements with the aim of including additional material: ​submissions that violate the formatting requirements may not be reviewed​.  You can visually inspect a page-by-page report of your paper format using the same tool as the submission system via a separate ​ online form  . After the submission deadline, we will use the same tool to check the conformance of papers. The format checking tool uses heuristics and can make mistakes. The PC chairs will manually inspect and possibly reject those papers with evident format violations. However, no paper will be rejected due to format violations without being manually checked. 
 
 Any papers that do not adhere to the following guidelines may be immediately rejected:

 Real-Time Ray Tracing of Complex Molecular Scenes  

 Real-Time Ray Tracing of Complex Molecular Scenes   
 Abstract  

 Molecular viewing and editing tools are an important part of many applications and processes in  
  structural bioinformatics, computational chemistry, and pharmacy. Consequently, molecular  
  graphics has historically been very fast to adopt the most recent graphics technologies available.  
  Particularly important is providing the user with an accurate (3d) spatial representation of  
  molecular structural arrangements. Another important goal of molecular graphics is to create  
  publication quality images.

 Worst-Case to Expander-Case Reductions   
 Authors:  Amir Abboud and Nathan Wallheimer  
  Abstract    
 In recent years, the expander decomposition method was used to develop many graph algorithms, resulting in major improvements to longstanding complexity barriers. This powerful hammer has led the community to (1) believe that most problems are as easy on worst-case graphs as they are on expanders, and (2) suspect that expander decompositions are the key to breaking the remaining longstanding barriers in fine-grained complexity. We set out to investigate the extent to which these two things are true (and for which problems). Towards this end, we put forth the concept of worst-case to expander-case self-reductions. We design a collection of such reductions for fundamental graph problems, verifying belief (1) for them. The list includes k-Clique, 4-Cycle, Maximum Cardinality Matching, Vertex-Cover, and Minimum Dominating Set. Interestingly, for most (but not all) of these problems the proof is via a simple gadget reduction, not via expander decompositions, showing that this hammer is effectively useless against the problem and contradicting (2).

 Matroid Partition Property and the Secretary Problem   
 Authors:  Dorna Abdolazimi, Anna R. Karlin, Nathan Klein, and Shayan Oveis Gharan  
  Abstract    
 A matroid M on a set E of elements has the α-partition property, for some α > 0, if it is possible to (randomly) construct a partition matroid 𝒫 on (a subset of) elements of M such that every independent set of 𝒫 is independent in M and for any weight function w:E → ℝ_{≥0}, the expected value of the optimum of the matroid secretary problem on 𝒫 is at least an α-fraction of the optimum on M. We show that the complete binary matroid, B_d on 𝔽₂^d does not satisfy the α-partition property for any constant α > 0 (independent of d). Furthermore, we refute a recent conjecture of [Kristóf Bérczi et al., 2021] by showing the same matroid is 2^d/d-colorable but cannot be reduced to an α 2^d/d-colorable partition matroid for any α that is sublinear in d.

 Kolmogorov Complexity Characterizes Statistical Zero Knowledge   
 Authors:  Eric Allender, Shuichi Hirahara, and Harsha Tirumala  
  Abstract    
 We show that a decidable promise problem has a non-interactive statistical zero-knowledge proof system if and only if it is randomly reducible via an honest polynomial-time reduction to a promise problem for Kolmogorov-random strings, with a superlogarithmic additive approximation term. This extends recent work by Saks and Santhanam (CCC 2022). We build on this to give new characterizations of Statistical Zero Knowledge SZK, as well as the related classes NISZK_L and SZK_L.

 Communication Complexity of Inner Product in Symmetric Normed Spaces   
 Authors:  Alexandr Andoni, Jarosław Błasiok, and Arnold Filtser  
  Abstract    
 We introduce and study the communication complexity of computing the inner product of two vectors, where the input is restricted w.r.t. a norm N on the space ℝⁿ. Here, Alice and Bob hold two vectors v,u such that ‖v‖_N ≤ 1 and ‖u‖_{N^*} ≤ 1, where N^* is the dual norm. The goal is to compute their inner product ⟨v,u⟩ up to an ε additive term. The problem is denoted by IP_N, and generalizes important previously studied problems, such as: (1) Computing the expectation 𝔼_{x∼𝒟}[f(x)] when Alice holds 𝒟 and Bob holds f is equivalent to IP_{𝓁₁}. (2) Computing v^TAv where Alice has a symmetric matrix with bounded operator norm (denoted S_∞) and Bob has a vector v where ‖v‖₂ = 1. This problem is complete for quantum communication complexity and is equivalent to IP_{S_∞}. We systematically study IP_N, showing the following results, near tight in most cases: 1) For any symmetric norm N, given ‖v‖_N ≤ 1 and ‖u‖_{N^*} ≤ 1 there is a randomized protocol using 𝒪̃(ε^{-6} log n) bits of communication that returns a value in ⟨u,v⟩±ε with probability 2/3 - we will denote this by ℛ_{ε,1/3}(IP_N) ≤ 𝒪̃(ε^{-6} log n). In a special case where N = 𝓁_p and N^* = 𝓁_q for p^{-1} + q^{-1} = 1, we obtain an improved bound ℛ_{ε,1/3}(IP_{𝓁_p}) ≤ 𝒪(ε^{-2} log n), nearly matching the lower bound ℛ_{ε, 1/3}(IP_{𝓁_p}) ≥ Ω(min(n, ε^{-2})). 2) One way communication complexity ℛ^{→}_{ε,δ}(IP_{𝓁_p}) ≤ 𝒪(ε^{-max(2,p)}⋅ log n/ε), and a nearly matching lower bound ℛ^{→}_{ε, 1/3}(IP_{𝓁_p}) ≥ Ω(ε^{-max(2,p)}) for ε^{-max(2,p)} ≪ n. 3) One way communication complexity ℛ^{→}_{ε,δ}(N) for a symmetric norm N is governed by the distortion of the embedding 𝓁_∞^k into N. Specifically, while a small distortion embedding easily implies a lower bound Ω(k), we show that, conversely, non-existence of such an embedding implies protocol with communication k^𝒪(log log k) log² n. 4) For arbitrary origin symmetric convex polytope P, we show ℛ_{ε,1/3}(IP_{N}) ≤ 𝒪(ε^{-2} log xc(P)), where N is the unique norm for which P is a unit ball, and xc(P) is the extension complexity of P (i.e. the smallest number of inequalities describing some polytope P' s.t. P is projection of P').

 Concentration Bounds for Quantum States and Limitations on the QAOA from Polynomial Approximations   
 Authors:  Anurag Anshu and Tony Metger  
  Abstract    
 We prove concentration bounds for the following classes of quantum states: (i) output states of shallow quantum circuits, answering an open question from [De Palma et al., 2022]; (ii) injective matrix product states; (iii) output states of dense Hamiltonian evolution, i.e. states of the form e^{ιH^{(p)}} ⋯ e^{ιH^{(1)}} |ψ₀⟩ for any n-qubit product state |ψ₀⟩, where each H^{(i)} can be any local commuting Hamiltonian satisfying a norm constraint, including dense Hamiltonians with interactions between any qubits. Our proofs use polynomial approximations to show that these states are close to local operators. This implies that the distribution of the Hamming weight of a computational basis measurement (and of other related observables) concentrates. An example of (iii) are the states produced by the quantum approximate optimisation algorithm (QAOA). Using our concentration results for these states, we show that for a random spin model, the QAOA can only succeed with negligible probability even at super-constant level p = o(log log n), assuming a strengthened version of the so-called overlap gap property. This gives the first limitations on the QAOA on dense instances at super-constant level, improving upon the recent result [Basso et al., 2022].

 On Identity Testing and Noncommutative Rank Computation over the Free Skew Field   
 Authors:  V. Arvind, Abhranil Chatterjee, Utsab Ghosal, Partha Mukhopadhyay, and C. Ramya  
  Abstract    
 The identity testing of rational formulas (RIT) in the free skew field efficiently reduces to computing the rank of a matrix whose entries are linear polynomials in noncommuting variables [Hrubeš and Wigderson, 2015]. This rank computation problem has deterministic polynomial-time white-box algorithms [Ankit Garg et al., 2016; Ivanyos et al., 2018] and a randomized polynomial-time algorithm in the black-box setting [Harm Derksen and Visu Makam, 2017]. In this paper, we propose a new approach for efficient derandomization of black-box RIT. Additionally, we obtain results for matrix rank computation over the free skew field and construct efficient linear pencil representations for a new class of rational expressions. More precisely, we show: - Under the hardness assumption that the ABP (algebraic branching program) complexity of every polynomial identity for the k×k matrix algebra is 2^Ω(k) [Andrej Bogdanov and Hoeteck Wee, 2005], we obtain a subexponential-time black-box RIT algorithm for rational formulas of inversion height almost logarithmic in the size of the formula. This can be seen as the first "hardness implies derandomization" type theorem for rational formulas. - We show that the noncommutative rank of any matrix over the free skew field whose entries have small linear pencil representations can be computed in deterministic polynomial time. While an efficient rank computation was known for matrices with noncommutative formulas as entries [Ankit Garg et al., 2020], we obtain the first deterministic polynomial-time algorithms for rank computation of matrices whose entries are noncommutative ABPs or rational formulas. - Motivated by the definition given by Bergman [George M Bergman, 1976], we define a new class of rational functions where a rational function of inversion height at most h is defined as a composition of a noncommutative r-skewed circuit (equivalently an ABP) with inverses of rational functions of this class of inversion height at most h-1 which are also disjoint. We obtain a polynomial-size linear pencil representation for this class which gives a white-box deterministic polynomial-time identity testing algorithm for the class.

 All-Norm Load Balancing in Graph Streams via the Multiplicative Weights Update Method   
 Authors:  Sepehr Assadi, Aaron Bernstein, and Zachary Langley  
  Abstract    
 In the weighted load balancing problem, the input is an n-vertex bipartite graph between a set of clients and a set of servers, and each client comes with some nonnegative real weight. The output is an assignment that maps each client to one of its adjacent servers, and the load of a server is then the sum of the weights of the clients assigned to it. The goal is to find an assignment that is well-balanced, typically captured by (approximately) minimizing either the 𝓁_∞- or 𝓁₂-norm of the server loads. Generalizing both of these objectives, the all-norm load balancing problem asks for an assignment that approximately minimizes all 𝓁_p-norm objectives for p ≥ 1, including p = ∞, simultaneously. Our main result is a deterministic O(log n)-pass O(1)-approximation semi-streaming algorithm for the all-norm load balancing problem. Prior to our work, only an O(log n)-pass O(log n)-approximation algorithm for the 𝓁_∞-norm objective was known in the semi-streaming setting. Our algorithm uses a novel application of the multiplicative weights update method to a mixed covering/packing convex program for the all-norm load balancing problem involving an infinite number of constraints.

 A Framework for Adversarial Streaming via Differential Privacy and Difference Estimators   
 Authors:  Idan Attias, Edith Cohen, Moshe Shechner, and Uri Stemmer  
  Abstract    
 Classical streaming algorithms operate under the (not always reasonable) assumption that the input stream is fixed in advance. Recently, there is a growing interest in designing robust streaming algorithms that provide provable guarantees even when the input stream is chosen adaptively as the execution progresses. We propose a new framework for robust streaming that combines techniques from two recently suggested frameworks by Hassidim et al. [NeurIPS 2020] and by Woodruff and Zhou [FOCS 2021]. These recently suggested frameworks rely on very different ideas, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. We combine these two frameworks into a single hybrid framework that obtains the "best of both worlds", thereby solving a question left open by Woodruff and Zhou.

 Making Auctions Robust to Aftermarkets   
 Authors:  Moshe Babaioff, Nicole Immorlica, Yingkai Li, and Brendan Lucier  
  Abstract    
 A prevalent assumption in auction theory is that the auctioneer has full control over the market and that the allocation she dictates is final. In practice, however, agents might be able to resell acquired items in an aftermarket. A prominent example is the market for carbon emission allowances. These allowances are commonly allocated by the government using uniform-price auctions, and firms can typically trade these allowances among themselves in an aftermarket that may not be fully under the auctioneer’s control. While the uniform-price auction is approximately efficient in isolation, we show that speculation and resale in aftermarkets might result in a significant welfare loss. Motivated by this issue, we consider three approaches, each ensuring high equilibrium welfare in the combined market. The first approach is to adopt smooth auctions such as discriminatory auctions. This approach is robust to correlated valuations and to participants acquiring information about others' types. However, discriminatory auctions have several downsides, notably that of charging bidders different prices for identical items, resulting in fairness concerns that make the format unpopular. Two other approaches we suggest are either using posted-pricing mechanisms, or using uniform-price auctions with anonymous reserves. We show that when using balanced prices, both these approaches ensure high equilibrium welfare in the combined market. The latter also inherits many of the benefits from uniform-price auctions such as price discovery, and can be introduced with a minor modification to auctions currently in use to sell carbon emission allowances.

 Efficiently Testable Circuits   
 Authors:  Mirza Ahad Baig, Suvradip Chakraborty, Stefan Dziembowski, Małgorzata Gałązka, Tomasz Lizurej, and Krzysztof Pietrzak  
  Abstract    
 In this work, we put forward the notion of "efficiently testable circuits" and provide circuit compilers that transform any circuit into an efficiently testable one. Informally, a circuit is testable if one can detect tampering with the circuit by evaluating it on a small number of inputs from some test set. Our technical contribution is a compiler that transforms any circuit C into a testable circuit (Ĉ,𝕋̂) for which we can detect arbitrary tampering with all wires in Ĉ. The notion of a testable circuit is weaker or incomparable to existing notions of tamper-resilience, which aim to detect or even correct for errors introduced by tampering during every query, but our new notion is interesting in several settings, and we achieve security against much more general tampering classes - like tampering with all wires - with very modest overhead. Concretely, starting from a circuit C of size n and depth d, for any L (think of L as a small constant, say L = 4), we get a testable (Ĉ,𝕋̂) where Ĉ is of size ≈ 12n and depth d+log(n)+L⋅ n^{1/L}. The test set 𝕋̂ is of size 4⋅ 2^L. The number of extra input and output wires (i.e., pins) we need to add for the testing is 3+L and 2^L, respectively.

 Strategyproof Scheduling with Predictions   
 Authors:  Eric Balkanski, Vasilis Gkatzelis, and Xizhi Tan  
  Abstract    
 In their seminal paper that initiated the field of algorithmic mechanism design, Nisan and Ronen [Noam Nisan and Amir Ronen, 1999] studied the problem of designing strategyproof mechanisms for scheduling jobs on unrelated machines aiming to minimize the makespan. They provided a strategyproof mechanism that achieves an n-approximation and they made the bold conjecture that this is the best approximation achievable by any deterministic strategyproof scheduling mechanism. After more than two decades and several efforts, n remains the best known approximation and very recent work by Christodoulou et al. [George Christodoulou et al., 2021] has been able to prove an Ω(√n) approximation lower bound for all deterministic strategyproof mechanisms. This strong negative result, however, heavily depends on the fact that the performance of these mechanisms is evaluated using worst-case analysis. To overcome such overly pessimistic, and often uninformative, worst-case bounds, a surge of recent work has focused on the "learning-augmented framework", whose goal is to leverage machine-learned predictions to obtain improved approximations when these predictions are accurate (consistency), while also achieving near-optimal worst-case approximations even when the predictions are arbitrarily wrong (robustness). In this work, we study the classic strategic scheduling problem of Nisan and Ronen [Noam Nisan and Amir Ronen, 1999] using the learning-augmented framework and give a deterministic polynomial-time strategyproof mechanism that is 6-consistent and 2n-robust. We thus achieve the "best of both worlds": an O(1) consistency and an O(n) robustness that asymptotically matches the best-known approximation. We then extend this result to provide more general worst-case approximation guarantees as a function of the prediction error. Finally, we complement our positive results by showing that any 1-consistent deterministic strategyproof mechanism has unbounded robustness.

 Graph Searching with Predictions   
 Authors:  Siddhartha Banerjee, Vincent Cohen-Addad, Anupam Gupta, and Zhouzi Li  
  Abstract    
 Consider an agent exploring an unknown graph in search of some goal state. As it walks around the graph, it learns the nodes and their neighbors. The agent only knows where the goal state is when it reaches it. How do we reach this goal while moving only a small distance? This problem seems hopeless, even on trees of bounded degree, unless we give the agent some help. This setting with "help" often arises in exploring large search spaces (e.g., huge game trees) where we assume access to some score/quality function for each node, which we use to guide us towards the goal. In our case, we assume the help comes in the form of distance predictions: each node v provides a prediction f(v) of its distance to the goal vertex. Naturally if these predictions are correct, we can reach the goal along a shortest path. What if the predictions are unreliable and some of them are erroneous? Can we get an algorithm whose performance relates to the error of the predictions? In this work, we consider the problem on trees and give deterministic algorithms whose total movement cost is only O(OPT + Δ ⋅ ERR), where OPT is the distance from the start to the goal vertex, Δ the maximum degree, and the ERR is the total number of vertices whose predictions are erroneous. We show this guarantee is optimal. We then consider a "planning" version of the problem where the graph and predictions are known at the beginning, so the agent can use this global information to devise a search strategy of low cost. For this planning version, we go beyond trees and give an algorithms which gets good performance on (weighted) graphs with bounded doubling dimension.

 On Computing Homological Hitting Sets   
 Authors:  Ulrich Bauer, Abhishek Rathod, and Meirav Zehavi  
  Abstract    
 Cut problems form one of the most fundamental classes of problems in algorithmic graph theory. In this paper, we initiate the algorithmic study of a high-dimensional cut problem. The problem we study, namely, Homological Hitting Set (HHS), is defined as follows: Given a nontrivial r-cycle z in a simplicial complex, find a set 𝒮 of r-dimensional simplices of minimum cardinality so that 𝒮 meets every cycle homologous to z. Our first result is that HHS admits a polynomial-time solution on triangulations of closed surfaces. Interestingly, the minimal solution is given in terms of the cocycles of the surface. Next, we provide an example of a 2-complex for which the (unique) minimal hitting set is not a cocycle. Furthermore, for general complexes, we show that HHS is W[1]-hard with respect to the solution size p. In contrast, on the positive side, we show that HHS admits an FPT algorithm with respect to p+Δ, where Δ is the maximum degree of the Hasse graph of the complex 𝖪.

 On Disperser/Lifting Properties of the Index and Inner-Product Functions   
 Authors:  Paul Beame and Sajin Koroth  
  Abstract    
 Query-to-communication lifting theorems, which connect the query complexity of a Boolean function to the communication complexity of an associated "lifted" function obtained by composing the function with many copies of another function known as a gadget, have been instrumental in resolving many open questions in computational complexity. A number of important complexity questions could be resolved if we could make substantial improvements in the input size required for lifting with the Index function, which is a universal gadget for lifting, from its current near-linear size down to polylogarithmic in the number of inputs N of the original function or, ideally, constant. The near-linear size bound was recently shown by Lovett, Meka, Mertz, Pitassi and Zhang [Shachar Lovett et al., 2022] using a recent breakthrough improvement on the Sunflower Lemma to show that a certain graph associated with an Index function of that size is a disperser. They also stated a conjecture about the Index function that is essential for further improvements in the size required for lifting with Index using current techniques. In this paper we prove the following; - The conjecture of Lovett et al. is false when the size of the Index gadget is less than logarithmic in N. - The same limitation applies to the Inner-Product function. More precisely, the Inner-Product function, which is known to satisfy the disperser property at size O(log N), also does not have this property when its size is less than log N. - Notwithstanding the above, we prove a lifting theorem that applies to Index gadgets of any size at least 4 and yields lower bounds for a restricted class of communication protocols in which one of the players is limited to sending parities of its inputs. - Using a modification of the same idea with improved lifting parameters we derive a strong lifting theorem from decision tree size to parity decision tree size. We use this, in turn, to derive a general lifting theorem in proof complexity from tree-resolution size to tree-like Res(⊕) refutation size, which yields many new exponential lower bounds on such proofs.

 Is This Correct? Let’s Check!   
 Authors:  Omri Ben-Eliezer, Dan Mikulincer, Elchanan Mossel, and Madhu Sudan  
  Abstract    
 Societal accumulation of knowledge is a complex process. The correctness of new units of knowledge depends not only on the correctness of new reasoning, but also on the correctness of old units that the new one builds on. The errors in such accumulation processes are often remedied by error correction and detection heuristics. Motivating examples include the scientific process based on scientific publications, and software development based on libraries of code. Natural processes that aim to keep errors under control, such as peer review in scientific publications, and testing and debugging in software development, would typically check existing pieces of knowledge - both for the reasoning that generated them and the previous facts they rely on. In this work, we present a simple process that models such accumulation of knowledge and study the persistence (or lack thereof) of errors. We consider a simple probabilistic model for the generation of new units of knowledge based on the preferential attachment growth model, which additionally allows for errors. Furthermore, the process includes checks aimed at catching these errors. We investigate when effects of errors persist forever in the system (with positive probability) and when they get rooted out completely by the checking process. The two basic parameters associated with the checking process are the probability of conducting a check and the depth of the check. We show that errors are rooted out if checks are sufficiently frequent and sufficiently deep. In contrast, shallow or infrequent checks are insufficient to root out errors.

 Online Learning and Bandits with Queried Hints   
 Authors:  Aditya Bhaskara, Sreenivas Gollapudi, Sungjin Im, Kostas Kollias, and Kamesh Munagala  
  Abstract    
 We consider the classic online learning and stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems, when at each step, the online policy can probe and find out which of a small number (k) of choices has better reward (or loss) before making its choice. In this model, we derive algorithms whose regret bounds have exponentially better dependence on the time horizon compared to the classic regret bounds. In particular, we show that probing with k = 2 suffices to achieve time-independent regret bounds for online linear and convex optimization. The same number of probes improve the regret bound of stochastic MAB with independent arms from O(√{nT}) to O(n² log T), where n is the number of arms and T is the horizon length. For stochastic MAB, we also consider a stronger model where a probe reveals the reward values of the probed arms, and show that in this case, k = 3 probes suffice to achieve parameter-independent constant regret, O(n²). Such regret bounds cannot be achieved even with full feedback after the play, showcasing the power of limited "advice" via probing before making the play. We also present extensions to the setting where the hints can be imperfect, and to the case of stochastic MAB where the rewards of the arms can be correlated.

 Bootstrapping Homomorphic Encryption via Functional Encryption   
 Authors:  Nir Bitansky and Tomer Solomon  
  Abstract    
 Homomorphic encryption is a central object in modern cryptography, with far-reaching applications. Constructions supporting homomorphic evaluation of arbitrary Boolean circuits have been known for over a decade, based on standard lattice assumptions. However, these constructions are leveled, meaning that they only support circuits up to some a-priori bounded depth. These leveled constructions can be bootstrapped into fully homomorphic ones, but this requires additional circular security assumptions, which are construction-dependent, and where reductions to standard lattice assumptions are no longer known. Alternative constructions are known based on indistinguishability obfuscation, which has been recently constructed under standard assumptions. However, this alternative requires subexponential hardness of the underlying primitives. We prove a new bootstrapping theorem based on functional encryption, which is known based on standard polynomial hardness assumptions. As a result we obtain the first fully homomorphic encryption scheme that avoids both circular security assumptions and super-polynomial hardness assumptions. The construction is secure against uniform adversaries, and can be made non-uniformly secure assuming a generalization of the time-hierarchy theorem, which follows for example from non-uniform ETH. At the heart of the construction is a new proof technique based on cryptographic puzzles and decomposable obfuscation. Unlike most cryptographic reductions, our security reduction does not fully treat the adversary as a black box, but rather makes explicit use of its running time (or circuit size).

 Certification with an NP Oracle   
 Authors:  Guy Blanc, Caleb Koch, Jane Lange, Carmen Strassle, and Li-Yang Tan  
  Abstract    
 In the certification problem, the algorithm is given a function f with certificate complexity k and an input x^⋆, and the goal is to find a certificate of size ≤ poly(k) for f’s value at x^⋆. This problem is in NP^NP, and assuming 𝖯 ≠ NP, is not in 𝖯. Prior works, dating back to Valiant in 1984, have therefore sought to design efficient algorithms by imposing assumptions on f such as monotonicity. Our first result is a BPP^NP algorithm for the general problem. The key ingredient is a new notion of the balanced influence of variables, a natural variant of influence that corrects for the bias of the function. Balanced influences can be accurately estimated via uniform generation, and classic BPP^NP algorithms are known for the latter task. We then consider certification with stricter instance-wise guarantees: for each x^⋆, find a certificate whose size scales with that of the smallest certificate for x^⋆. In sharp contrast with our first result, we show that this problem is NP^NP-hard even to approximate. We obtain an optimal inapproximability ratio, adding to a small handful of problems in the higher levels of the polynomial hierarchy for which optimal inapproximability is known. Our proof involves the novel use of bit-fixing dispersers for gap amplification.

 Matrix Multiplication via Matrix Groups   
 Authors:  Jonah Blasiak, Henry Cohn, Joshua A. Grochow, Kevin Pratt, and Chris Umans  
  Abstract    
 In 2003, Cohn and Umans proposed a group-theoretic approach to bounding the exponent of matrix multiplication. Previous work within this approach ruled out certain families of groups as a route to obtaining ω = 2, while other families of groups remain potentially viable. In this paper we turn our attention to matrix groups, whose usefulness within this framework was relatively unexplored. We first show that groups of Lie type cannot prove ω = 2 within the group-theoretic approach. This is based on a representation-theoretic argument that identifies the second-smallest dimension of an irreducible representation of a group as a key parameter that determines its viability in this framework. Our proof builds on Gowers' result concerning product-free sets in quasirandom groups. We then give another barrier that rules out certain natural matrix group constructions that make use of subgroups that are far from being self-normalizing. Our barrier results leave open several natural paths to obtain ω = 2 via matrix groups. To explore these routes we propose working in the continuous setting of Lie groups, in which we develop an analogous theory. Obtaining the analogue of ω = 2 in this potentially easier setting is a key challenge that represents an intermediate goal short of actually proving ω = 2. We give two constructions in the continuous setting, each of which evades one of our two barriers.

 Epic Fail: Emulators Can Tolerate Polynomially Many Edge Faults for Free   
 Authors:  Greg Bodwin, Michael Dinitz, and Yasamin Nazari  
  Abstract    
 A t-emulator of a graph G is a graph H that approximates its pairwise shortest path distances up to multiplicative t error. We study fault tolerant t-emulators, under the model recently introduced by Bodwin, Dinitz, and Nazari [ITCS 2022] for vertex failures. In this paper we consider the version for edge failures, and show that they exhibit surprisingly different behavior. In particular, our main result is that, for (2k-1)-emulators with k odd, we can tolerate a polynomial number of edge faults for free. For example: for any n-node input graph, we construct a 5-emulator (k = 3) on O(n^{4/3}) edges that is robust to f = O(n^{2/9}) edge faults. It is well known that Ω(n^{4/3}) edges are necessary even if the 5-emulator does not need to tolerate any faults. Thus we pay no extra cost in the size to gain this fault tolerance. We leave open the precise range of free fault tolerance for odd k, and whether a similar phenomenon can be proved for even k.

 Opponent Indifference in Rating Systems: A Theoretical Case for Sonas   
 Authors:  Greg Bodwin and Forest Zhang  
  Abstract    
 In competitive games, it is common to assign each player a real number rating signifying their skill level. A rating system is a procedure by which player ratings are adjusted upwards each time they win, or downwards each time they lose. Many matchmaking systems give players some control over their opponent’s rating; for example, a player might be able to selectively initiate games against opponents whose ratings are publicly visible, or abort a game without penalty before it begins but after glimpsing their opponent’s rating. It is natural to ask whether one can design a rating system that does not incentivize a rating-maximizing player to act strategically, seeking games against opponents of one rating over another. We show the following: - The full version of this "opponent indifference" property is unfortunately too strong to be feasible. Although it is satisfied by some rating systems, these systems lack certain desirable expressiveness properties, suggesting that they are not suitable to capture most games of interest. - However, there is a natural relaxation, roughly requiring indifference between any two opponents who are both "reasonably evenly matched" with the choosing player. We prove that this relaxed variant of opponent indifference, which we call P opponent indifference, is viable. In fact, a certain strong version of P opponent indifference precisely characterizes the rating system Sonas, which was originally proposed for its empirical predictive accuracy on the outcomes of high-level chess games.

 PPP-Completeness and Extremal Combinatorics   
 Authors:  Romain Bourneuf, Lukáš Folwarczný, Pavel Hubáček, Alon Rosen, and Nikolaj I. Schwartzbach  
  Abstract    
 Many classical theorems in combinatorics establish the emergence of substructures within sufficiently large collections of objects. Well-known examples are Ramsey’s theorem on monochromatic subgraphs and the Erdős-Rado sunflower lemma. Implicit versions of the corresponding total search problems are known to be PWPP-hard under randomized reductions in the case of Ramsey’s theorem and PWPP-hard in the case of the sunflower lemma; here "implicit” means that the collection is represented by a poly-sized circuit inducing an exponentially large number of objects. We show that several other well-known theorems from extremal combinatorics - including Erdős-Ko-Rado, Sperner, and Cayley’s formula – give rise to complete problems for PWPP and PPP. This is in contrast to the Ramsey and Erdős-Rado problems, for which establishing inclusion in PWPP has remained elusive. Besides significantly expanding the set of problems that are complete for PWPP and PPP, our work identifies some key properties of combinatorial proofs of existence that can give rise to completeness for these classes. Our completeness results rely on efficient encodings for which finding collisions allows extracting the desired substructure. These encodings are made possible by the tightness of the bounds for the problems at hand (tighter than what is known for Ramsey’s theorem and the sunflower lemma). Previous techniques for proving bounds in TFNP invariably made use of structured algorithms. Such algorithms are not known to exist for the theorems considered in this work, as their proofs "from the book" are non-constructive.

 On Low-End Obfuscation and Learning   
 Authors:  Elette Boyle, Yuval Ishai, Pierre Meyer, Robert Robere, and Gal Yehuda  
  Abstract    
 Most recent works on cryptographic obfuscation focus on the high-end regime of obfuscating general circuits while guaranteeing computational indistinguishability between functionally equivalent circuits. Motivated by the goals of simplicity and efficiency, we initiate a systematic study of "low-end" obfuscation, focusing on simpler representation models and information-theoretic notions of security. We obtain the following results. - Positive results via "white-box" learning. We present a general technique for obtaining perfect indistinguishability obfuscation from exact learning algorithms that are given restricted access to the representation of the input function. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by obtaining simple obfuscation for decision trees and multilinear read-k arithmetic formulas. - Negative results via PAC learning. A proper obfuscation scheme obfuscates programs from a class C by programs from the same class. Assuming the existence of one-way functions, we show that there is no proper indistinguishability obfuscation scheme for k-CNF formulas for any constant k ≥ 3; in fact, even obfuscating 3-CNF by k-CNF is impossible. This result applies even to computationally secure obfuscation, and makes an unexpected use of PAC learning in the context of negative results for obfuscation. - Separations. We study the relations between different information-theoretic notions of indistinguishability obfuscation, giving cryptographic evidence for separations between them.

 On the Computational Hardness Needed for Quantum Cryptography   
 Authors:  Zvika Brakerski, Ran Canetti, and Luowen Qian  
  Abstract    
 In the classical model of computation, it is well established that one-way functions (OWF) are minimal for computational cryptography: They are essential for almost any cryptographic application that cannot be realized with respect to computationally unbounded adversaries. In the quantum setting, however, OWFs appear not to be essential (Kretschmer 2021; Ananth et al., Morimae and Yamakawa 2022), and the question of whether such a minimal primitive exists remains open. We consider EFI pairs - efficiently samplable, statistically far but computationally indistinguishable pairs of (mixed) quantum states. Building on the work of Yan (2022), which shows equivalence between EFI pairs and statistical commitment schemes, we show that EFI pairs are necessary for a large class of quantum-cryptographic applications. Specifically, we construct EFI pairs from minimalistic versions of commitments schemes, oblivious transfer, and general secure multiparty computation, as well as from QCZK proofs from essentially any non-trivial language. We also construct quantum computational zero knowledge (QCZK) proofs for all of QIP from any EFI pair. This suggests that, for much of quantum cryptography, EFI pairs play a similar role to that played by OWFs in the classical setting: they are simple to describe, essential, and also serve as a linchpin for demonstrating equivalence between primitives.

 Improved Monotonicity Testers via Hypercube Embeddings   
 Authors:  Mark Braverman, Subhash Khot, Guy Kindler, and Dor Minzer  
  Abstract    
 We show improved monotonicity testers for the Boolean hypercube under the p-biased measure, as well as over the hypergrid [m]ⁿ. Our results are: 1) For any p ∈ (0,1), for the p-biased hypercube we show a non-adaptive tester that makes Õ(√n/ε²) queries, accepts monotone functions with probability 1 and rejects functions that are ε-far from monotone with probability at least 2/3. 2) For all m ∈ ℕ, we show an Õ(√nm³/ε²) query monotonicity tester over [m]ⁿ. We also establish corresponding directed isoperimetric inequalities in these domains, analogous to the isoperimetric inequality in [Subhash Khot et al., 2018]. Previously, the best known tester due to Black, Chakrabarty and Seshadhri [Hadley Black et al., 2018] had Ω(n^{5/6}) query complexity. Our results are optimal up to poly-logarithmic factors and the dependency on m. Our proof uses a notion of monotone embeddings of measures into the Boolean hypercube that can be used to reduce the problem of monotonicity testing over an arbitrary product domains to the Boolean cube. The embedding maps a function over a product domain of dimension n into a function over a Boolean cube of a larger dimension n', while preserving its distance from being monotone; an embedding is considered efficient if n' is not much larger than n, and we show how to construct efficient embeddings in the above mentioned settings.

 Rounding via Low Dimensional Embeddings   
 Authors:  Mark Braverman and Dor Minzer  
  Abstract    
 A regular graph G = (V,E) is an (ε,γ) small-set expander if for any set of vertices of fractional size at most ε, at least γ of the edges that are adjacent to it go outside. In this paper, we give a unified approach to several known complexity-theoretic results on small-set expanders. In particular, we show: 1) Max-Cut: we show that if a regular graph G = (V,E) is an (ε,γ) small-set expander that contains a cut of fractional size at least 1-δ, then one can find in G a cut of fractional size at least 1-O(δ/(εγ⁶)) in polynomial time. 2) Improved spectral partitioning, Cheeger’s inequality and the parallel repetition theorem over small-set expanders. The general form of each one of these results involves square-root loss that comes from certain rounding procedure, and we show how this can be avoided over small set expanders. Our main idea is to project a high dimensional vector solution into a low-dimensional space while roughly maintaining 𝓁₂² distances, and then perform a pre-processing step using low-dimensional geometry and the properties of 𝓁₂² distances over it. This pre-processing leverages the small-set expansion property of the graph to transform a vector valued solution to a different vector valued solution with additional structural properties, which give rise to more efficient integral-solution rounding schemes.

 Counting Subgraphs in Somewhere Dense Graphs   
 Authors:  Marco Bressan, Leslie Ann Goldberg, Kitty Meeks, and Marc Roth  
  Abstract    
 We study the problems of counting copies and induced copies of a small pattern graph H in a large host graph G. Recent work fully classified the complexity of those problems according to structural restrictions on the patterns H. In this work, we address the more challenging task of analysing the complexity for restricted patterns and restricted hosts. Specifically we ask which families of allowed patterns and hosts imply fixed-parameter tractability, i.e., the existence of an algorithm running in time f(H)⋅|G|^O(1) for some computable function f. Our main results present exhaustive and explicit complexity classifications for families that satisfy natural closure properties. Among others, we identify the problems of counting small matchings and independent sets in subgraph-closed graph classes 𝒢 as our central objects of study and establish the following crisp dichotomies as consequences of the Exponential Time Hypothesis: - Counting k-matchings in a graph G ∈ 𝒢 is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if 𝒢 is nowhere dense. - Counting k-independent sets in a graph G ∈ 𝒢 is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if 𝒢 is nowhere dense. Moreover, we obtain almost tight conditional lower bounds if 𝒢 is somewhere dense, i.e., not nowhere dense. These base cases of our classifications subsume a wide variety of previous results on the matching and independent set problem, such as counting k-matchings in bipartite graphs (Curticapean, Marx; FOCS 14), in F-colourable graphs (Roth, Wellnitz; SODA 20), and in degenerate graphs (Bressan, Roth; FOCS 21), as well as counting k-independent sets in bipartite graphs (Curticapean et al.; Algorithmica 19). At the same time our proofs are much simpler: using structural characterisations of somewhere dense graphs, we show that a colourful version of a recent breakthrough technique for analysing pattern counting problems (Curticapean, Dell, Marx; STOC 17) applies to any subgraph-closed somewhere dense class of graphs, yielding a unified view of our current understanding of the complexity of subgraph counting.

 Rigidity for Monogamy-Of-Entanglement Games   
 Authors:  Anne Broadbent and Eric Culf  
  Abstract    
 In a monogamy-of-entanglement (MoE) game, two players who do not communicate try to simultaneously guess a referee’s measurement outcome on a shared quantum state they prepared. We study the prototypical example of a game where the referee measures in either the computational or Hadamard basis and informs the players of her choice. We show that this game satisfies a rigidity property similar to what is known for some nonlocal games. That is, in order to win optimally, the players' strategy must be of a specific form, namely a convex combination of four unentangled optimal strategies generated by the Breidbart state. We extend this to show that strategies that win near-optimally must also be near an optimal state of this form. We also show rigidity for multiple copies of the game played in parallel. We give three applications: (1) We construct for the first time a weak string erasure (WSE) scheme where the security does not rely on limitations on the parties' hardware. Instead, we add a prover, which enables security via the rigidity of this MoE game. (2) We show that the WSE scheme can be used to achieve bit commitment in a model where it is impossible classically. (3) We achieve everlasting-secure randomness expansion in the model of trusted but leaky measurement and untrusted preparation and measurements by two isolated devices, while relying only on the temporary assumption of pseudorandom functions. This achieves randomness expansion without the need for shared entanglement.

 Quantum Majority Vote   
 Authors:  Harry Buhrman, Noah Linden, Laura Mančinska, Ashley Montanaro, and Maris Ozols  
  Abstract    
 Majority vote is a basic method for amplifying correct outcomes that is widely used in computer science and beyond. While it can amplify the correctness of a quantum device with classical output, the analogous procedure for quantum output is not known. We introduce quantum majority vote as the following task: given a product state |ψ_1⟩ ⊗ … ⊗ |ψ_n⟩ where each qubit is in one of two orthogonal states |ψ⟩ or |ψ^⟂⟩, output the majority state. We show that an optimal algorithm for this problem achieves worst-case fidelity of 1/2 + Θ(1/√n). Under the promise that at least 2/3 of the input qubits are in the majority state, the fidelity increases to 1 - Θ(1/n) and approaches 1 as n increases. We also consider the more general problem of computing any symmetric and equivariant Boolean function f: {0,1}ⁿ → {0,1} in an unknown quantum basis, and show that a generalization of our quantum majority vote algorithm is optimal for this task. The optimal parameters for the generalized algorithm and its worst-case fidelity can be determined by a simple linear program of size O(n). The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n⁴ log n) where n is the number of input qubits.

 TFNP Characterizations of Proof Systems and Monotone Circuits   
 Authors:  Sam Buss, Noah Fleming, and Russell Impagliazzo  
  Abstract    
 Connections between proof complexity and circuit complexity have become major tools for obtaining lower bounds in both areas. These connections - which take the form of interpolation theorems and query-to-communication lifting theorems - translate efficient proofs into small circuits, and vice versa, allowing tools from one area to be applied to the other. Recently, the theory of TFNP has emerged as a unifying framework underlying these connections. For many of the proof systems which admit such a connection there is a TFNP problem which characterizes it: the class of problems which are reducible to this TFNP problem via query-efficient reductions is equivalent to the tautologies that can be efficiently proven in the system. Through this, proof complexity has become a major tool for proving separations in black-box TFNP. Similarly, for certain monotone circuit models, the class of functions that it can compute efficiently is equivalent to what can be reduced to a certain TFNP problem in a communication-efficient manner. When a TFNP problem has both a proof and circuit characterization, one can prove an interpolation theorem. Conversely, many lifting theorems can be viewed as relating the communication and query reductions to TFNP problems. This is exciting, as it suggests that TFNP provides a roadmap for the development of further interpolation theorems and lifting theorems. In this paper we begin to develop a more systematic understanding of when these connections to TFNP occur. We give exact conditions under which a proof system or circuit model admits a characterization by a TFNP problem. We show: - Every well-behaved proof system which can prove its own soundness (a reflection principle) is characterized by a TFNP problem. Conversely, every TFNP problem gives rise to a well-behaved proof system which proves its own soundness. - Every well-behaved monotone circuit model which admits a universal family of functions is characterized by a TFNP problem. Conversely, every TFNP problem gives rise to a well-behaved monotone circuit model with a universal problem. As an example, we provide a TFNP characterization of the Polynomial Calculus, answering a question from [Mika Göös et al., 2022], and show that it can prove its own soundness.

 Clustering Permutations: New Techniques with Streaming Applications   
 Authors:  Diptarka Chakraborty, Debarati Das, and Robert Krauthgamer  
  Abstract    
 We study the classical metric k-median clustering problem over a set of input rankings (i.e., permutations), which has myriad applications, from social-choice theory to web search and databases. A folklore algorithm provides a 2-approximate solution in polynomial time for all k = O(1), and works irrespective of the underlying distance measure, so long it is a metric; however, going below the 2-factor is a notorious challenge. We consider the Ulam distance, a variant of the well-known edit-distance metric, where strings are restricted to be permutations. For this metric, Chakraborty, Das, and Krauthgamer [SODA, 2021] provided a (2-δ)-approximation algorithm for k = 1, where δ≈ 2^{-40}. Our primary contribution is a new algorithmic framework for clustering a set of permutations. Our first result is a 1.999-approximation algorithm for the metric k-median problem under the Ulam metric, that runs in time (k log (nd))^{O(k)} nd³ for an input consisting of n permutations over [d]. In fact, our framework is powerful enough to extend this result to the streaming model (where the n input permutations arrive one by one) using only polylogarithmic (in n) space. Additionally, we show that similar results can be obtained even in the presence of outliers, which is presumably a more difficult problem.

 Certificate Games   
 Authors:  Sourav Chakraborty, Anna Gál, Sophie Laplante, Rajat Mittal, and Anupa Sunny  
  Abstract    
 We introduce and study Certificate Game complexity, a measure of complexity based on the probability of winning a game where two players are given inputs with different function values and are asked to output some index i such that x_i≠ y_i, in a zero-communication setting. We give upper and lower bounds for private coin, public coin, shared entanglement and non-signaling strategies, and give some separations. We show that complexity in the public coin model is upper bounded by Randomized query and Certificate complexity. On the other hand, it is lower bounded by fractional and randomized certificate complexity, making it a good candidate to prove strong lower bounds on randomized query complexity. Complexity in the private coin model is bounded from below by zero-error randomized query complexity. The quantum measure highlights an interesting and surprising difference between classical and quantum query models. Whereas the public coin certificate game complexity is bounded from above by randomized query complexity, the quantum certificate game complexity can be quadratically larger than quantum query complexity. We use non-signaling, a notion from quantum information, to give a lower bound of n on the quantum certificate game complexity of the OR function, whose quantum query complexity is Θ(√n), then go on to show that this "non-signaling bottleneck" applies to all functions with high sensitivity, block sensitivity or fractional block sensitivity. We also consider the single-bit version of certificate games, where the inputs of the two players are restricted to having Hamming distance 1. We prove that the single-bit version of certificate game complexity with shared randomness is equal to sensitivity up to constant factors, thus giving a new characterization of sensitivity. On the other hand, the single-bit version of certificate game complexity with private randomness is equal to λ², where λ is the spectral sensitivity.

 Lifting to Parity Decision Trees via Stifling   
 Authors:  Arkadev Chattopadhyay, Nikhil S. Mande, Swagato Sanyal, and Suhail Sherif  
  Abstract    
 We show that the deterministic decision tree complexity of a (partial) function or relation f lifts to the deterministic parity decision tree (PDT) size complexity of the composed function/relation f∘g as long as the gadget g satisfies a property that we call stifling. We observe that several simple gadgets of constant size, like Indexing on 3 input bits, Inner Product on 4 input bits, Majority on 3 input bits and random functions, satisfy this property. It can be shown that existing randomized communication lifting theorems ([Göös, Pitassi, Watson. SICOMP'20], [Chattopadhyay et al. SICOMP'21]) imply PDT-size lifting. However there are two shortcomings of this approach: first they lift randomized decision tree complexity of f, which could be exponentially smaller than its deterministic counterpart when either f is a partial function or even a total search problem. Second, the size of the gadgets in such lifting theorems are as large as logarithmic in the size of the input to f. Reducing the gadget size to a constant is an important open problem at the frontier of current research. Our result shows that even a random constant-size gadget does enable lifting to PDT size. Further, it also yields the first systematic way of turning lower bounds on the width of tree-like resolution proofs of the unsatisfiability of constant-width CNF formulas to lower bounds on the size of tree-like proofs in the resolution with parity system, i.e., Res(⊕), of the unsatisfiability of closely related constant-width CNF formulas.

 New Lower Bounds and Derandomization for ACC, and a Derandomization-Centric View on the Algorithmic Method   
 Authors:  Lijie Chen  
  Abstract    
 In this paper, we obtain several new results on lower bounds and derandomization for ACC⁰ circuits (constant-depth circuits consisting of AND/OR/MOD_m gates for a fixed constant m, a frontier class in circuit complexity): 1) We prove that any polynomial-time Merlin-Arthur proof system with an ACC⁰ verifier (denoted by MA_{ACC⁰}) can be simulated by a nondeterministic proof system with quasi-polynomial running time and polynomial proof length, on infinitely many input lengths. This improves the previous simulation by [Chen, Lyu, and Williams, FOCS 2020], which requires both quasi-polynomial running time and proof length. 2) We show that MA_{ACC⁰} cannot be computed by fixed-polynomial-size ACC⁰ circuits, and our hard languages are hard on a sufficiently dense set of input lengths. 3) We show that NEXP (nondeterministic exponential-time) does not have ACC⁰ circuits of sub-half-exponential size, improving the previous sub-third-exponential size lower bound for NEXP against ACC⁰ by [Williams, J. ACM 2014]. Combining our first and second results gives a conceptually simpler and derandomization-centric proof of the recent breakthrough result NQP := NTIME[2^polylog(n)] ̸ ⊂ ACC⁰ by [Murray and Williams, SICOMP 2020]: Instead of going through an easy witness lemma as they did, we first prove an ACC⁰ lower bound for a subclass of MA, and then derandomize that subclass into NQP, while retaining its hardness against ACC⁰. Moreover, since our derandomization of MA_{ACC⁰} achieves a polynomial proof length, we indeed prove that nondeterministic quasi-polynomial-time with n^ω(1) nondeterminism bits (denoted as NTIMEGUESS[2^polylog(n), n^ω(1)]) has no poly(n)-size ACC⁰ circuits, giving a new proof of a result by Vyas. Combining with a win-win argument based on randomized encodings from [Chen and Ren, STOC 2020], we also prove that NTIMEGUESS[2^polylog(n), n^ω(1)] cannot be 1/2+1/poly(n)-approximated by poly(n)-size ACC⁰ circuits, improving the recent strongly average-case lower bounds for NQP against ACC⁰ by [Chen and Ren, STOC 2020]. One interesting technical ingredient behind our second result is the construction of a PSPACE-complete language that is paddable, downward self-reducible, same-length checkable, and weakly error correctable. Moreover, all its reducibility properties have corresponding AC⁰[2] non-adaptive oracle circuits. Our construction builds and improves upon similar constructions from [Trevisan and Vadhan, Complexity 2007] and [Chen, FOCS 2019], which all require at least TC⁰ oracle circuits for implementing these properties.

 Black-Box Constructive Proofs Are Unavoidable   
 Authors:  Lijie Chen, Ryan Williams, and Tianqi Yang  
  Abstract    
 Following Razborov and Rudich, a "natural property" for proving a circuit lower bound satisfies three axioms: constructivity, largeness, and usefulness. In 2013, Williams proved that for any reasonable circuit class C, NEXP ⊂ C is equivalent to the existence of a constructive property useful against C. Here, a property is constructive if it can be decided in poly(N) time, where N = 2ⁿ is the length of the truth-table of the given n-input function. Recently, Fan, Li, and Yang initiated the study of black-box natural properties, which require a much stronger notion of constructivity, called black-box constructivity: the property should be decidable in randomized polylog(N) time, given oracle access to the n-input function. They showed that most proofs based on random restrictions yield black-box natural properties, and demonstrated limitations on what black-box natural properties can prove. In this paper, perhaps surprisingly, we prove that the equivalence of Williams holds even with this stronger notion of black-box constructivity: for any reasonable circuit class C, NEXP ⊂ C is equivalent to the existence of a black-box constructive property useful against C. The main technical ingredient in proving this equivalence is a smooth, strong, and locally-decodable probabilistically checkable proof (PCP), which we construct based on a recent work by Paradise. As a by-product, we show that average-case witness lower bounds for PCP verifiers follow from NEXP lower bounds. We also show that randomness is essential in the definition of black-box constructivity: we unconditionally prove that there is no deterministic polylog(N)-time constructive property that is useful against even polynomial-size AC⁰ circuits.

 Necessary Conditions in Multi-Server Differential Privacy   
 Authors:  Albert Cheu and Chao Yan  
  Abstract    
 We consider protocols where users communicate with multiple servers to perform a computation on the users' data. An adversary exerts semi-honest control over many of the parties but its view is differentially private with respect to honest users. Prior work described protocols that required multiple rounds of interaction or offered privacy against a computationally bounded adversary. Our work presents limitations of non-interactive protocols that offer privacy against unbounded adversaries. We prove that these protocols require exponentially more samples than centrally private counterparts to solve some learning, testing, and estimation tasks. This means sample-efficiency demands interactivity or computational differential privacy, or both.

 Quantum Algorithms and the Power of Forgetting   
 Authors:  Andrew M. Childs, Matthew Coudron, and Amin Shiraz Gilani  
  Abstract    
 The so-called welded tree problem provides an example of a black-box problem that can be solved exponentially faster by a quantum walk than by any classical algorithm [Andrew M. Childs et al., 2003]. Given the name of a special entrance vertex, a quantum walk can find another distinguished exit vertex using polynomially many queries, though without finding any particular path from entrance to exit. It has been an open problem for twenty years whether there is an efficient quantum algorithm for finding such a path, or if the path-finding problem is hard even for quantum computers. We show that a natural class of efficient quantum algorithms provably cannot find a path from entrance to exit. Specifically, we consider algorithms that, within each branch of their superposition, always store a set of vertex labels that form a connected subgraph including the entrance, and that only provide these vertex labels as inputs to the oracle. While this does not rule out the possibility of a quantum algorithm that efficiently finds a path, it is unclear how an algorithm could benefit by deviating from this behavior. Our no-go result suggests that, for some problems, quantum algorithms must necessarily forget the path they take to reach a solution in order to outperform classical computation.

 A New Conjecture on Hardness of 2-CSP’s with Implications to Hardness of Densest k-Subgraph and Other Problems   
 Authors:  Julia Chuzhoy, Mina Dalirrooyfard, Vadim Grinberg, and Zihan Tan  
  Abstract    
 We propose a new conjecture on hardness of 2-CSP’s, and show that new hardness of approximation results for Densest k-Subgraph and several other problems, including a graph partitioning problem, and a variation of the Graph Crossing Number problem, follow from this conjecture. The conjecture can be viewed as occupying a middle ground between the d-to-1 conjecture, and hardness results for 2-CSP’s that can be obtained via standard techniques, such as Parallel Repetition combined with standard 2-prover protocols for the 3SAT problem. We hope that this work will motivate further exploration of hardness of 2-CSP’s in the regimes arising from the conjecture. We believe that a positive resolution of the conjecture will provide a good starting point for other hardness of approximation proofs. Another contribution of our work is proving that the problems that we consider are roughly equivalent from the approximation perspective. Some of these problems arose in previous work, from which it appeared that they may be related to each other. We formalize this relationship in this work.

 Generalized Private Selection and Testing with High Confidence   
 Authors:  Edith Cohen, Xin Lyu, Jelani Nelson, Tamás Sarlós, and Uri Stemmer  
  Abstract    
 Composition theorems are general and powerful tools that facilitate privacy accounting across multiple data accesses from per-access privacy bounds. However they often result in weaker bounds compared with end-to-end analysis. Two popular tools that mitigate that are the exponential mechanism (or report noisy max) and the sparse vector technique, generalized in a recent private selection framework by Liu and Talwar (STOC 2019). In this work, we propose a flexible framework of private selection and testing that generalizes the one proposed by Liu and Talwar, supporting a wide range of applications. We apply our framework to solve several fundamental tasks, including query releasing, top-k selection, and stable selection, with improved confidence-accuracy tradeoffs. Additionally, for online settings, we apply our private testing to design a mechanism for adaptive query releasing, which improves the sample complexity dependence on the confidence parameter for the celebrated private multiplicative weights algorithm of Hardt and Rothblum (FOCS 2010).

 Exact Completeness of LP Hierarchies for Linear Codes   
 Authors:  Leonardo Nagami Coregliano, Fernando Granha Jeronimo, and Chris Jones  
  Abstract    
 Determining the maximum size A₂(n,d) of a binary code of blocklength n and distance d remains an elusive open question even when restricted to the important class of linear codes. Recently, two linear programming hierarchies extending Delsarte’s LP were independently proposed to upper bound A₂^{Lin}(n,d) (the analogue of A₂(n,d) for linear codes). One of these hierarchies, by the authors, was shown to be approximately complete in the sense that the hierarchy converges to A₂^{Lin}(n,d) as the level grows beyond n². Despite some structural similarities, not even approximate completeness was known for the other hierarchy by Loyfer and Linial. In this work, we prove that both hierarchies recover the exact value of A₂^{Lin}(n,d) at level n. We also prove that at this level the polytope of Loyfer and Linial is integral. Even though these hierarchies seem less powerful than general hierarchies such as Sum-of-Squares, we show that they have enough structure to yield exact completeness via pseudoprobabilities.

 HappyMap : A Generalized Multicalibration Method   
 Authors:  Zhun Deng, Cynthia Dwork, and Linjun Zhang  
  Abstract    
 Multicalibration is a powerful and evolving concept originating in the field of algorithmic fairness. For a predictor f that estimates the outcome y given covariates x, and for a function class C, multi-calibration requires that the predictor f(x) and outcome y are indistinguishable under the class of auditors in C. Fairness is captured by incorporating demographic subgroups into the class of functions C. Recent work has shown that, by enriching the class C to incorporate appropriate propensity re-weighting functions, multi-calibration also yields target-independent learning, wherein a model trained on a source domain performs well on unseen, future, target domains {(approximately) captured by the re-weightings.} Formally, multicalibration with respect to C bounds |𝔼_{(x,y)∼D}[c(f(x),x)⋅(f(x)-y)]| for all c ∈ C. In this work, we view the term (f(x)-y) as just one specific mapping, and explore the power of an enriched class of mappings. We propose s-Happy Multicalibration, a generalization of multi-calibration, which yields a wide range of new applications, including a new fairness notion for uncertainty quantification, a novel technique for conformal prediction under covariate shift, and a different approach to analyzing missing data, while also yielding a unified understanding of several existing seemingly disparate algorithmic fairness notions and target-independent learning approaches. We give a single HappyMap meta-algorithm that captures all these results, together with a sufficiency condition for its success.

 Bit Complexity of Jordan Normal Form and Polynomial Spectral Factorization   
 Authors:  Papri Dey, Ravi Kannan, Nick Ryder, and Nikhil Srivastava  
  Abstract    
 We study the bit complexity of two related fundamental computational problems in linear algebra and control theory. Our results are: (1) An Õ(n^{ω+3}a+n⁴a²+n^ωlog(1/ε)) time algorithm for finding an ε-approximation to the Jordan Normal form of an integer matrix with a-bit entries, where ω is the exponent of matrix multiplication. (2) An Õ(n⁶d⁶a+n⁴d⁴a²+n³d³log(1/ε)) time algorithm for ε-approximately computing the spectral factorization P(x) = Q^*(x)Q(x) of a given monic n× n rational matrix polynomial of degree 2d with rational a-bit coefficients having a-bit common denominators, which satisfies P(x)⪰0 for all real x. The first algorithm is used as a subroutine in the second one. Despite its being of central importance, polynomial complexity bounds were not previously known for spectral factorization, and for Jordan form the best previous best running time was an unspecified polynomial in n of degree at least twelve [Cai, 1994]. Our algorithms are simple and judiciously combine techniques from numerical and symbolic computation, yielding significant advantages over either approach by itself.

 Constant-Depth Sorting Networks   
 Authors:  Natalia Dobrokhotova-Maikova, Alexander Kozachinskiy, and Vladimir Podolskii  
  Abstract    
 In this paper, we address sorting networks that are constructed from comparators of arity k > 2. I.e., in our setting the arity of the comparators - or, in other words, the number of inputs that can be sorted at the unit cost - is a parameter. We study its relationship with two other parameters - n, the number of inputs, and d, the depth. This model received considerable attention. Partly, its motivation is to better understand the structure of sorting networks. In particular, sorting networks with large arity are related to recursive constructions of ordinary sorting networks. Additionally, studies of this model have natural correspondence with a recent line of work on constructing circuits for majority functions from majority gates of lower fan-in. Motivated by these questions, we initiate the studies of lower bounds for constant-depth sorting networks. More precisely, we consider sorting networks of constant depth d and estimate the minimal k for which there is such a network with comparators of arity k. We prove tight lower bounds for d ≤ 4. More precisely, for depths d = 1,2 we observe that k = n. For d = 3 we show that k = ⌈n/2⌉. As our main result, we show that for d = 4 the minimal arity becomes sublinear: k = Θ(n^{2/3}). This contrasts with the case of majority circuits, in which k = O(n^{2/3}) is achievable already for depth d = 3. To prove these results, we develop a new combinatorial technique based on the notion of access to cells of a sorting network.

 Rigidity in Mechanism Design and Its Applications   
 Authors:  Shahar Dobzinski and Ariel Shaulker  
  Abstract    
 We introduce the notion of rigidity in auction design and use it to analyze some fundamental aspects of mechanism design. We focus on the setting of a single-item auction where the values of the bidders are drawn from some (possibly correlated) distribution F. Let f be the allocation function of an optimal mechanism for F. Informally, S is (linearly) rigid in F if for every mechanism M' with an allocation function f' where f and f' agree on the allocation of at most x-fraction of the instances of S, it holds that the expected revenue of M' is at most an x fraction of the optimal revenue. We start with using rigidity to explain the singular success of Cremer and McLean’s auction assuming interim individual rationality. Recall that the revenue of Cremer and McLean’s auction is the optimal welfare if the distribution obeys a certain "full rank" conditions, but no analogous constructions are known if this condition does not hold. We show that the allocation function of the Cremer and McLean auction has logarithmic (in the size of the support) Kolmogorov complexity, whereas we use rigidity to show that there exist distributions that do not obey the full rank condition for which the allocation function of every mechanism that provides a constant approximation is almost linear. We further investigate rigidity assuming different notions of individual rationality. Assuming ex-post individual rationality, if there exists a rigid set then the structure of the optimal mechanism is relatively simple: the player with the highest value "usually" wins the item and contributes most of the revenue. In contrast, assuming interim individual rationality, there are distributions with a rigid set S where the optimal mechanism has no obvious allocation pattern (in the sense that its Kolmogorov complexity is high). Since the existence of rigid sets essentially implies that the hands of the designer are tied, our results help explain why we have little hope of developing good, simple and generic approximation mechanisms in the interim individual rationality world.

 Beeping Shortest Paths via Hypergraph Bipartite Decomposition   
 Authors:  Fabien Dufoulon, Yuval Emek, and Ran Gelles  
  Abstract    
 Constructing a shortest path between two network nodes is a fundamental task in distributed computing. This work develops schemes for the construction of shortest paths in randomized beeping networks between a predetermined source node and an arbitrary set of destination nodes. Our first scheme constructs a (single) shortest path to an arbitrary destination in O(D log log n + log³ n) rounds with high probability. Our second scheme constructs multiple shortest paths, one per each destination, in O(D log² n + log³ n) rounds with high probability. Our schemes are based on a reduction of the above shortest path construction tasks to a decomposition of hypergraphs into bipartite hypergraphs: We develop a beeping procedure that partitions the hyperedge set of a hypergraph H = (V_H, E_H) into k = Θ (log² n) disjoint subsets F₁ ∪ ⋯ ∪ F_k = E_H such that the (sub-)hypergraph (V_H, F_i) is bipartite in the sense that there exists a vertex subset U ⊆ V such that |U ∩ e| = 1 for every e ∈ F_i. This procedure turns out to be instrumental in speeding up shortest path constructions under the beeping model.

 Noisy Radio Network Lower Bounds via Noiseless Beeping Lower Bounds   
 Authors:  Klim Efremenko, Gillat Kol, Dmitry Paramonov, and Raghuvansh R. Saxena  
  Abstract    
 Much of today’s communication is carried out over large wireless systems with different input-output behaviors. In this work, we compare the power of central abstractions of wireless communication through the general notion of boolean symmetric f-channels: In every round of the f-channel, each of its n parties decides to either broadcast or not, and the channel outputs f(m), where m is the number of broadcasting parties. Our first result is that the well studied beeping channel, where f is the threshold-1 function, is not stronger than any other f-channel. To this end, we design a protocol over the f-channel and prove that any protocol that simulates it over the beeping channel blows up the round complexity by a factor of Ω(log n). Our lower bound technique may be of independent interest, as it essentially generalizes the popular fooling set technique by exploiting a "local" relaxation of combinatorial rectangles. Curiously, while this result shows the limitations of a noiseless channel, namely, the beeping channel, we are able to use it to show the limitations of the noisy version of many other channels. This includes the extensively studied single-hop radio network model with collisions-as-silence (CAS), which is equivalent to the f-channel with f(m) = 1 iff m = 1. In particular, our second and main result, obtained from the first, shows that converting CAS protocols to noise resilient ones may incur a large performance overhead, i.e., no constant rate interactive code exists. To this end, we design a CAS protocol and prove that any protocol that simulates it over the noisy CAS model with correlated stochastic noise, blows up the round complexity by a factor of Ω(log n). We mention that the Ω(log n) overhead in both our results is tight.

 Asymptotically Tight Bounds on the Time Complexity of Broadcast and Its Variants in Dynamic Networks   
 Authors:  Antoine El-Hayek, Monika Henzinger, and Stefan Schmid  
  Abstract    
 Data dissemination is a fundamental task in distributed computing. This paper studies broadcast problems in various innovative models where the communication network connecting n processes is dynamic (e.g., due to mobility or failures) and controlled by an adversary. In the first model, the processes transitively communicate their ids in synchronous rounds along a rooted tree given in each round by the adversary whose goal is to maximize the number of rounds until at least one id is known by all processes. Previous research has shown a ⌈(3n-1)/2⌉-2 lower bound and an O(nlog log n) upper bound. We show the first linear upper bound for this problem, namely ⌈(1+√2) n-1⌉ ≈ 2.4n. We extend these results to the setting where the adversary gives in each round k-disjoint forests and their goal is to maximize the number of rounds until there is a set of k ids such that each process knows of at least one of them. We give a ⌈3(n-k)/2⌉-1 lower bound and a (π²+6)/6 n+1 ≈ 2.6n upper bound for this problem. Finally, we study the setting where the adversary gives in each round a directed graph with k roots and their goal is to maximize the number of rounds until there exist k ids that are known by all processes. We give a ⌈3(n-3k)/2⌉+2 lower bound and a ⌈(1+√2)n⌉+k-1 ≈ 2.4n+k upper bound for this problem. For the two latter problems no upper or lower bounds were previously known.

 Differentially Private Continual Releases of Streaming Frequency Moment Estimations   
 Authors:  Alessandro Epasto, Jieming Mao, Andres Munoz Medina, Vahab Mirrokni, Sergei Vassilvitskii, and Peilin Zhong  
  Abstract    
 The streaming model of computation is a popular approach for working with large-scale data. In this setting, there is a stream of items and the goal is to compute the desired quantities (usually data statistics) while making a single pass through the stream and using as little space as possible. Motivated by the importance of data privacy, we develop differentially private streaming algorithms under the continual release setting, where the union of outputs of the algorithm at every timestamp must be differentially private. Specifically, we study the fundamental 𝓁_p (p ∈ [0,+∞)) frequency moment estimation problem under this setting, and give an ε-DP algorithm that achieves (1+η)-relative approximation (∀ η ∈ (0,1)) with polylog(Tn) additive error and uses polylog(Tn)⋅ max(1, n^{1-2/p}) space, where T is the length of the stream and n is the size of the universe of elements. Our space is near optimal up to poly-logarithmic factors even in the non-private setting. To obtain our results, we first reduce several primitives under the differentially private continual release model, such as counting distinct elements, heavy hitters and counting low frequency elements, to the simpler, counting/summing problems in the same setting. Based on these primitives, we develop a differentially private continual release level set estimation approach to address the 𝓁_p frequency moment estimation problem. We also provide a simple extension of our results to the harder sliding window model, where the statistics must be maintained over the past W data items.

 A Subpolynomial-Time Algorithm for the Free Energy of One-Dimensional Quantum Systems in the Thermodynamic Limit   
 Authors:  Hamza Fawzi, Omar Fawzi, and Samuel O. Scalet  
  Abstract    
 We introduce a classical algorithm to approximate the free energy of local, translation-invariant, one-dimensional quantum systems in the thermodynamic limit of infinite chain size. While the ground state problem (i.e., the free energy at temperature T = 0) for these systems is expected to be computationally hard even for quantum computers, our algorithm runs for any fixed temperature T > 0 in subpolynomial time, i.e., in time O((1/ε)^c) for any constant c > 0 where ε is the additive approximation error. Previously, the best known algorithm had a runtime that is polynomial in 1/ε where the degree of the polynomial is exponential in the inverse temperature 1/T. Our algorithm is also particularly simple as it reduces to the computation of the spectral radius of a linear map. This linear map has an interpretation as a noncommutative transfer matrix and has been studied previously to prove results on the analyticity of the free energy and the decay of correlations. We also show that the corresponding eigenvector of this map gives an approximation of the marginal of the Gibbs state and thereby allows for the computation of various thermodynamic properties of the quantum system.

 Expander Decomposition in Dynamic Streams   
 Authors:  Arnold Filtser, Michael Kapralov, and Mikhail Makarov  
  Abstract    
 In this paper we initiate the study of expander decompositions of a graph G = (V, E) in the streaming model of computation. The goal is to find a partitioning 𝒞 of vertices V such that the subgraphs of G induced by the clusters C ∈ 𝒞 are good expanders, while the number of intercluster edges is small. Expander decompositions are classically constructed by a recursively applying balanced sparse cuts to the input graph. In this paper we give the first implementation of such a recursive sparsest cut process using small space in the dynamic streaming model. Our main algorithmic tool is a new type of cut sparsifier that we refer to as a power cut sparsifier - it preserves cuts in any given vertex induced subgraph (or, any cluster in a fixed partition of V) to within a (δ, ε)-multiplicative/additive error with high probability. The power cut sparsifier uses Õ(n/εδ) space and edges, which we show is asymptotically tight up to polylogarithmic factors in n for constant δ.

 On Flipping the Fréchet Distance   
 Authors:  Omrit Filtser, Mayank Goswami, Joseph S. B. Mitchell, and Valentin Polishchuk  
  Abstract    
 The classical and extensively-studied Fréchet distance between two curves is defined as an inf max, where the infimum is over all traversals of the curves, and the maximum is over all concurrent positions of the two agents. In this article we investigate a "flipped" Fréchet measure defined by a sup min - the supremum is over all traversals of the curves, and the minimum is over all concurrent positions of the two agents. This measure produces a notion of "social distance" between two curves (or general domains), where agents traverse curves while trying to stay as far apart as possible. We first study the flipped Fréchet measure between two polygonal curves in one and two dimensions, providing conditional lower bounds and matching algorithms. We then consider this measure on polygons, where it denotes the minimum distance that two agents can maintain while restricted to travel in or on the boundary of the same polygon. We investigate several variants of the problem in this setting, for some of which we provide linear time algorithms. Finally, we consider this measure on graphs. We draw connections between our proposed flipped Fréchet measure and existing related work in computational geometry, hoping that our new measure may spawn investigations akin to those performed for the Fréchet distance, and into further interesting problems that arise.

 Budget Pacing in Repeated Auctions: Regret and Efficiency Without Convergence   
 Authors:  Jason Gaitonde, Yingkai Li, Bar Light, Brendan Lucier, and Aleksandrs Slivkins  
  Abstract    
 Online advertising via auctions increasingly dominates the marketing landscape. A typical advertiser may participate in thousands of auctions each day with bids tailored to a variety of signals about user demographics and intent. These auctions are strategically linked through a global budget constraint. To help address the difficulty of bidding, many major online platforms now provide automated budget management via a flexible approach called budget pacing: rather than bidding directly, an advertiser specifies a global budget target and a maximum willingness-to-pay for different types of advertising opportunities. The specified maximums are then scaled down (or "paced") by a multiplier so that the realized total spend matches the target budget. These automated bidders are now near-universally adopted across all mature advertising platforms, raising pressing questions about market outcomes that arise when advertisers use budget pacing simultaneously. In this paper we study the aggregate welfare and individual regret guarantees of dynamic pacing algorithms in repeated auctions with budgets. We show that when agents simultaneously use a natural form of gradient-based pacing, the liquid welfare obtained over the course of the dynamics is at least half the optimal liquid welfare obtainable by any allocation rule, matching the best possible bound for static auctions even in pure Nash equilibria [Aggarwal et al., WINE 2019; Babaioff et al., ITCS 2021]. In contrast to prior work, these results hold without requiring convergence of the dynamics, circumventing known computational obstacles of finding equilibria [Chen et al., EC 2021]. Our result is robust to the correlation structure among agents' valuations and holds for any core auction, a broad class that includes first-price, second-price, and GSP auctions. We complement the aggregate guarantees by showing that an agent using such pacing algorithms achieves an O(T^{3/4}) regret relative to the value obtained by the best fixed pacing multiplier in hindsight in stochastic bidding environments. Compared to past work, this result applies to more general auctions and extends to adversarial settings with respect to dynamic regret.

 Quantum Space, Ground Space Traversal, and How to Embed Multi-Prover Interactive Proofs into Unentanglement   
 Authors:  Sevag Gharibian and Dorian Rudolph  
  Abstract    
 A celebrated result in classical complexity theory is Savitch’s theorem, which states that non-deterministic polynomial-space computations (NPSPACE) can be simulated by deterministic poly-space computations (PSPACE). In this work, we initiate the study of a quantum analogue of NPSPACE, denoted Streaming-QCMASPACE (SQCMASPACE), in which an exponentially long classical proof is streamed to a poly-space quantum verifier. We first show that a quantum analogue of Savitch’s theorem is unlikely to hold, in that SQCMASPACE = NEXP. For completeness, we also introduce the companion class Streaming-QMASPACE (SQMASPACE) with an exponentially long streamed quantum proof, and show SQMASPACE = QMAEXP (the quantum analogue of NEXP). Our primary focus, however, is on the study of exponentially long streaming classical proofs, where we next show the following two main results. The first result shows that, in strong contrast to the classical setting, the solution space of a quantum constraint satisfaction problem (i.e. a local Hamiltonian) is always connected when exponentially long proofs are permitted. For this, we show how to simulate any Lipschitz continuous path on the unit hypersphere via a sequence of local unitary gates, at the expense of blowing up the circuit size. This shows that quantum error-correcting codes can be unable to detect one codeword erroneously evolving to another if the evolution happens sufficiently slowly, and answers an open question of [Gharibian, Sikora, ICALP 2015] regarding the Ground State Connectivity problem. Our second main result is that any SQCMASPACE computation can be embedded into "unentanglement", i.e. into a quantum constraint satisfaction problem with unentangled provers. Formally, we show how to embed SQCMASPACE into the Sparse Separable Hamiltonian problem of [Chailloux, Sattath, CCC 2012] (QMA(2)-complete for 1/poly promise gap), at the expense of scaling the promise gap with the streamed proof size. As a corollary, we obtain the first systematic construction for obtaining QMA(2)-type upper bounds on arbitrary multi-prover interactive proof systems, where the QMA(2) promise gap scales exponentially with the number of bits of communication in the interactive proof. Our construction uses a new technique for exploiting unentanglement to simulate quadratic Boolean functions, which in some sense allows history states to encode the future.

 Algorithms with More Granular Differential Privacy Guarantees   
 Authors:  Badih Ghazi, Ravi Kumar, Pasin Manurangsi, and Thomas Steinke  
  Abstract    
 Differential privacy is often applied with a privacy parameter that is larger than the theory suggests is ideal; various informal justifications for tolerating large privacy parameters have been proposed. In this work, we consider partial differential privacy (DP), which allows quantifying the privacy guarantee on a per-attribute basis. We study several basic data analysis and learning tasks in this framework, and design algorithms whose per-attribute privacy parameter is smaller that the best possible privacy parameter for the entire record of a person (i.e., all the attributes).

 Private Counting of Distinct and k-Occurring Items in Time Windows   
 Authors:  Badih Ghazi, Ravi Kumar, Jelani Nelson, and Pasin Manurangsi  
  Abstract    
 In this work, we study the task of estimating the numbers of distinct and k-occurring items in a time window under the constraint of differential privacy (DP). We consider several variants depending on whether the queries are on general time windows (between times t₁ and t₂), or are restricted to being cumulative (between times 1 and t₂), and depending on whether the DP neighboring relation is event-level or the more stringent item-level. We obtain nearly tight upper and lower bounds on the errors of DP algorithms for these problems. En route, we obtain an event-level DP algorithm for estimating, at each time step, the number of distinct items seen over the last W updates with error polylogarithmic in W; this answers an open question of Bolot et al. (ICDT 2013).

 Is Untrusted Randomness Helpful?   
 Authors:  Uma Girish, Ran Raz, and Wei Zhan  
  Abstract    
 Randomized algorithms and protocols assume the availability of a perfect source of randomness. In real life, however, perfect randomness is rare and is almost never guaranteed. The gap between these two facts motivated much of the work on randomness and derandomization in theoretical computer science. In this work, we define a new type of randomized algorithms (and protocols), that we call robustly-randomized algorithms (protocols). Such algorithms have access to two separate (read-once) random strings. The first string is trusted to be perfectly random, but its length is bounded by some parameter k = k(n) (where n is the length of the input). We think of k as relatively small, say sub-linear or poly-logarithmic in n. The second string is of unbounded length and is assumed to be random, but its randomness is not trusted. The output of the algorithm is either an output in the set of possible outputs of the problem, or a special symbol, interpreted as do not know and denoted by ⊥. On every input for the algorithm, the output of the algorithm must satisfy the following two requirements: 1) If the second random string is perfectly random then the algorithm must output the correct answer with high probability. 2) If the second random string is an arbitrary string, even adversarially chosen after seeing the input, the algorithm must output with high probability either the correct answer or the special symbol ⊥. We discuss relations of this new definition to several previously studied notions in randomness and derandomization. For example, when considering polynomial-time algorithms, if k is logarithmic we get the complexity class ZPP, while if k is unbounded we get the complexity class BPP, and for a general k, the algorithm can be viewed as an interactive proof with a probabilistic polynomial-time prover and a probabilistic polynomial-time verifier, where the prover is allowed an unlimited number of random bits and the verifier is limited to at most k random bits. Every previously-studied class of randomized algorithms or protocols, and more generally, every previous use of randomness in theoretical computer science, can be revisited and redefined in light of our new definition, by replacing each random string with a pair of random strings, the first is trusted to be perfectly random but is relatively short and the second is of unlimited length but its randomness is not trusted. The main question that we ask is: In which settings and for which problems is the untrusted random string helpful? Our main technical observation is that every problem in the class BPL (of problems solvable by bounded-error randomized logspace algorithms) can be solved by a robustly-randomized logspace algorithm with k = O(log n), that is with just a logarithmic number of trusted random bits. We also give query complexity separations that show cases where the untrusted random string is provenly helpful. Specifically, we show that there are promise problems that can be solved by robustly-randomized protocols with only one query and just a logarithmic number of trusted random bits, whereas any randomized protocol requires either a linear number of random bits or an exponential number of queries, and any zero-error randomized protocol requires a polynomial number of queries.

 Consensus Division in an Arbitrary Ratio   
 Authors:  Paul Goldberg and Jiawei Li  
  Abstract    
 We consider the problem of partitioning a line segment into two subsets, so that n finite measures all have the same ratio of values for the subsets. Letting α ∈ [0,1] denote the desired ratio, this generalises the PPA-complete consensus-halving problem, in which α = 1/2. Stromquist and Woodall [Stromquist and Woodall, 1985] showed that for any α, there exists a solution using 2n cuts of the segment. They also showed that if α is irrational, that upper bound is almost optimal. In this work, we elaborate the bounds for rational values α. For α = 𝓁/k, we show a lower bound of (k-1)/k ⋅ 2n - O(1) cuts; we also obtain almost matching upper bounds for a large subset of rational α. On the computational side, we explore its dependence on the number of cuts available. More specifically, 1) when using the minimal number of cuts for each instance is required, the problem is NP-hard for any α; 2) for a large subset of rational α = 𝓁/k, when (k-1)/k ⋅ 2n cuts are available, the problem is in PPA-k under Turing reduction; 3) when 2n cuts are allowed, the problem belongs to PPA for any α; more generally, the problem belong to PPA-p for any prime p if 2(p-1)⋅⌈p/2⌉/⌊p/2⌋ ⋅ n cuts are available.

 An Algorithmic Bridge Between Hamming and Levenshtein Distances   
 Authors:  Elazar Goldenberg, Tomasz Kociumaka, Robert Krauthgamer, and Barna Saha  
  Abstract    
 The edit distance between strings classically assigns unit cost to every character insertion, deletion, and substitution, whereas the Hamming distance only allows substitutions. In many real-life scenarios, insertions and deletions (abbreviated indels) appear frequently but significantly less so than substitutions. To model this, we consider substitutions being cheaper than indels, with cost 1/a for a parameter a ≥ 1. This basic variant, denoted ED_a, bridges classical edit distance (a = 1) with Hamming distance (a → ∞), leading to interesting algorithmic challenges: Does the time complexity of computing ED_a interpolate between that of Hamming distance (linear time) and edit distance (quadratic time)? What about approximating ED_a? We first present a simple deterministic exact algorithm for ED_a and further prove that it is near-optimal assuming the Orthogonal Vectors Conjecture. Our main result is a randomized algorithm computing a (1+ε)-approximation of ED_a(X,Y), given strings X,Y of total length n and a bound k ≥ ED_a(X,Y). For simplicity, let us focus on k ≥ 1 and a constant ε > 0; then, our algorithm takes Õ(n/a + ak³) time. Unless a = Õ(1), in which case ED_a resembles the standard edit distance, and for the most interesting regime of small enough k, this running time is sublinear in n. We also consider a very natural version that asks to find a (k_I, k_S)-alignment, i.e., an alignment with at most k_I indels and k_S substitutions. In this setting, we give an exact algorithm and, more importantly, an Õ((nk_I)/k_S + k_S k_I³)-time (1,1+ε)-bicriteria approximation algorithm. The latter solution is based on the techniques we develop for ED_a for a = Θ(k_S/k_I), and its running time is again sublinear in n whenever k_I ≪ k_S and the overall distance is small enough. These bounds are in stark contrast to unit-cost edit distance, where state-of-the-art algorithms are far from achieving (1+ε)-approximation in sublinear time, even for a favorable choice of k.

 On Interactive Proofs of Proximity with Proof-Oblivious Queries   
 Authors:  Oded Goldreich, Guy N. Rothblum, and Tal Skverer  
  Abstract    
 Interactive proofs of proximity (IPPs) offer ultra-fast approximate verification of assertions regarding their input, where ultra-fast means that only a small portion of the input is read and approximate verification is analogous to the notion of approximate decision that underlies property testing. Specifically, in an IPP, the prover can make the verifier accept each input in the property, but cannot fool the verifier into accepting an input that is far from the property (except for with small probability). The verifier in an IPP system engages in two very different types of activities: interacting with an untrusted prover, and querying its input. The definition allows for arbitrary coordination between these two activities, but keeping them separate is both conceptually interesting and necessary for important applications such as addressing temporal considerations (i.e., at what time is each of the services available) and facilitating the construction of zero-knowledge schemes. In this work we embark on a systematic study of IPPs with proof-oblivious queries, where the queries should not be affected by the interaction with the prover. We assign the query and interaction activities to separate modules, and consider different limitations on their coordination. The most strict limitation requires these activities to be totally isolated from one another; they just feed their views to a separate deciding module. We show that such systems can be efficiently emulated by standard testers. Going to the other extreme, we only disallow information to flow from the interacting module to the querying module, but allow free information flow in the other direction. We show that extremely efficient one-round (i.e., two-message) systems of such type can be used to verify properties that are extremely hard to test (without the help of a prover). That is, the complexity of verifying can be polylogarithmic in the complexity of testing. This stands in contrast the MAPs (viewed as 1/2-round systems) in which proof-oblivious queries are as limited as our isolated model. Our focus is on an intermediate model that allows shared randomness between the querying and interacting modules but no information flow between them. In this case we show that 1-round systems are efficiently emulated by standard testers but 3/2-round systems of extremely low complexity exist for properties that are extremely hard to test. One additional result about this model is that it can efficiently emulate any IPP for any property of low-degree polynomials.

  Abstract    
 We present a new perspective on loss minimization and the recent notion of Omniprediction through the lens of Outcome Indistingusihability. For a collection of losses and hypothesis class, omniprediction requires that a predictor provide a loss-minimization guarantee simultaneously for every loss in the collection compared to the best (loss-specific) hypothesis in the class. We present a generic template to learn predictors satisfying a guarantee we call Loss Outcome Indistinguishability. For a set of statistical tests - based on a collection of losses and hypothesis class - a predictor is Loss OI if it is indistinguishable (according to the tests) from Nature’s true probabilities over outcomes. By design, Loss OI implies omniprediction in a direct and intuitive manner. We simplify Loss OI further, decomposing it into a calibration condition plus multiaccuracy for a class of functions derived from the loss and hypothesis classes. By careful analysis of this class, we give efficient constructions of omnipredictors for interesting classes of loss functions, including non-convex losses. This decomposition highlights the utility of a new multi-group fairness notion that we call calibrated multiaccuracy, which lies in between multiaccuracy and multicalibration. We show that calibrated multiaccuracy implies Loss OI for the important set of convex losses arising from Generalized Linear Models, without requiring full multicalibration. For such losses, we show an equivalence between our computational notion of Loss OI and a geometric notion of indistinguishability, formulated as Pythagorean theorems in the associated Bregman divergence. We give an efficient algorithm for calibrated multiaccuracy with computational complexity comparable to that of multiaccuracy. In all, calibrated multiaccuracy offers an interesting tradeoff point between efficiency and generality in the omniprediction landscape.

 List Agreement Expansion from Coboundary Expansion   
 Authors:  Roy Gotlib and Tali Kaufman  
  Abstract    
 One of the key components in PCP constructions are agreement tests. In agreement test the tester is given access to subsets of fixed size of some set, each equipped with an assignment. The tester is then tasked with testing whether these local assignments agree with some global assignment over the entire set. One natural generalization of this concept is the case where, instead of a single assignment to each local view, the tester is given access to l different assignments for every subset. The tester is then tasked with testing whether there exist l global functions that agree with all of the assignments of all of the local views. In this work we present sufficient condition for a set system to exhibit this generalized definition of list agreement expansion. This is, to our knowledge, the first work to consider this natural generalization of agreement testing. Despite initially appearing very similar to agreement expansion in definition, proving that a set system exhibits list agreement expansion seem to require a different set of techniques. This is due to the fact that the natural extension of agreement testing (i.e. that there exists a pairing of the lists such that each pair agrees with each other) does not suffice when testing for list agreement as list agreement crucially relies on a global structure. It follows that if a local assignments satisfy list agreement they must not only agree locally but also exhibit some additional structure. In order to test for the existence of this additional structure we use the connection between covering spaces of a high dimensional complex and its coboundaries. Specifically, we use this connection as a form of "decoupling". Moreover, we show that any set system that exhibits list agreement expansion also supports direct sum testing. This is the first scheme for direct sum testing that works regardless of the parity of the sizes of the local sets. Prior to our work the schemes for direct sum testing were based on the parity of the sizes of the local tests.

 Asynchronous Multi-Party Quantum Computation   
 Authors:  Vipul Goyal, Chen-Da Liu-Zhang, Justin Raizes, and João Ribeiro  
  Abstract    
 Multi-party quantum computation (MPQC) allows a set of parties to securely compute a quantum circuit over private quantum data. Current MPQC protocols rely on the fact that the network is synchronous, i.e., messages sent are guaranteed to be delivered within a known fixed delay upper bound, and unfortunately completely break down even when only a single message arrives late. Motivated by real-world networks, the seminal work of Ben-Or, Canetti and Goldreich (STOC'93) initiated the study of multi-party computation for classical circuits over asynchronous networks, where the network delay can be arbitrary. In this work, we begin the study of asynchronous multi-party quantum computation (AMPQC) protocols, where the circuit to compute is quantum. Our results completely characterize the optimal achievable corruption threshold: we present an n-party AMPQC protocol secure up to t < n/4 corruptions, and an impossibility result when t ≥ n/4 parties are corrupted. Remarkably, this characterization differs from the analogous classical setting, where the optimal corruption threshold is t < n/3.

 Unsplittable Euclidean Capacitated Vehicle Routing: A (2+ε)-Approximation Algorithm   
 Authors:  Fabrizio Grandoni, Claire Mathieu, and Hang Zhou  
  Abstract    
 In the unsplittable capacitated vehicle routing problem, we are given a metric space with a vertex called depot and a set of vertices called terminals. Each terminal is associated with a positive demand between 0 and 1. The goal is to find a minimum length collection of tours starting and ending at the depot such that the demand of each terminal is covered by a single tour (i.e., the demand cannot be split), and the total demand of the terminals in each tour does not exceed the capacity of 1. Our main result is a polynomial-time (2+ε)-approximation algorithm for this problem in the two-dimensional Euclidean plane, i.e., for the special case where the terminals and the depot are associated with points in the Euclidean plane and their distances are defined accordingly. This improves on recent work by Blauth, Traub, and Vygen [IPCO'21] and Friggstad, Mousavi, Rahgoshay, and Salavatipour [IPCO'22].

 Low-Stabilizer-Complexity Quantum States Are Not Pseudorandom   
 Authors:  Sabee Grewal, Vishnu Iyer, William Kretschmer, and Daniel Liang  
  Abstract    
 We show that quantum states with "low stabilizer complexity" can be efficiently distinguished from Haar-random. Specifically, given an n-qubit pure state |ψ⟩, we give an efficient algorithm that distinguishes whether |ψ⟩ is (i) Haar-random or (ii) a state with stabilizer fidelity at least 1/k (i.e., has fidelity at least 1/k with some stabilizer state), promised that one of these is the case. With black-box access to |ψ⟩, our algorithm uses O(k^{12} log(1/δ)) copies of |ψ⟩ and O(n k^{12} log(1/δ)) time to succeed with probability at least 1-δ, and, with access to a state preparation unitary for |ψ⟩ (and its inverse), O(k³ log(1/δ)) queries and O(n k³ log(1/δ)) time suffice. As a corollary, we prove that ω(log(n)) T-gates are necessary for any Clifford+T circuit to prepare computationally pseudorandom quantum states, a first-of-its-kind lower bound.

 Look Before, Before You Leap: Online Vector Load Balancing with Few Reassignments   
 Authors:  Varun Gupta, Ravishankar Krishnaswamy, Sai Sandeep, and Janani Sundaresan  
  Abstract    
 In this paper we study two fully-dynamic multi-dimensional vector load balancing problems with recourse. The adversary presents a stream of n job insertions and deletions, where each job j is a vector in ℝ^d_{≥ 0}. In the vector scheduling problem, the algorithm must maintain an assignment of the active jobs to m identical machines to minimize the makespan (maximum load on any dimension on any machine). In the vector bin packing problem, the algorithm must maintain an assignment of active jobs into a number of bins of unit capacity in all dimensions, to minimize the number of bins currently used. In both problems, the goal is to maintain solutions that are competitive against the optimal solution for the active set of jobs, at every time instant. The algorithm is allowed to change the assignment from time to time, with the secondary objective of minimizing the amortized recourse, which is the average cardinality of the change of the assignment per update to the instance. For the vector scheduling problem, we present two simple algorithms. The first is a randomized algorithm with an O(1) amortized recourse and an O(log d/log log d) competitive ratio against oblivious adversaries. The second algorithm is a deterministic algorithm that is competitive against adaptive adversaries but with a slightly higher competitive ratio of O(log d) and a per-job recourse guarantee bounded by Õ(log n + log d log OPT). We also prove a sharper instance-dependent recourse guarantee for the deterministic algorithm. For the vector bin packing problem, we make the so-called small jobs assumption that the size of all jobs in all the coordinates is O(1/log d) and present a simple O(1)-competitive algorithm with O(log n) recourse against oblivious adversaries. For both problems, the main challenge is to determine when and how to migrate jobs to maintain competitive solutions. Our central idea is that for each job, we make these decisions based only on the active set of jobs that are "earlier" than this job in some ordering ≺ of the jobs.

 Incompressiblity and Next-Block Pseudoentropy   
 Authors:  Iftach Haitner, Noam Mazor, and Jad Silbak  
  Abstract    
 A distribution is k-incompressible, Yao [FOCS '82], if no efficient compression scheme compresses it to less than k bits. While being a natural measure, its relation to other computational analogs of entropy such as pseudoentropy, Hastad, Impagliazzo, Levin, and Luby [SICOMP '99], and to other cryptographic hardness assumptions, was unclear. We advance towards a better understating of this notion, showing that a k-incompressible distribution has (k-2) bits of next-block pseudoentropy, a refinement of pseudoentropy introduced by Haitner, Reingold, and Vadhan [SICOMP '13]. We deduce that a samplable distribution X that is (H(X)+2)-incompressible, implies the existence of one-way functions.

 Downward Self-Reducibility in TFNP   
 Authors:  Prahladh Harsha, Daniel Mitropolsky, and Alon Rosen  
  Abstract    
 A problem is downward self-reducible if it can be solved efficiently given an oracle that returns solutions for strictly smaller instances. In the decisional landscape, downward self-reducibility is well studied and it is known that all downward self-reducible problems are in PSPACE. In this paper, we initiate the study of downward self-reducible search problems which are guaranteed to have a solution - that is, the downward self-reducible problems in TFNP. We show that most natural PLS-complete problems are downward self-reducible and any downward self-reducible problem in TFNP is contained in PLS. Furthermore, if the downward self-reducible problem is in TFUP (i.e. it has a unique solution), then it is actually contained in UEOPL, a subclass of CLS. This implies that if integer factoring is downward self-reducible then it is in fact in UEOPL, suggesting that no efficient factoring algorithm exists using the factorization of smaller numbers.

 Symmetric Formulas for Products of Permutations   
 Authors:  William He and Benjamin Rossman  
  Abstract    
 We study the formula complexity of the word problem Word_{S_n,k} : {0,1}^{kn²} → {0,1}: given n-by-n permutation matrices M₁,… ,M_k, compute the (1,1)-entry of the matrix product M₁⋯ M_k. An important feature of this function is that it is invariant under action of S_n^{k-1} given by (π₁,… ,π_{k-1})(M₁,… ,M_k) = (M₁π₁^{-1},π₁M₂π₂^{-1},… ,π_{k-2}M_{k-1}π_{k-1}^{-1},π_{k-1}M_k). This symmetry is also exhibited in the smallest known unbounded fan-in {and,or,not}-formulas for Word_{S_n,k}, which have size n^O(log k). In this paper we prove a matching n^{Ω(log k)} lower bound for S_n^{k-1}-invariant formulas computing Word_{S_n,k}. This result is motivated by the fact that a similar lower bound for unrestricted (non-invariant) formulas would separate complexity classes NC¹ and Logspace. Our more general main theorem gives a nearly tight n^d(k^{1/d}-1) lower bound on the G^{k-1}-invariant depth-d {maj,and,or,not}-formula size of Word_{G,k} for any finite simple group G whose minimum permutation representation has degree n. We also give nearly tight lower bounds on the G^{k-1}-invariant depth-d {and,or,not}-formula size in the case where G is an abelian group.

 A Combinatorial Cut-Toggling Algorithm for Solving Laplacian Linear Systems   
 Authors:  Monika Henzinger, Billy Jin, Richard Peng, and David P. Williamson  
  Abstract    
 Over the last two decades, a significant line of work in theoretical algorithms has made progress in solving linear systems of the form 𝐋𝐱 = 𝐛, where 𝐋 is the Laplacian matrix of a weighted graph with weights w(i,j) > 0 on the edges. The solution 𝐱 of the linear system can be interpreted as the potentials of an electrical flow in which the resistance on edge (i,j) is 1/w(i,j). Kelner, Orrechia, Sidford, and Zhu [Kelner et al., 2013] give a combinatorial, near-linear time algorithm that maintains the Kirchoff Current Law, and gradually enforces the Kirchoff Potential Law by updating flows around cycles (cycle toggling). In this paper, we consider a dual version of the algorithm that maintains the Kirchoff Potential Law, and gradually enforces the Kirchoff Current Law by cut toggling: each iteration updates all potentials on one side of a fundamental cut of a spanning tree by the same amount. We prove that this dual algorithm also runs in a near-linear number of iterations. We show, however, that if we abstract cut toggling as a natural data structure problem, this problem can be reduced to the online vector-matrix-vector problem (OMv), which has been conjectured to be difficult for dynamic algorithms [Henzinger et al., 2015]. The conjecture implies that the data structure does not have an O(n^{1-ε}) time algorithm for any ε > 0, and thus a straightforward implementation of the cut-toggling algorithm requires essentially linear time per iteration. To circumvent the lower bound, we batch update steps, and perform them simultaneously instead of sequentially. An appropriate choice of batching leads to an Õ(m^{1.5}) time cut-toggling algorithm for solving Laplacian systems. Furthermore, we show that if we sparsify the graph and call our algorithm recursively on the Laplacian system implied by batching and sparsifying, we can reduce the running time to O(m^{1 + ε}) for any ε > 0. Thus, the dual cut-toggling algorithm can achieve (almost) the same running time as its primal cycle-toggling counterpart.

 Learning Versus Pseudorandom Generators in Constant Parallel Time   
 Authors:  Shuichi Hirahara and Mikito Nanashima  
  Abstract    
 A polynomial-stretch pseudorandom generator (PPRG) in NC⁰ (i.e., constant parallel time) is one of the most important cryptographic primitives, especially for constructing highly efficient cryptography and indistinguishability obfuscation. The celebrated work (Applebaum, Ishai, and Kushilevitz, SIAM Journal on Computing, 2006) on randomized encodings yields the characterization of sublinear-stretch pseudorandom generators in NC⁰ by the existence of logspace-computable one-way functions, but characterizing PPRGs in NC⁰ seems out of reach at present. Therefore, it is natural to ask which sort of hardness notion is essential for constructing PPRGs in NC⁰. Particularly, to the best of our knowledge, all the previously known candidates for PPRGs in NC⁰ follow only one framework based on Goldreich’s one-way function. In this paper, we present a new learning-theoretic characterization for PPRGs in NC⁰ and related classes. Specifically, we consider the average-case hardness of learning for well-studied classes in parameterized settings, where the number of samples is restricted to fixed-parameter tractable (FPT), and show that the following are equivalent: - The existence of (a collection of) PPRGs in NC⁰. - The average-case hardness of learning sparse 𝔽₂-polynomials on a sparse example distribution and an NC⁰-samplable target distribution (i.e., a distribution on target functions). - The average-case hardness of learning Fourier-sparse functions on a sparse example distribution and an NC⁰-samplable target distribution. - The average-case hardness of learning constant-depth parity decision trees on a sparse example distribution and an NC⁰-samplable target distribution. Furthermore, we characterize a (single) PPRG in parity-NC⁰ by the average-case hardness of learning constant-degree 𝔽₂-polynomials on a uniform example distribution with FPT samples. Based on our results, we propose new candidates for PPRGs in NC⁰ and related classes under a hardness assumption on a natural learning problem. An important property of PPRGs in NC⁰ constructed in our framework is that the output bits are computed by various predicates; thus, it seems to resist an attack that depends on a specific property of one fixed predicate. Conceptually, the main contribution of this study is to formalize a theory of FPT dualization of concept classes, which yields a meta-theorem for the first result. For the second result on PPRGs in parity-NC⁰, we use a different technique of pseudorandom 𝔽₂-polynomials.

 Secure Distributed Network Optimization Against Eavesdroppers   
 Authors:  Yael Hitron, Merav Parter, and Eylon Yogev  
  Abstract    
 We present a new algorithmic framework for distributed network optimization in the presence of eavesdropper adversaries, also known as passive wiretappers. In this setting, the adversary is listening to the traffic exchanged over a fixed set of edges in the graph, trying to extract information on the private input and output of the vertices. A distributed algorithm is denoted as f-secure, if it guarantees that the adversary learns nothing on the input and output for the vertices, provided that it controls at most f graph edges. Recent work has presented general simulation results for f-secure algorithms, with a round overhead of D^Θ(f), where D is the diameter of the graph. In this paper, we present a completely different white-box, and yet quite general, approach for obtaining f-secure algorithms for fundamental network optimization tasks. Specifically, for n-vertex D-diameter graphs with (unweighted) edge-connectivity Ω(f), there are f-secure congest algorithms for computing MST, partwise aggregation, and (1+ε) (weighted) minimum cut approximation, within Õ(D+f √n) congest rounds, hence nearly tight for f = Õ(1). Our algorithms are based on designing a secure algorithmic-toolkit that leverages the special structure of congest algorithms for global optimization graph problems. One of these tools is a general secure compiler that simulates light-weight distributed algorithms in a congestion-sensitive manner. We believe that these tools set the ground for designing additional secure solutions in the congest model and beyond.

 Comparative Learning: A Sample Complexity Theory for Two Hypothesis Classes   
 Authors:  Lunjia Hu and Charlotte Peale  
  Abstract    
 In many learning theory problems, a central role is played by a hypothesis class: we might assume that the data is labeled according to a hypothesis in the class (usually referred to as the realizable setting), or we might evaluate the learned model by comparing it with the best hypothesis in the class (the agnostic setting). Taking a step beyond these classic setups that involve only a single hypothesis class, we study a variety of problems that involve two hypothesis classes simultaneously. We introduce comparative learning as a combination of the realizable and agnostic settings in PAC learning: given two binary hypothesis classes S and B, we assume that the data is labeled according to a hypothesis in the source class S and require the learned model to achieve an accuracy comparable to the best hypothesis in the benchmark class B. Even when both S and B have infinite VC dimensions, comparative learning can still have a small sample complexity. We show that the sample complexity of comparative learning is characterized by the mutual VC dimension VC(S,B) which we define to be the maximum size of a subset shattered by both S and B. We also show a similar result in the online setting, where we give a regret characterization in terms of the analogous mutual Littlestone dimension Ldim(S,B). These results also hold for partial hypotheses. We additionally show that the insights necessary to characterize the sample complexity of comparative learning can be applied to other tasks involving two hypothesis classes. In particular, we characterize the sample complexity of realizable multiaccuracy and multicalibration using the mutual fat-shattering dimension, an analogue of the mutual VC dimension for real-valued hypotheses. This not only solves an open problem proposed by Hu, Peale, Reingold (2022), but also leads to independently interesting results extending classic ones about regression, boosting, and covering number to our two-hypothesis-class setting.

 Recovery from Non-Decomposable Distance Oracles   
 Authors:  Zhuangfei Hu, Xinda Li, David P. Woodruff, Hongyang Zhang, and Shufan Zhang  
  Abstract    
 A line of work has looked at the problem of recovering an input from distance queries. In this setting, there is an unknown sequence s ∈ {0,1}^{≤ n}, and one chooses a set of queries y ∈ {0,1}^𝒪(n) and receives d(s,y) for a distance function d. The goal is to make as few queries as possible to recover s. Although this problem is well-studied for decomposable distances, i.e., distances of the form d(s,y) = ∑_{i=1}^n f(s_i, y_i) for some function f, which includes the important cases of Hamming distance, 𝓁_p-norms, and M-estimators, to the best of our knowledge this problem has not been studied for non-decomposable distances, for which there are important special cases such as edit distance, dynamic time warping (DTW), Fréchet distance, earth mover’s distance, and so on. We initiate the study and develop a general framework for such distances. Interestingly, for some distances such as DTW or Fréchet, exact recovery of the sequence s is provably impossible, and so we show by allowing the characters in y to be drawn from a slightly larger alphabet this then becomes possible. In a number of cases we obtain optimal or near-optimal query complexity. We also study the role of adaptivity for a number of different distance functions. One motivation for understanding non-adaptivity is that the query sequence can be fixed and the distances of the input to the queries provide a non-linear embedding of the input, which can be used in downstream applications involving, e.g., neural networks for natural language processing.

 Karchmer-Wigderson Games for Hazard-Free Computation   
 Authors:  Christian Ikenmeyer, Balagopal Komarath, and Nitin Saurabh  
  Abstract    
 We present a Karchmer-Wigderson game to study the complexity of hazard-free formulas. This new game is both a generalization of the monotone Karchmer-Wigderson game and an analog of the classical Boolean Karchmer-Wigderson game. Therefore, it acts as a bridge between the existing monotone and general games. Using this game, we prove hazard-free formula size and depth lower bounds that are provably stronger than those possible by the standard technique of transferring results from monotone complexity in a black-box fashion. For the multiplexer function we give (1) a hazard-free formula of optimal size and (2) an improved low-depth hazard-free formula of almost optimal size and (3) a hazard-free formula with alternation depth 2 that has optimal depth. We then use our optimal constructions to obtain an improved universal worst-case hazard-free formula size upper bound. We see our results as a step towards establishing hazard-free computation as an independent missing link between Boolean complexity and monotone complexity.

 Learning Reserve Prices in Second-Price Auctions   
 Authors:  Yaonan Jin, Pinyan Lu, and Tao Xiao  
  Abstract    
 This paper proves the tight sample complexity of Second-Price Auction with Anonymous Reserve, up to a logarithmic factor, for each of all the value distribution families studied in the literature: [0,1]-bounded, [1,H]-bounded, regular, and monotone hazard rate (MHR). Remarkably, the setting-specific tight sample complexity poly(ε^{-1}) depends on the precision ε ∈ (0, 1), but not on the number of bidders n ≥ 1. Further, in the two bounded-support settings, our learning algorithm allows correlated value distributions. In contrast, the tight sample complexity Θ̃(n) ⋅ poly(ε^{-1}) of Myerson Auction proved by Guo, Huang and Zhang (STOC 2019) has a nearly-linear dependence on n ≥ 1, and holds only for independent value distributions in every setting. We follow a similar framework as the Guo-Huang-Zhang work, but replace their information theoretical arguments with a direct proof.

 The Complexity of Infinite-Horizon General-Sum Stochastic Games   
 Authors:  Yujia Jin, Vidya Muthukumar, and Aaron Sidford  
  Abstract    
 We study the complexity of computing stationary Nash equilibrium (NE) in n-player infinite-horizon general-sum stochastic games. We focus on the problem of computing NE in such stochastic games when each player is restricted to choosing a stationary policy and rewards are discounted. First, we prove that computing such NE is in PPAD (in addition to clearly being PPAD-hard). Second, we consider turn-based specializations of such games where at each state there is at most a single player that can take actions and show that these (seemingly-simpler) games remain PPAD-hard. Third, we show that under further structural assumptions on the rewards computing NE in such turn-based games is possible in polynomial time. Towards achieving these results we establish structural facts about stochastic games of broader utility, including monotonicity of utilities under single-state single-action changes and reductions to settings where each player controls a single state.

 Random Max-CSPs Inherit Algorithmic Hardness from Spin Glasses   
 Authors:  Chris Jones, Kunal Marwaha, Juspreet Singh Sandhu, and Jonathan Shi  
  Abstract    
 We study random constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) at large clause density. We relate the structure of near-optimal solutions for any Boolean Max-CSP to that for an associated spin glass on the hypercube, using the Guerra-Toninelli interpolation from statistical physics. The noise stability polynomial of the CSP’s predicate is, up to a constant, the mixture polynomial of the associated spin glass. We show two main consequences: 1) We prove that the maximum fraction of constraints that can be satisfied in a random Max-CSP at large clause density is determined by the ground state energy density of the corresponding spin glass. Since the latter value can be computed with the Parisi formula [Parisi, 1980; Talagrand, 2006; Auffinger and Chen, 2017], we provide numerical values for some popular CSPs. 2) We prove that a Max-CSP at large clause density possesses generalized versions of the overlap gap property if and only if the same holds for the corresponding spin glass. We transfer results from [Huang and Sellke, 2021] to obstruct algorithms with overlap concentration on a large class of Max-CSPs. This immediately includes local classical and local quantum algorithms [Chou et al., 2022].

 Garland’s Technique for Posets and High Dimensional Grassmannian Expanders   
 Authors:  Tali Kaufman and Ran J. Tessler  
  Abstract    
 Local to global machinery plays an important role in the study of simplicial complexes, since the seminal work of Garland [Garland, 1973] to our days. In this work we develop a local to global machinery for general posets. We show that the high dimensional expansion notions and many recent expansion results have a generalization to posets. Examples are fast convergence of high dimensional random walks generalizing [Kaufman et al., 2020], [Alev and Lau, 2020], an equivalence with a global random walk definition, generalizing [Dikstein et al., 2018] and a trickling down theorem, generalizing [Oppenheim, 2018]. In particular, we show that some posets, such as the Grassmannian poset, exhibit qualitatively stronger trickling down effect than simplicial complexes. Using these methods, and the novel idea of posetification to Ramanujan complexes [Lubotzky et al., 2005a], [Lubotzky et al., 2005b], we construct a constant degree expanding Grassmannian poset, and analyze its expansion. This it the first construction of such object, whose existence was conjectured in [Dikstein et al., 2018].

 Making Decisions Under Outcome Performativity   
 Authors:  Michael P. Kim and Juan C. Perdomo  
  Abstract    
 Decision-makers often act in response to data-driven predictions, with the goal of achieving favorable outcomes. In such settings, predictions don’t passively forecast the future; instead, predictions actively shape the distribution of outcomes they are meant to predict. This performative prediction setting [Brown et al., 2022] raises new challenges for learning "optimal" decision rules. In particular, existing solution concepts do not address the apparent tension between the goals of forecasting outcomes accurately and steering individuals to achieve desirable outcomes. To contend with this concern, we introduce a new optimality concept - performative omniprediction - adapted from the supervised (non-performative) learning setting [Gopalan et al., 2022]. A performative omnipredictor is a single predictor that simultaneously encodes the optimal decision rule with respect to many possibly-competing objectives. Our main result demonstrates that efficient performative omnipredictors exist, under a natural restriction of performative prediction, which we call outcome performativity. On a technical level, our results follow by carefully generalizing the notion of outcome indistinguishability [Cynthia Dwork et al., 2021] to the outcome performative setting. From an appropriate notion of Performative OI, we recover many consequences known to hold in the supervised setting, such as omniprediction and universal adaptability [Kim et al., 2022].

 Characterizing the Multi-Pass Streaming Complexity for Solving Boolean CSPs Exactly   
 Authors:  Gillat Kol, Dmitry Paramonov, Raghuvansh R. Saxena, and Huacheng Yu  
  Abstract    
 We study boolean constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) Max-CSP^f_n for all predicates f: {0,1}^k → {0,1}. In these problems, given an integer v and a list of constraints over n boolean variables, each obtained by applying f to a sequence of literals, we wish to decide if there is an assignment to the variables that satisfies at least v constraints. We consider these problems in the streaming model, where the algorithm makes a small number of passes over the list of constraints. Our first and main result is the following complete characterization: For every predicate f, the streaming space complexity of the Max-CSP^f_n problem is Θ̃(n^deg(f)), where deg(f) is the degree of f when viewed as a multilinear polynomial. While the upper bound is obtained by a (very simple) one-pass streaming algorithm, our lower bound shows that a better space complexity is impossible even with constant-pass streaming algorithms. Building on our techniques, we are also able to get an optimal Ω(n²) lower bound on the space complexity of constant-pass streaming algorithms for the well studied Max-CUT problem, even though it is not technically a Max-CSP^f_n problem as, e.g., negations of variables and repeated constraints are not allowed.

 False Consensus, Information Theory, and Prediction Markets   
 Authors:  Yuqing Kong and Grant Schoenebeck  
  Abstract    
 We study a setting where Bayesian agents with a common prior have private information related to an event’s outcome and sequentially make public announcements relating to their information. Our main result shows that when agents' private information is independent conditioning on the event’s outcome whenever agents have similar beliefs about the outcome, their information is aggregated. That is, there is no false consensus. Our main result has a short proof based on a natural information-theoretic framework. A key ingredient of the framework is the equivalence between the sign of the "interaction information" and a super/sub-additive property of the value of people’s information. This provides an intuitive interpretation and an interesting application of the interaction information, which measures the amount of information shared by three random variables. We illustrate the power of this information-theoretic framework by reproving two additional results within it: 1) that agents quickly agree when announcing (summaries of) beliefs in round-robin fashion [Aaronson 2005], and 2) results from [Chen et al 2010] on when prediction market agents should release information to maximize their payment. We also interpret the information-theoretic framework and the above results in prediction markets by proving that the expected reward of revealing information is the conditional mutual information of the information revealed.

 Depth-Bounded Quantum Cryptography with Applications to One-Time Memory and More   
 Authors:  Qipeng Liu  
  Abstract    
 With the power of quantum information, we can achieve exciting and classically impossible cryptographic primitives. However, almost all quantum cryptography faces extreme difficulties with the near-term intermediate-scale quantum technology (NISQ technology); namely, the short lifespan of quantum states and limited sequential computation. At the same time, considering only limited quantum adversaries may still enable us to achieve never-before-possible tasks. In this work, we consider quantum cryptographic primitives against limited quantum adversaries - depth-bounded adversaries. We introduce a model for (depth-bounded) NISQ computers, which are classical circuits interleaved with shallow quantum circuits. Then, we show one-time memory can be achieved against any depth-bounded quantum adversaries introduced in the work, with their depth being any pre-fixed polynomial. Therefore we obtain applications like one-time programs and one-time proofs. Finally, we show our one-time memory has correctness even against constant-rate errors.

 Vertex Sparsification for Edge Connectivity in Polynomial Time   
 Authors:  Yang P. Liu  
  Abstract    
 An important open question in the area of vertex sparsification is whether (1+ε)-approximate cut-preserving vertex sparsifiers with size close to the number of terminals exist. The work [Parinya Chalermsook et al., 2021] (SODA 2021) introduced a relaxation called connectivity-c mimicking networks, which asks to construct a vertex sparsifier which preserves connectivity among k terminals exactly up to the value of c, and showed applications to dynamic connectivity data structures and survivable network design. We show that connectivity-c mimicking networks with Õ(kc³) edges exist and can be constructed in polynomial time in n and c, improving over the results of [Parinya Chalermsook et al., 2021] for any c ≥ log n, whose runtimes depended exponentially on c.

 Fractional Certificates for Bounded Functions   
 Authors:  Shachar Lovett and Jiapeng Zhang  
  Abstract    
 A folklore conjecture in quantum computing is that the acceptance probability of a quantum query algorithm can be approximated by a classical decision tree, with only a polynomial increase in the number of queries. Motivated by this conjecture, Aaronson and Ambainis (Theory of Computing, 2014) conjectured that this should hold more generally for any bounded function computed by a low degree polynomial. In this work we prove two new results towards establishing this conjecture: first, that any such polynomial has a small fractional certificate complexity; and second, that many inputs have a small sensitive block. We show that these would imply the Aaronson and Ambainis conjecture, assuming a conjectured extension of Talagrand’s concentration inequality. On the technical side, many classical techniques used in the analysis of Boolean functions seem to fail when applied to bounded functions. Here, we develop a new technique, based on a mix of combinatorics, analysis and geometry, and which in part extends a recent technique of Knop et al. (STOC 2021) to bounded functions.

 Improved Inapproximability of VC Dimension and Littlestone’s Dimension via (Unbalanced) Biclique   
 Authors:  Pasin Manurangsi  
  Abstract    
 We study the complexity of computing (and approximating) VC Dimension and Littlestone’s Dimension when we are given the concept class explicitly. We give a simple reduction from Maximum (Unbalanced) Biclique problem to approximating VC Dimension and Littlestone’s Dimension. With this connection, we derive a range of hardness of approximation results and running time lower bounds. For example, under the (randomized) Gap-Exponential Time Hypothesis or the Strongish Planted Clique Hypothesis, we show a tight inapproximability result: both dimensions are hard to approximate to within a factor of o(log n) in polynomial-time. These improve upon constant-factor inapproximability results from [Pasin Manurangsi and Aviad Rubinstein, 2017].

 Resilience of 3-Majority Dynamics to Non-Uniform Schedulers   
 Authors:  Uri Meir, Rotem Oshman, Ofer Shayevitz, and Yuval Volkov  
  Abstract    
 In recent years there has been great interest in networks of passive, computationally-weak nodes, whose interactions are controlled by the outside environment; examples include population protocols, chemical reactions networks (CRNs), DNA computing, and more. Such networks are usually studied under one of two extreme regimes: the schedule of interactions is either assumed to be adversarial, or it is assumed to be chosen uniformly at random. In this paper we study an intermediate regime, where the interaction at each step is chosen from some not-necessarily-uniform distribution: we introduce the definition of a (p,ε)-scheduler, where the distribution that the scheduler chooses at every round can be arbitrary, but it must have 𝓁_p-distance at most ε from the uniform distribution. We ask how far from uniform we can get before the dynamics of the model break down. For simplicity, we focus on the 3-majority dynamics, a type of chemical reaction network where the nodes of the network interact in triplets. Each node initially has an opinion of either 𝖷 or 𝖸, and when a triplet of nodes interact, all three nodes change their opinion to the majority of their three opinions. It is known that under a uniformly random scheduler, if we have an initial gap of Ω(√{n log n}) in favor of one value, then w.h.p. all nodes converge to the majority value within O(n log n) steps. For the 3-majority dynamics, we prove that among all non-uniform schedulers with a given 𝓁_1- or 𝓁_∞-distance to the uniform scheduler, the worst case is a scheduler that creates a partition in the network, disconnecting some nodes from the rest: under any (p,ε)-close scheduler, if the scheduler’s distance from uniform only suffices to disconnect a set of size at most S nodes and we start from a configuration with a gap of Ω(S+√{n log n}) in favor of one value, then we are guaranteed that all but O(S) nodes will convert to the majority value. We also show that creating a partition is not necessary to cause the system to converge to the wrong value, or to fail to converge at all. We believe that our work can serve as a first step towards understanding the resilience of chemical reaction networks and population protocols under non-uniform schedulers.

 Proofs of Quantumness from Trapdoor Permutations   
 Authors:  Tomoyuki Morimae and Takashi Yamakawa  
  Abstract    
 Assume that Alice can do only classical probabilistic polynomial-time computing while Bob can do quantum polynomial-time computing. Alice and Bob communicate over only classical channels, and finally Bob gets a state |x₀⟩+|x₁⟩ with some bit strings x₀ and x₁. Is it possible that Alice can know {x₀,x₁} but Bob cannot? Such a task, called remote state preparations, is indeed possible under some complexity assumptions, and is bases of many quantum cryptographic primitives such as proofs of quantumness, (classical-client) blind quantum computing, (classical) verifications of quantum computing, and quantum money. A typical technique to realize remote state preparations is to use 2-to-1 trapdoor collision resistant hash functions: Alice sends a 2-to-1 trapdoor collision resistant hash function f to Bob, and Bob evaluates it coherently, i.e., Bob generates ∑_x|x⟩|f(x)⟩. Bob measures the second register to get the measurement result y, and sends y to Alice. Bob’s post-measurement state is |x₀⟩+|x₁⟩, where f(x₀) = f(x₁) = y. With the trapdoor, Alice can learn {x₀,x₁} from y, but due to the collision resistance, Bob cannot. This Alice’s advantage can be leveraged to realize the quantum cryptographic primitives listed above. It seems that the collision resistance is essential here. In this paper, surprisingly, we show that the collision resistance is not necessary for a restricted case: we show that (non-verifiable) remote state preparations of |x₀⟩+|x₁⟩ secure against classical probabilistic polynomial-time Bob can be constructed from classically-secure (full-domain) trapdoor permutations. Trapdoor permutations are not likely to imply the collision resistance, because black-box reductions from collision-resistant hash functions to trapdoor permutations are known to be impossible. As an application of our result, we construct proofs of quantumness from classically-secure (full-domain) trapdoor permutations.

 Extremal Combinatorics, Iterated Pigeonhole Arguments and Generalizations of PPP   
 Authors:  Amol Pasarkar, Christos Papadimitriou, and Mihalis Yannakakis  
  Abstract    
 We study the complexity of computational problems arising from existence theorems in extremal combinatorics. For some of these problems, a solution is guaranteed to exist based on an iterated application of the Pigeonhole Principle. This results in the definition of a new complexity class within TFNP, which we call PLC (for "polynomial long choice"). PLC includes all of PPP, as well as numerous previously unclassified total problems, including search problems related to Ramsey’s theorem, the Sunflower theorem, the Erdős-Ko-Rado lemma, and König’s lemma. Whether the first two of these four problems are PLC-complete is an important open question which we pursue; in contrast, we show that the latter two are PPP-complete. Finally, we reframe PPP as an optimization problem, and define a hierarchy of such problems related to Turàn’s theorem.

 The Strength of Equality Oracles in Communication   
 Authors:  Toniann Pitassi, Morgan Shirley, and Adi Shraibman  
  Abstract    
 It is well-known that randomized communication protocols are more powerful than deterministic protocols. In particular the Equality function requires Ω(n) deterministic communication complexity but has efficient randomized protocols. Previous work of Chattopadhyay, Lovett and Vinyals shows that randomized communication is strictly stronger than what can be solved by deterministic protocols equipped with an Equality oracle. Despite this separation, we are far from understanding the exact strength of Equality oracles in the context of communication complexity. In this work we focus on nondeterminisic communication equipped with an Equality oracle, which is a subclass of Merlin-Arthur communication. We show that this inclusion is strict by proving that the previously-studied Integer Inner Product function, which can be efficiently computed even with bounded-error randomness, cannot be computed using sublinear communication in the nondeterministic Equality model. To prove this we give a new matrix-theoretic characterization of the nondeterministic Equality model: specifically, there is a tight connection between this model and a covering number based on the blocky matrices of Hambardzumyan, Hatami, and Hatami, as well as a natural variant of the Gamma-2 factorization norm. Similar equivalences are shown for the unambiguous nondeterministic model with Equality oracles. A bonus result arises from these proofs: for the studied communication models, a single Equality oracle call suffices without loss of generality. Our results allow us to prove a separation between deterministic and unambiguous nondeterminism in the presence of Equality oracles. This stands in contrast to the result of Yannakakis which shows that these models are polynomially-related without oracles. We suggest a number of intriguing open questions along this direction of inquiry, as well as others that arise from our work.

 Quantum Proofs of Deletion for Learning with Errors   
 Authors:  Alexander Poremba  
  Abstract    
 Quantum information has the property that measurement is an inherently destructive process. This feature is most apparent in the principle of complementarity, which states that mutually incompatible observables cannot be measured at the same time. Recent work by Broadbent and Islam (TCC 2020) builds on this aspect of quantum mechanics to realize a cryptographic notion called certified deletion. While this remarkable notion enables a classical verifier to be convinced that a (private-key) quantum ciphertext has been deleted by an untrusted party, it offers no additional layer of functionality. In this work, we augment the proof-of-deletion paradigm with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). We construct the first fully homomorphic encryption scheme with certified deletion - an interactive protocol which enables an untrusted quantum server to compute on encrypted data and, if requested, to simultaneously prove data deletion to a client. Our scheme has the desirable property that verification of a deletion certificate is public; meaning anyone can verify that deletion has taken place. Our main technical ingredient is an interactive protocol by which a quantum prover can convince a classical verifier that a sample from the Learning with Errors (LWE) distribution in the form of a quantum state was deleted. As an application of our protocol, we construct a Dual-Regev public-key encryption scheme with certified deletion, which we then extend towards a (leveled) FHE scheme of the same type. We introduce the notion of Gaussian-collapsing hash functions - a special case of collapsing hash functions defined by Unruh (Eurocrypt 2016) - and we prove the security of our schemes under the assumption that the Ajtai hash function satisfies a certain strong Gaussian-collapsing property in the presence of leakage.

 Online Pen Testing   
 Authors:  Mingda Qiao and Gregory Valiant  
  Abstract    
 We study a "pen testing" problem, in which we are given n pens with unknown amounts of ink X₁, X₂, …, X_n, and we want to choose a pen with the maximum amount of remaining ink in it. The challenge is that we cannot access each X_i directly; we only get to write with the i-th pen until either a certain amount of ink is used, or the pen runs out of ink. In both cases, this testing reduces the remaining ink in the pen and thus the utility of selecting it. Despite this significant lack of information, we show that it is possible to approximately maximize our utility up to an O(log n) factor. Formally, we consider two different setups: the "prophet" setting, in which each X_i is independently drawn from some distribution 𝒟_i, and the "secretary" setting, in which (X_i)_{i=1}^n is a random permutation of arbitrary a₁, a₂, …, a_n. We derive the optimal competitive ratios in both settings up to constant factors. Our algorithms are surprisingly robust: (1) In the prophet setting, we only require one sample from each 𝒟_i, rather than a full description of the distribution; (2) In the secretary setting, the algorithm also succeeds under an arbitrary permutation, if an estimate of the maximum a_i is given. Our techniques include a non-trivial online sampling scheme from a sequence with an unknown length, as well as the construction of a hard, non-uniform distribution over permutations. Both might be of independent interest. We also highlight some immediate open problems and discuss several directions for future research.

 Decision-Making Under Miscalibration   
 Authors:  Guy N. Rothblum and Gal Yona  
  Abstract    
 How should we use ML-based predictions (e.g., risk of heart attack) to inform downstream binary classification decisions (e.g., undergoing a medical procedure)? When the risk estimates are perfectly calibrated, the answer is well understood: a classification problem’s cost structure induces an optimal treatment threshold j^⋆. In practice, however, predictors are often miscalibrated, and this can lead to harmful decisions. This raises a fundamental question: how should one use potentially miscalibrated predictions to inform binary decisions? In this work, we study this question from the perspective of algorithmic fairness. Specifically, we focus on the impact of decisions on protected demographic subgroups, when we are only given a bound on the predictor’s anticipated degree of subgroup-miscalibration. We formalize a natural (distribution-free) solution concept for translating predictions into decisions: given anticipated miscalibration of α, we propose using the threshold j that minimizes the worst-case regret over all α-miscalibrated predictors, where the regret is the difference in clinical utility between using the threshold in question and using the optimal threshold in hindsight. We provide closed form expressions for j when miscalibration is measured using both expected and maximum calibration error which reveal that it indeed differs from j^⋆ (the optimal threshold under perfect calibration).

 Beyond Worst-Case Budget-Feasible Mechanism Design   
 Authors:  Aviad Rubinstein and Junyao Zhao  
  Abstract    
 Motivated by large-market applications such as crowdsourcing, we revisit the problem of budget-feasible mechanism design under a "small-bidder assumption". Anari, Goel, and Nikzad (2018) gave a mechanism that has optimal competitive ratio 1-1/e on worst-case instances. However, we observe that on many realistic instances, their mechanism is significantly outperformed by a simpler open clock auction by Ensthaler and Giebe (2014), although the open clock auction only achieves competitive ratio 1/2 in the worst case. Is there a mechanism that gets the best of both worlds, i.e., a mechanism that is worst-case optimal and performs favorably on realistic instances? To answer this question, we initiate the study of beyond worst-case budget-feasible mechanism design. Our first main result is the design and the analysis of a natural mechanism that gives an affirmative answer to our question above: - We prove that on every instance, our mechanism performs at least as good as all uniform mechanisms, including Anari, Goel, and Nikzad’s and Ensthaler and Giebe’s mechanisms. - Moreover, we empirically evaluate our mechanism on various realistic instances and observe that it beats the worst-case 1-1/e competitive ratio by a large margin and compares favorably to both mechanisms mentioned above. Our second main result is more interesting in theory: We show that in the semi-adversarial model of budget-smoothed analysis, where the adversary designs a single worst-case market for a distribution of budgets, our mechanism is optimal among all (including non-uniform) mechanisms; furthermore our mechanism guarantees a strictly better-than-(1-1/e) expected competitive ratio for any non-trivial budget distribution regardless of the market. (In contrast, given any bounded range of budgets, we can construct a single market where Anari, Goel, and Nikzad’s mechanism achieves only 1-1/e competitive ratio for every budget in this range.) We complement the positive result with a characterization of the worst-case markets for any given budget distribution and prove a fairly robust hardness result that holds against any budget distribution and any mechanism.

 Is It Easier to Count Communities Than Find Them?   
 Authors:  Cynthia Rush, Fiona Skerman, Alexander S. Wein, and Dana Yang  
  Abstract    
 Random graph models with community structure have been studied extensively in the literature. For both the problems of detecting and recovering community structure, an interesting landscape of statistical and computational phase transitions has emerged. A natural unanswered question is: might it be possible to infer properties of the community structure (for instance, the number and sizes of communities) even in situations where actually finding those communities is believed to be computationally hard? We show the answer is no. In particular, we consider certain hypothesis testing problems between models with different community structures, and we show (in the low-degree polynomial framework) that testing between two options is as hard as finding the communities. In addition, our methods give the first computational lower bounds for testing between two different "planted" distributions, whereas previous results have considered testing between a planted distribution and an i.i.d. "null" distribution.

 An Improved Lower Bound for Matroid Intersection Prophet Inequalities   
 Authors:  Raghuvansh R. Saxena, Santhoshini Velusamy, and S. Matthew Weinberg  
  Abstract    
 We consider prophet inequalities subject to feasibility constraints that are the intersection of q matroids. The best-known algorithms achieve a Θ(q)-approximation, even when restricted to instances that are the intersection of q partition matroids, and with i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables [José R. Correa et al., 2022; Moran Feldman et al., 2016; Marek Adamczyk and Michal Wlodarczyk, 2018]. The previous best-known lower bound is Θ(√q) due to a simple construction of [Robert Kleinberg and S. Matthew Weinberg, 2012] (which uses i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables, and writes the construction as the intersection of partition matroids). We establish an improved lower bound of q^{1/2+Ω(1/log log q)} by writing the construction of [Robert Kleinberg and S. Matthew Weinberg, 2012] as the intersection of asymptotically fewer partition matroids. We accomplish this via an improved upper bound on the product dimension of a graph with p^p disjoint cliques of size p, using recent techniques developed in [Noga Alon and Ryan Alweiss, 2020].

 Unitary Property Testing Lower Bounds by Polynomials   
 Authors:  Adrian She and Henry Yuen  
  Abstract    
 We study unitary property testing, where a quantum algorithm is given query access to a black-box unitary and has to decide whether it satisfies some property. In addition to containing the standard quantum query complexity model (where the unitary encodes a binary string) as a special case, this model contains "inherently quantum" problems that have no classical analogue. Characterizing the query complexity of these problems requires new algorithmic techniques and lower bound methods. Our main contribution is a generalized polynomial method for unitary property testing problems. By leveraging connections with invariant theory, we apply this method to obtain lower bounds on problems such as determining recurrence times of unitaries, approximating the dimension of a marked subspace, and approximating the entanglement entropy of a marked state. We also present a unitary property testing-based approach towards an oracle separation between QMA and QMA(2), a long standing question in quantum complexity theory.

 What Can Cryptography Do for Decentralized Mechanism Design?   
 Authors:  Elaine Shi, Hao Chung, and Ke Wu  
  Abstract    
 Recent works of Roughgarden (EC'21) and Chung and Shi (SODA'23) initiate the study of a new decentralized mechanism design problem called transaction fee mechanism design (TFM). Unlike the classical mechanism design literature, in the decentralized environment, even the auctioneer (i.e., the miner) can be a strategic player, and it can even collude with a subset of the users facilitated by binding side contracts. Chung and Shi showed two main impossibility results that rule out the existence of a dream TFM. First, any TFM that provides incentive compatibility for individual users and miner-user coalitions must always have zero miner revenue, no matter whether the block size is finite or infinite. Second, assuming finite block size, no non-trivial TFM can simultaneously provide incentive compatibility for any individual user and for any miner-user coalition. In this work, we explore what new models and meaningful relaxations can allow us to circumvent the impossibility results of Chung and Shi. Besides today’s model that does not employ cryptography, we introduce a new MPC-assisted model where the TFM is implemented by a joint multi-party computation (MPC) protocol among the miners. We prove several feasibility and infeasibility results for achieving strict and approximate incentive compatibility, respectively, in the plain model as well as the MPC-assisted model. We show that while cryptography is not a panacea, it indeed allows us to overcome some impossibility results pertaining to the plain model, leading to non-trivial mechanisms with useful guarantees that are otherwise impossible in the plain model. Our work is also the first to characterize the mathematical landscape of transaction fee mechanism design under approximate incentive compatibility, as well as in a cryptography-assisted model.

 Efficient Algorithms for Certifying Lower Bounds on the Discrepancy of Random Matrices   
 Authors:  Prayaag Venkat  
  Abstract    
 In this paper, we initiate the study of the algorithmic problem of certifying lower bounds on the discrepancy of random matrices: given an input matrix A ∈ ℝ^{m × n}, output a value that is a lower bound on disc(A) = min_{x ∈ {± 1}ⁿ} ‖Ax‖_∞ for every A, but is close to the typical value of disc(A) with high probability over the choice of a random A. This problem is important because of its connections to conjecturally-hard average-case problems such as negatively-spiked PCA [Afonso S. Bandeira et al., 2020], the number-balancing problem [Gamarnik and Kızıldağ, 2021] and refuting random constraint satisfaction problems [Prasad Raghavendra et al., 2017]. We give the first polynomial-time algorithms with non-trivial guarantees for two main settings. First, when the entries of A are i.i.d. standard Gaussians, it is known that disc(A) = Θ (√n2^{-n/m}) with high probability [Karthekeyan Chandrasekaran and Santosh S. Vempala, 2014; Aubin et al., 2019; Paxton Turner et al., 2020] and that super-constant levels of the Sum-of-Squares SDP hierarchy fail to certify anything better than disc(A) ≥ 0 when m < n - o(n) [Mrinalkanti Ghosh et al., 2020]. In contrast, our algorithm certifies that disc(A) ≥ exp(-O(n²/m)) with high probability. As an application, this formally refutes a conjecture of Bandeira, Kunisky, and Wein [Afonso S. Bandeira et al., 2020] on the computational hardness of the detection problem in the negatively-spiked Wishart model. Second, we consider the integer partitioning problem: given n uniformly random b-bit integers a₁, …, a_n, certify the non-existence of a perfect partition, i.e. certify that disc(A) ≥ 1 for A = (a₁, …, a_n). Under the scaling b = α n, it is known that the probability of the existence of a perfect partition undergoes a phase transition from 1 to 0 at α = 1 [Christian Borgs et al., 2001]; our algorithm certifies the non-existence of perfect partitions for some α = O(n). We also give efficient non-deterministic algorithms with significantly improved guarantees, raising the possibility that the landscape of these certification problems closely resembles that of e.g. the problem of refuting random 3SAT formulas in the unsatisfiable regime. Our algorithms involve a reduction to the Shortest Vector Problem and employ the Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovász algorithm.

 On Oracles and Algorithmic Methods for Proving Lower Bounds   
 Authors:  Nikhil Vyas and Ryan Williams  
  Abstract    
 This paper studies the interaction of oracles with algorithmic approaches to proving circuit complexity lower bounds, establishing new results on two different kinds of questions. 1) We revisit some prominent open questions in circuit lower bounds, and provide a clean way of viewing them as circuit upper bound questions. Let Missing-String be the (total) search problem of producing a string that does not appear in a given list L containing M bit-strings of length N, where M < 2ⁿ. We show in a generic way how algorithms and uniform circuits (from restricted classes) for Missing-String imply complexity lower bounds (and in some cases, the converse holds as well). We give a local algorithm for Missing-String, which can compute any desired output bit making very few probes into the input, when the number of strings M is small enough. We apply this to prove a new nearly-optimal (up to oracles) time hierarchy theorem with advice. We show that the problem of constructing restricted uniform circuits for Missing-String is essentially equivalent to constructing functions without small non-uniform circuits, in a relativizing way. For example, we prove that small uniform depth-3 circuits for Missing-String would imply exponential circuit lower bounds for Σ₂ EXP, and depth-3 lower bounds for Missing-String would imply non-trivial circuits (relative to an oracle) for Σ₂ EXP problems. Both conclusions are longstanding open problems in circuit complexity. 2) It has been known since Impagliazzo, Kabanets, and Wigderson [JCSS 2002] that generic derandomizations improving subexponentially over exhaustive search would imply lower bounds such as NEXP ̸ ⊂ 𝖯/poly. Williams [SICOMP 2013] showed that Circuit-SAT algorithms running barely faster than exhaustive search would imply similar lower bounds. The known proofs of such results do not relativize (they use techniques from interactive proofs/PCPs). However, it has remained open whether there is an oracle under which the generic implications from circuit-analysis algorithms to circuit lower bounds fail. Building on an oracle of Fortnow, we construct an oracle relative to which the circuit approximation probability problem (CAPP) is in 𝖯, yet EXP^{NP} has polynomial-size circuits. We construct an oracle relative to which SAT can be solved in "half-exponential" time, yet exponential time (EXP) has polynomial-size circuits. Improving EXP to NEXP would give an oracle relative to which Σ₂ 𝖤 has "half-exponential" size circuits, which is open. (Recall it is known that Σ₂ 𝖤 is not in "sub-half-exponential" size, and the proof relativizes.) Moreover, the running time of the SAT algorithm cannot be improved: relative to all oracles, if SAT is in "sub-half-exponential" time then EXP does not have polynomial-size circuits.

 The Time Complexity of Consensus Under Oblivious Message Adversaries   
 Authors:  Kyrill Winkler, Ami Paz, Hugo Rincon Galeana, Stefan Schmid, and Ulrich Schmid  
  Abstract    
 We study the problem of solving consensus in synchronous directed dynamic networks, in which communication is controlled by an oblivious message adversary that picks the communication graph to be used in a round from a fixed set of graphs 𝐃 arbitrarily. In this fundamental model, determining consensus solvability and designing efficient consensus algorithms is surprisingly difficult. Enabled by a decision procedure that is derived from a well-established previous consensus solvability characterization for a given set 𝐃, we study, for the first time, the time complexity of solving consensus in this model: We provide both upper and lower bounds for this time complexity, and also relate it to the number of iterations required by the decision procedure. Among other results, we find that reaching consensus under an oblivious message adversary can take exponentially longer than both deciding consensus solvability and broadcasting the input value of some unknown process to all other processes.

 Exponential Separations Using Guarded Extension Variables   
 Authors:  Emre Yolcu and Marijn J. H. Heule  
  Abstract    
 We study the complexity of proof systems augmenting resolution with inference rules that allow, given a formula Γ in conjunctive normal form, deriving clauses that are not necessarily logically implied by Γ but whose addition to Γ preserves satisfiability. When the derived clauses are allowed to introduce variables not occurring in Γ, the systems we consider become equivalent to extended resolution. We are concerned with the versions of these systems without new variables. They are called BC⁻, RAT⁻, SBC⁻, and GER⁻, denoting respectively blocked clauses, resolution asymmetric tautologies, set-blocked clauses, and generalized extended resolution. Each of these systems formalizes some restricted version of the ability to make assumptions that hold "without loss of generality," which is commonly used informally to simplify or shorten proofs. Except for SBC⁻, these systems are known to be exponentially weaker than extended resolution. They are, however, all equivalent to it under a relaxed notion of simulation that allows the translation of the formula along with the proof when moving between proof systems. By taking advantage of this fact, we construct formulas that separate RAT⁻ from GER⁻ and vice versa. With the same strategy, we also separate SBC⁻ from RAT⁻. Additionally, we give polynomial-size SBC⁻ proofs of the pigeonhole principle, which separates SBC⁻ from GER⁻ by a previously known lower bound. These results also separate the three systems from BC⁻ since they all simulate it. We thus give an almost complete picture of their relative strengths.

     Informing science is a transdiscipline that was established to promote the study of informing processes across a diverse set of academic disciplines, including management information systems, education, business, instructional technology, computer science, communications, psychology, philosophy, library science, information science and many others. Its principal unit of analysis is the informing system, a collection of informers, clients, and channels that has been designed or has evolved to serve a particular informing need. The organization created to advance the informing science transdiscipline is the Informing Science Institute (ISI), whose founder, Eli Cohen, proposed the need for the field in his article "Reconceptualizing Information Systems as a Field of the Transdiscipline Informing Science: From Ugly Duckling to Swan" (Cohen, 1999). The ISI presently hosts an annual conference (Informing Science & Information Technology Education (InSITE)), publishes thirteen academic journals, and—through its Informing Science Press—has published dozens of books. Both its journals and books are open access at no cost online, as well as being available for purchase in print form.

 1. History   
 Informing science came into being as a transdiscipline around 1998. During that year, two key events occurred. The seminal article that defined the field (Cohen, 1999) was accepted for publication and the field's flagship journal-- Informing Science: The International Journal of an Emerging Transdiscipline  —was launched.  
 The theme of Cohen's (1999) article was relatively simple, and resonated with many in the global academic community. In brief, he argued that many different disciplines are studying the same types of issues: teaching programming, communicating effectively, designing systems to provide information to clients, and so forth, as illustrated in Table 1. This situation was not only inefficient from a research standpoint, but it also tended to promote research silos in which researchers from one discipline were unable to benefit from the research of colleagues in other disciplines. In the long run, he asserted that such a situation would be highly deleterious to our overall understanding of these processes. He expressed particular concern with the situation in his own research discipline, management information systems  , which was already becoming fragmented and increasingly irrelevant to practice.

 Information Systems | Workers in a Firm, Managers

 Public Relations | Public 
 Secretarial/Office Systems | Office Workers 
  
 What Cohen proposed as an antidote to this situation was the establishment of an interdisciplinary community of researchers described as follows:  
 The fields that comprise the discipline of Informing Science provide  their clientele  with information  in a form  , format  and schedule  that maximizes its effectiveness (Cohen, 1999, p. 215)   During its earliest years, the informing science discipline was particularly focused on issues related to management information systems and information/library science—the fields from which many of its researchers originated. Over time, however, instructional technology became an important area of research, leading to the establishment of additional journals in the informing science in the education and instructional technology areas. In recent years, an effort has been made to further broaden the field. In 2009, the collection Foundations of Informing Science  (Gill & Cohen, 2009) was published, including both seminal articles from its journals and new contributions. The collection included chapters related to economics, decision theory, political science, education, design, complexity science, and mining. Currently, the informing science field is encouraging interest in research that is not necessarily related to technology. In a keynote address given at InSITE 2011 by T. Grandon Gill, the editor-in-chief of the journal Informing Science, proposed that the field could be described as follows:  
 Informing Science  is the transdisciplinary study of systems that employ information to impact clientele   In that same address, a number of areas meriting additional research were proposed. These included:  
 Greater emphasis on informing systems that evolve, as opposed to those that are created by design 
  Study of informing through non-symbolic means, such as body language and music, as well as through language and the exchange of coded data 
  Paying greater attention to the topologies of informing systems as opposed to emphasizing Sender → Receiver communications models whose roots go back to Claude Shannon (Shannon & Weaver, 1949) 
  Obstacles to informing, such as bias and heuristics, that are particularly challenging when human clients are involved 
  The relationship of informing systems structure and the complexity of the message being conveyed 
  2. Informing Systems   
 The basic unit of analysis for informing science is the informing system. According to the original Cohen (1999) article, such systems consist of three components: an informing environment  , a delivery system  and a task completion system  , as shown in Figure 1:  
    
 Figure 1:  Informing Science Framework (Gill & Cohen, 1999, p. 14). By Grandon.Gill - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=16232225   

 The delivery system  represented the combination of technological and non-technological elements that comprised the communications channel. The informing environment  represented the system components of the system on the informer's (sender's) side. The task completion system  involved the components of the system related to the client (user, receiver) of the information. This particular conception, illustrated in Figure 2, allowed the model map well to Shannon's communication model.

 2.1. Topology of Informing Systems   
 While the basic model did, and still does, serve as a useful unit of analysis, it was pointed out that "real world" informing systems come in many topologies, as illustrated in Figure 3.

 Among the variations of systems listed are the following (Gill & Bhattacherjee, 2007, p. 19):  
 Sender and client components are rarely homogeneous. Rather, senders consist of complex informing environments that involve subsystems that may, themselves, be informing systems. The same can be said of clients... 
  Senders may be members of multiple informing systems that inform different clients. Drucker (1989), for example, refers to the inherent tension that knowledge workers experience as they divide their loyalties between profession (e.g., accounting, law, medicine) and the organization that employs them. 
  Multiple senders may compete to inform the same client. For example different departments(disciplines) may compete for the same set of students; doctors from different specialties may compete to diagnose the same patients, etc. 
  Multiple communications pathways may be utilized within the same informing system. For example, an advertising campaign may involve the use of print, broadcast and web-based media in order to reach its entire client base. 
  Multiple clients may be informed by the same sender, and may have to compete for that sender's attention. For example, a patient may find his or her case is neglected as a consequence of the attention a doctor pays to the needs of other patients. 
  Clients may, themselves, serve as part of an extended informing system. For example, a company may depend heavily on "word of mouth" advertising to gain new clients. 
  2.2. Construction of Informing Systems   
 Given the field's origins in management information systems (MIS) research, it is not unexpected that early investigations into, and conceptualizations of, the development of informing systems tended to rely heavily on technology-based experienced. Cohen (1999), for example, viewed informing systems as having three levels:  
 The | informing instance | level, where actual informing activities took place. 
  The | construction | level, at which new informing instances were created according to the prevailing design templates. 
  The | design | level, at which new architectures for informing were realized. 
  As examples, he proposed (Cohen, 1999, p. 217):  
 (1) teaching a course someone else has designed, (2) designing a course that will be taught by others, and (3) creating a new curriculum. A business example is (1) using an existing transaction processing system (TPS), (2) creating a TPS following general design rules, and (3) creating a new type of TPS.      
 Figure 4:  Parallel informing systems with multiple levels having overlapping clients (Gill & Bhattacherjes, 2007, p. 23). By Grandon.Gill - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=16264061   

 As illustrated in Figure 4, Gill and Bhattacherjee (2007) further expanded the concept with the example of academic informing systems, which can be described in terms of two related informing systems that share many of the same clients. The disciplinary system  represents the research field with which faculty members and departments are aligned. The institutional system  represents the activities of the college or university, primarily focused on informing student clients. In subsequent publications (e.g., Gill, 2009a), informing science researchers have also begun to address the issue of how such systems can evolve, as opposed to being a pure product of design. The importance of understanding these informal processes for informing system development—even for IT-based systems—has been underscored by the rapid acceptance of technologies such as social media. There is little question that users have adapted these technologies for their own informing purposes in ways far beyond those anticipated by the original designers of the systems.  
 3. Informing Science Research   
 In informing science, the term transdiscipline  refers to the idea that a common problem—in this case the challenges presented by informing  --may benefit from the diversity of insights and perspectives offered by multiple disciplines, sometimes referred to as the component disciplines  or client disciplines  of informing science. To foster such a collaboration among researchers, however, requires extending the notion of what constitutes "research". It has also led to the development of a number of parallel research streams.  
 3.1. Extending the Definition of Research   
 In an open letter to the informing science community describing the types of research appropriate for the field, the Editor-in-Chief of Informing Science: The International Journal of an Emerging Transdiscipline  T. Grandon Gill made the following statement (Gill, 2009b, p. vi):  
 The transdisciplinary character of InformSciJ requires that we be willing to publish a broad array of contributions. In many of our client fields, most published research contributions can be characterized as either theory-building or theory-testing. While submissions of this type are, of course, encouraged, we will also consider a broader range of contributions, including: Synthesis | : An existing body of theory and observations are organized into a more cohesive whole. A literature review may fall into this category, but only if it attempts to propose a novel systematic organization for the existing literature. 
  Illustration | : The meaning or implications of a particular theory are explained and clarified through an illustrative example. In the business literature, for example, nearly all practitioner-directed publications use this technique extensively. 
  Unexplained Observation | : A rich observation, often having properties not well explained with existing theory, that is offered without serious attempt to incorporate it into theory. It is interesting to note that while research of the form “I observed this but I can’t explain it” would be nearly impossible to publish in any social science journal known to me, such anomalous observations often form the basis for scientific revolution (Kuhn, 1970)—such as the Michelson Morley experiment, which paved the way for Einstein’s special relativity. 
   We must never forget that our transdisciplinary mission demands that we view facilitating informing across the client disciplines as an important form of research. Providing a reader in one discipline with a novel perspective—even if that perspective is not necessarily novel in the discipline of the author—is a necessary part of transdisciplinary knowledge creation.   As a consequence of this expanded view of research, the journals and conferences sponsored by the ISI cover a very broad array of topics, research methods and styles of presentation.  
 3.2. Research Themes in Informing Science   
 Although much of the research in informing science does not fit within simple categories, there have been a number of themes that have captured the particular interest of researchers in the field. These include:  
 The nature of information and informing: | Beginning with a special issue on information science research (Spink, 2000), the ambiguity associated with the use of terms such as | information | , | data | and | knowledge | in different disciplines has been a frequent topic (e.g., Callaos & Callaos, 2002; Knox, 2009). 
  The nature of complexity and its impact on informing: | Efforts have been made both to define complexity more clearly (e.g., Gill & Hicks, 2006) and to better understand its impact on informing processes (e.g., Gill & Cohen, 2008). 
  Bridging the gap between research a practice: | Launched by another special issue (Fitzgerald, 2003), this topic of why academic research is so often ignored by practice has been frequently explored (e.g. Gill & Bhattacherjee, 2007) and is one where the informing science perspective has also started to gain practice in client disciplines (e.g., Myers et al., 2011). 
  The impact of content delivery (e.g., multimedia, web) on informing processes: | Examples include investigations of multimedia (e.g., Sharda, 2005), eLearning (e.g., Sarker & Nicholson, 2005) and adapting channels to highly restrictive informing environments (e.g., Spasic & Nesic, 2009). 
  Impact of bias, misinformation and disinformation on informing processes: | Both theoretical and practical research has been devoted to understanding the role played by bias (e.g., Jamieson & Hyland, 2006), misinformation (Bednar and Welch, 2008; Christozov, Chukova and Mateev, 2009) and deception (e.g., Hutchinson, 2006) in informing processes. 
  The role of adaptation in informing system design and construction: | Moving away from traditional MIS design models, such as the systems development lifecycle (SDLC), researchers have proposed drawing upon alternative metaphors, such as the double helix (e.g., Nissen, Bednar, & Welch, 2007), co-evolution (e.g., Pahl & Newnes, 2007), approaches grounded in philosophy (e.g., Bednar & Welch, 2009), and integrationist approaches such as the informing view of organization that bridges the MIS, and organization theory (Travica, 2014). 
  The need to broaden approaches to research within client disciplines: | Noting that positivist, empirical research methods do not necessarily yield useful results in many client disciplines, many researchers have proposed alternative approaches (e.g., Mende, 2005; Gill, 2011). 
  Consistent with its roots in the MIS and education client disciplines, many articles published in Informing Science: The International Journal of an Emerging Transdiscipline  represent the types of research that might also be publishable within the client disciplines themselves. By 2010, however, the editorial policy had evolved. The Editor-in-Chief of the journal commented on the current state of policy in the following statement (Gill, 2010, p. v):  
 We also continue to publish work from many different disciplines and, particularly welcome, see that many of our articles represent collaborations between authors coming from different disci-plines. Such broad representation and collaboration is the lifeblood of a transdiscipline. It is all too easy for a journal to gravitate towards a particular perspective on research. It is heartening to see that the authors submitting their work to InformSciJ are resisting that tendency.   I am also happy to report that the linkage between our research and the general problem of “informing” has grown much tighter over the past two years. While there was a time when Inform-SciJ would publish almost any high quality submission from its contributing disciplines (e.g., MIS, education, communications, philosophy, instructional technology), that is no longer the case. Today, every article we publish identifies how its topic relates to informing. I will admit that, in the past, I have been somewhat heavy-handed in enforcing that such a linkage be present. Recently, however, I have found authors increasingly taking it upon themselves to relate their findings to informing without my intervention. While the journal has missed the opportunity to publish some excellent work as a result, I am convinced that our long term interests are best served by being true to the central problem that we are studying.   As a consequence of the gradual adoption of this policy, recent volumes of the journal have become both slimmer and size and more directly focused on the journal's mission.  
 4. Informing Science Institute   
 The principal organizing body for the informing science transdiscipline is the Informing Science Institute  (ISI). According to a recent article (Murphy, in press):  
 Since its inception, it has published approximately 4,150 articles by over 4,500 authors from over 600 universities all across the globe.      
 Figure 5:  The activities of the Informing Science Institute  represented as an informing system (Murphy, 2011, p. 94). By Grandon.Gill - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=16232722   

 In that same article, the ISI's activities are described in informing system terms. These are illustrated in Figure 5. The ISI engages in a broad range of informing activities in support of the informing science transdiscipline. These include journal publications, organizing conferences, publishing books and offering services to members.  
 4.1. Journals   
 The ISI currently publishes thirteen journals, though two of these journals now function as passive repositories. Three of its journals are published in collaboration with other institutions. See Table 2 for a list of journals currently published solely by the ISI. These journals cover several common themes that have been established by the ISI. These include:  
 Free open access to the online version of every article is available as soon as each article is accepted for final publication and appropriately formatted 
  Articles are published under a Creative Commons license, allowing others to freely use their content (with proper attribution) 
  Printed volumes are produced and made available for sale at the end of each year 
  Double blind peer review is employed. Editors are required to make mentorship of both authors and reviewers a high priority throughout the review process, however. 
   
 Title | Specialization/Mission | Authors through 2019 | Articles through 2019 | Institutions through 2019 | Year Founded 
 1. Informing Science: The International Journal of an Emerging Transdiscipline | The flagship journal of the ISI, focusing on theory and practice of informing | 447 | 596 | 153 | 1998 
 2. Journal of Information Technology Education: Research | Serves the informational technology education audience on research-based issues | 845 | 978 | 328 | 2002 
 3. Journal of Information Technology Education: Innovations in Practice | Serves the informational technology education audience on issues in innovations in practice | 324 | 141 | 167 | 2002 
 4. Journal for the Study of Postsecondary and Tertiary Education | Considers issues in the advancement of higher and postsecondary education | 115 | 141 | 76 | 2016 
 5. Interdisciplinary Journal of E-Skills and Lifelong Learning | Considers instructional technology issues of informing | 433 | 619 | 162 | 2005 
 6. Interdisciplinary Journal of Information, Knowledge, and Management | Considers information and technology in organizations | 402 | 479 | 212 | 2006 
 7. International Journal of Doctoral Studies | Considers issues with informing doctoral students | 510 | 610 | 256 | 2006 
 8. Issues in Informing Science and Information Technology Journal | Covers IT in all other disciplines | 821 | 1294 | 250 | 2004 
  
 The Informing Science Institute also includes two journals that now function as passive repositories: Informing Faculty  and Journal of Information Technology: Discussion Cases  (JITE:DC). Informing Faculty  is a repository for discussion cases pertaining to challenges faced by faculty and administrators in higher education. JITE:DC is a repository for discussion cases in which information technology plays a key role in decision-making challenges (Murphy, in press).  
 Additionally, the Informing Science Institute publishes three partner journals in collaboration with other institutions.  
    
 Figure 6:  ISI Authorship by Country (Murphy, in press). By NSB123 - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=90204699   

 These are Muma Case Review  , Muma Business Review  , and International Journal of Community Development and Management Studies  . Partner journals agree to abide by the ISI's high standards for the treatment of authors and reviewers, but handle their own paper formatting and printing.  
 The ISI family of journals is also somewhat unusual for a U.S.-head quartered research publication in that a large percentage of its journals' editors and authors are situated outside of the United States. As shown in Figure 6, only about a third of its authors have been affiliated with U.S. academic institutions.  
 4.2. InSITE Conferences   
 One of the principal vehicles through which ISI informs its membership is through its Informing Science and IT Education  conferences, held at a different location during June of every year since 2001. Attendance is typically around 150 participants. Conferences to date have been located as follows (Informing Science Institute, 2020):  
 InSITE 2020 | - Online 
  InSITE 2019 - | Jerusalem, Israel 
  InSITE 2018 - | La Verne, California 
  InSITE 2017 - | Ho Chi Minh, Viet Nam 
  InSITE 2016 | - Vilnius, Lithuania 
  InSITE 2015 | - Tampa, Florida, USA 
  InSITE 2014 | - Wollongong, Australia 
  InSITE 2013 | - Porto, Portugal 
  InSITE 2012 | - Montreal, Canada 
  InSITE 2011 | - Novi Sad, Serbia 
  InSITE 2010 | - Cassino, Italy 
  InSITE 2009 | - Macon, Georgia, USA 
  InSITE 2008 | - Varna, Bulgaria 
  InSITE 2007 | - Ljubljana, Slovenia 
  InSITE 2006 | - Greater Manchester, England 
  InSITE 2005 | - Flagstaff, Arizona, USA 
  InSITE 2004 | - Rockhampton, Australia 
  InSITE 2003 | - Pori, Finland 
  InSITE 2002 | - Cork, Ireland 
  InSITE 2001 | - Kraków, Poland 
  Past conferences have included four primary tracks (Murphy, 2011, p. 117-118):  
 InSITE: Connect | consists of study in various locations on the transmission of information across time and across space. Connect focuses on the interrelationship between context (his-torical forces and culture) and information and knowledge transfer. 
  InSITE: Inform | solicits papers in any area that explores issues in effectively and efficiently informing clients through information technology (IT). 
  InSITE: TeachIT | focuses on research topics related to teaching IT, including curricular is-sues, capstone courses, pedagogy, and emerging topics in IT. 
  InSITE: TeLE | focuses on research topics related to using IT to teach. For example, these topics include e-Learning, m-Learning, making classroom teaching more effective, and distance learning. 
  ISI has instituted a "fast track" process for article submissions to InSITE conferences. After all conference submissions have been reviewed, the editor-in-chiefs of ISI's seven journals identify articles that are of particularly high quality and are also a good fit with the journal's mission. Authors of these articles are then offered the opportunity to revise their submission for publication in the journal rather than in the conference proceedings.  
 4.3. Informing Science Press   
 The Informing Science Press  is the publishing arm of the ISI and has published over 50 books, which are all available online for free on Google Books and are also available for purchase. Its catalog of books encompasses a wide range of subjects.  
 Topics covered by books published by the ISI press include, but are not limited to:  
 IT education 
  Instructional Technology 
  Informing Science 
  Informing Theory 
  Table 3 shows a list of topics on which books were published from the inception of the Informing Science Press through 2009.

 The Thirty-Fifth Annual Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence (IAAI-23) is a venue for papers describing highly innovative realizations of AI technology. The objective of the conference is to showcase successful applications and novel uses of AI. The conference will use technical papers, best practice papers, invited talks, and panel discussions to explore issues, methods, and lessons learned in the development and deployment of AI applications; and to promote an interchange of ideas between basic and applied AI and the discourse on the actual deployment of AI in practice. The general goal of the conference is to teach people the challenges and solutions to accomplishing something useful in the real world, as opposed to describing a new algorithm. Papers focusing on algorithmic descriptions, rather than applications, are more appropriate for AAAI-23. All submissions must be original.  
 IAAI-23 will consider: (1) papers that showcase novel, deployed applications of AI; (2) applications on a trajectory to deployment; (3) papers that present deployed tools for faster AI solutions development and deployment; (4) papers that showcase original ways of integrating methodologies from different areas of AI for practical realization and future deployment; and (5) best practice papers. Submissions should clearly identify which track they are intended for, as the tracks are judged on different criteria. All submissions must be original.  
 Tracks and Topics  
 1. Deployed Highly Innovative Applications of AI​   
 Papers submitted to this track must describe *deployed* applications with measurable benefits that include an innovative use of AI technology. Applications are defined as deployed once they are in production use by their final end-users and the in-use experience can be meaningfully collected and reported. The study may evaluate either a stand-alone application or a component of a complex system.  
 Papers will be judged by the quality of: the task or problem description; the application description; the innovative use of AI technology; the measurable application use and payoff; and the lessons learned during application development, deployment and maintenance. In-depth descriptions of the algorithm are generally more appropriate for AAAI than for IAAI. Each accepted deployed application paper will receive the IAAI ‘Innovative Application’ Award.  
 Papers in this track may have up to 8 pages in the prescribed AAAI style, plus at most one more page which may only contain references.  
 2. Emerging Applications of AI   
 Emerging applications papers ‘bridge the gap’ between basic AI research and case studies of deployed AI applications, by discussing efforts to apply AI tools, techniques, or methods to real-world problems in novel ways. Emerging applications focus on aspects of AI applications that are not yet sufficiently deployed to be submitted as case studies in the Deployed track.  
 This track is distinguished from reports of purely scientific AI research appropriate for AAAI in that the objective of the efforts reported at IAAI should be the potential application of AI technologies, including engineering considerations. A key requirement for papers is to discuss the path forward for achieving deployment of the technology.  
 Papers will be judged primarily by the following criteria: significance (of the problem, and the tool or methodology); relevance of AI technology to the problem; innovation; path to deployment; content; evaluation; technical quality; and clarity. Authors are advised to bear these questions in mind while writing their papers. Authors are also advised to consider the novelty of applying AI to the particular problem domain.  
 Papers in this track may have up to 6 pages in the prescribed AAAI style, plus at most one more page which may only contain references.  
 3. Deployed Innovative Tools for Enabling AI Applications   
 Within this track, we solicit papers describing *deployed* tools for improving applied AI innovation and deployment of AI systems. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Process organization: Tools that help manage and assure the development, evaluation or deployment of AI systems. 
  Data cleaning: Tools to ease the pain point of processing raw data for its use in AI systems. 
  Modelling: Tools that facilitate AI modelling, for example approaches to facilitate deriving models from examples or demonstrations. 
  Meta-algorithmics: Tools to improve AI systems, algorithm configurators, algorithm portfolios, and hyper-parameter tuners. 
  Platforms: Tools in the form of platforms designed for AI research, especially those with connections to real world systems and domains. 
  Novel computational models: Tools to exploit new computational hardware, for example neuromorphic co-processors, quantum computers, and chips approximating quantum computation. 
  Interaction: Tools that facilitate the interaction design of or user experience with AI systems or improve user evaluations. 
  Trusted AI: Tools that generate explanations, justifications, and persuasions for data-driven models. 
  Papers will be judged primarily by the following criteria: the extent to which the tool presented yields solutions with demonstrated improved quality; lower development, deployment, and maintenance costs; better productivity; fewer errors; and higher ability to scale. Reviewers will pay attention to how well designed is the tool, how easy is it to use and how well is it documented, and how many users it has. Note the focus is on the tool, not on foundational research.  
 Papers in this track may have up to 6 pages in the prescribed AAAI style, plus at most one more page which may only contain references.  
 4. Innovative Inter-disciplinary AI Integration   
 This track is devoted to the integration of AI components with the focus on how the orchestration of methods from different AI silos requires the adaptation of existing technologies to allow them to work together well for application of AI in practice. Papers must pay attention to engineering considerations and, where relevant, to human–computer interaction.  
 Examples for such orchestrated new capabilities and applications include but are not limited to:  
 Learning search algorithms: Implementations of systematic and heuristic search algorithms that are capable to improve their performance by learning from experience or during search. 
  Decision support under uncertainty: Implementations that combine statistical and deterministic reasoning to provide scalable decision support under uncertainty for applications that are inherently stochastic. 
  Knowledge representation: Representations that work effectively for downstream analytics, e.g., the innovative use of a knowledge graph for feature generation of a downstream machine learning model. 
  Auto-configuration: The adaptation of search methods from combinatorial optimization to optimize knowledge bases or to design superior forecasting algorithms. 
  Other research prototypes that integrate algorithms and methods from traditionally different AI sub-communities. 
  A clear, objectively the value of the innovation of the integration when compared to existing or ad-hoc approaches. Computational experiments on benchmarks (that either already are or will be made public) and in comparison, with existing state-of-the-art baseline methods are expected. At least a portion of the experiments is expected to consider real-world (not synthetic generated) benchmarks to demonstrate the practical importance of the problem studied.  
 Papers in this track may have up to 6 pages in the prescribed AAAI style, plus at most one more page which may only contain references.  
 5. AI Best Practices, Challenge Problems, Training AI Users   
 In this short paper track, we welcome papers that review best practices when deploying AI, that communicate novel challenge applications, and that review contributions that lower the barrier to applying AI by practitioners outside the AI community. These papers will be reviewed based on different criteria than the longer papers of the main IAAI tracks. Best practice papers must tie the recommendations to concrete learning from prior experience when deploying AI methods. Challenge problem papers *must* make non-generated, real-world data benchmarks publicly available (this is a hard requirement). AI training papers must focus on the particular challenges when bridging knowledge from application domain experts and AI expertise and how the domain experts can effectively and efficiently learn enough about the AI tools, they use to apply them successfully. For all topics in the scope of this track, papers that challenge the status quo are particularly welcome.  
 Papers in this track may be between four (4) pages and (6) pages long, including references, in the prescribed AAAI style.

 Title:  Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs):14th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science Conference (ITCS 2023)    

 The edit distance between strings classically assigns unit cost to every character insertion, deletion, and substitution, whereas the Hamming distance only allows substitutions. In many real-life scenarios, insertions and deletions (abbreviated indels) appear frequently but significantly less so than substitutions. To model this, we consider substitutions being cheaper than indels, with cost 1/a for a parameter a ≥ 1. This basic variant, denoted ED_a, bridges classical edit distance (a = 1) with Hamming distance (a → ∞), leading to interesting algorithmic challenges: Does the time complexity of computing ED_a interpolate between that of Hamming distance (linear time) and edit distance (quadratic time)? What about approximating ED_a? We first present a simple deterministic exact algorithm for ED_a and further prove that it is near-optimal assuming the Orthogonal Vectors Conjecture. Our main result is a randomized algorithm computing a (1+ε)-approximation of ED_a(X,Y), given strings X,Y of total length n and a bound k ≥ ED_a(X,Y). For simplicity, let us focus on k ≥ 1 and a constant ε > 0; then, our algorithm takes Õ(n/a + ak³) time. Unless a = Õ(1), in which case ED_a resembles the standard edit distance, and for the most interesting regime of small enough k, this running time is sublinear in n. We also consider a very natural version that asks to find a (k_I, k_S)-alignment, i.e., an alignment with at most k_I indels and k_S substitutions. In this setting, we give an exact algorithm and, more importantly, an Õ((nk_I)/k_S + k_S k_I³)-time (1,1+ε)-bicriteria approximation algorithm. The latter solution is based on the techniques we develop for ED_a for a = Θ(k_S/k_I), and its running time is again sublinear in n whenever k_I ≪ k_S and the overall distance is small enough. These bounds are in stark contrast to unit-cost edit distance, where state-of-the-art algorithms are far from achieving (1+ε)-approximation in sublinear time, even for a favorable choice of k.  more »  « less

 Approximating Edit Distance in Truly Subquadratic Time: Quantum and MapReduce    https://doi.org/10.1145/3456807     Boroujeni, Mahdi  ;  Ehsani, Soheil  ;  Ghodsi, Mohammad  ;  Hajiaghayi, Mohammadtaghi  ;  Seddighin, Saeed   ( May 2021  , Journal of the ACM)   null  (Ed.)  The edit distance between two strings is defined as the smallest number of insertions , deletions , and substitutions that need to be made to transform one of the strings to another one. Approximating edit distance in subquadratic time is “one of the biggest unsolved problems in the field of combinatorial pattern matching” [37]. Our main result is a quantum constant approximation algorithm for computing the edit distance in truly subquadratic time. More precisely, we give an quantum algorithm that approximates the edit distance within a factor of 3. We further extend this result to an quantum algorithm that approximates the edit distance within a larger constant factor. Our solutions are based on a framework for approximating edit distance in parallel settings. This framework requires as black box an algorithm that computes the distances of several smaller strings all at once. For a quantum algorithm, we reduce the black box to metric estimation and provide efficient algorithms for approximating it. We further show that this framework enables us to approximate edit distance in distributed settings. To this end, we provide a MapReduce algorithm to approximate edit distance within a factor of , with sublinearly many machines and sublinear memory. Also, our algorithm runs in a logarithmic number of rounds.  more »  « less 
  Bit Complexity of Jordan Normal Form and Polynomial Spectral Factorization    Dey, Papri  ;  Kannan, Ravi  ;  Ryder, Nick  ;  Srivastava, Nikhil   ( January 2023  , 14th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science Conference (ITCS 2023))   We study the bit complexity of two related fundamental computational problems in linear algebra and control theory. Our results are: (1) An Õ(n^{ω+3}a+n⁴a²+n^ωlog(1/ε)) time algorithm for finding an ε-approximation to the Jordan Normal form of an integer matrix with a-bit entries, where ω is the exponent of matrix multiplication. (2) An Õ(n⁶d⁶a+n⁴d⁴a²+n³d³log(1/ε)) time algorithm for ε-approximately computing the spectral factorization P(x) = Q^*(x)Q(x) of a given monic n× n rational matrix polynomial of degree 2d with rational a-bit coefficients having a-bit common denominators, which satisfies P(x)⪰0 for all real x. The first algorithm is used as a subroutine in the second one. Despite its being of central importance, polynomial complexity bounds were not previously known for spectral factorization, and for Jordan form the best previous best running time was an unspecified polynomial in n of degree at least twelve [Cai, 1994]. Our algorithms are simple and judiciously combine techniques from numerical and symbolic computation, yielding significant advantages over either approach by itself.  more »  « less 
  Fast Approximate Counting of Cycles    https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ICALP.2024.37     Censor-Hillel, Keren  ;  Even, Tomer  ;  Vassilevska_Williams, Virginia   ( January 2024  , Schloss Dagstuhl – Leibniz-Zentrum für Informatik)   Bringmann, Karl  ;  Grohe, Martin  ;  Puppis, Gabriele  ;  Svensson, Ola  (Ed.)  We consider the problem of approximate counting of triangles and longer fixed length cycles in directed graphs. For triangles, Tětek [ICALP'22] gave an algorithm that returns a (1±ε)-approximation in Õ(n^ω/t^{ω-2}) time, where t is the unknown number of triangles in the given n node graph and ω < 2.372 is the matrix multiplication exponent. We obtain an improved algorithm whose running time is, within polylogarithmic factors the same as that for multiplying an n× n/t matrix by an n/t × n matrix. We then extend our framework to obtain the first nontrivial (1± ε)-approximation algorithms for the number of h-cycles in a graph, for any constant h ≥ 3. Our running time is Õ(MM(n,n/t^{1/(h-2)},n)), the time to multiply n × n/(t^{1/(h-2)}) by n/(t^{1/(h-2)) × n matrices. Finally, we show that under popular fine-grained hypotheses, this running time is optimal.  more »  « less 
  Polylogarithmic Sketches for Clustering    https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ICALP.2022.38     Charikar, Moses  ;  Waingarten, Erik   ( January 2022  , Schloss Dagstuhl – Leibniz-Zentrum für Informatik)   Bojańczyk, Mikołaj  ;  Merelli, Emanuela  ;  Woodruff, David P  (Ed.)  Given n points in 𝓁_p^d, we consider the problem of partitioning points into k clusters with associated centers. The cost of a clustering is the sum of p-th powers of distances of points to their cluster centers. For p ∈ [1,2], we design sketches of size poly(log(nd),k,1/ε) such that the cost of the optimal clustering can be estimated to within factor 1+ε, despite the fact that the compressed representation does not contain enough information to recover the cluster centers or the partition into clusters. This leads to a streaming algorithm for estimating the clustering cost with space poly(log(nd),k,1/ε). We also obtain a distributed memory algorithm, where the n points are arbitrarily partitioned amongst m machines, each of which sends information to a central party who then computes an approximation of the clustering cost. Prior to this work, no such streaming or distributed-memory algorithm was known with sublinear dependence on d for p ∈ [1,2).  more »  « less 
  Near-linear time insertion-deletion codes and (1+ ε)-approximating edit distance via indexing    https://doi.org/10.1145/3313276.3316371     Haeupler, Bernhard  ;  Rubinstein, Aviad  ;  Shahrasbi, Amirbehshad   ( April 2019  , ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing)   We introduce fast-decodable indexing schemes for edit distance which can be used to speed up edit distance computations to near-linear time if one of the strings is indexed by an indexing string I. In particular, for every length n and every ε >0, one can in near linear time construct a string I ∈ Σ′n with |Σ′| = Oε(1), such that, indexing any string S ∈ Σn, symbol-by-symbol, with I results in a string S′ ∈ Σ″n where Σ″ = Σ × Σ′ for which edit distance computations are easy, i.e., one can compute a (1+ε)-approximation of the edit distance between S′ and any other string in O(n (log n)) time. Our indexing schemes can be used to improve the decoding complexity of state-of-the-art error correcting codes for insertions and deletions. In particular, they lead to near-linear time decoding algorithms for the insertion-deletion codes of [Haeupler, Shahrasbi; STOC ‘17] and faster decoding algorithms for list-decodable insertion-deletion codes of [Haeupler, Shahrasbi, Sudan; ICALP ‘18]. Interestingly, the latter codes are a crucial ingredient in the construction of fast-decodable indexing schemes.  more »  « less

 Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence Conference (IAAI)  
  January 29, 2023   
  
 Sponsored by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence  
 Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence Conferences (IAAI) traditionally consist of case studies of deployed applications with measurable benefits whose value depends on the use of AI technology. In addition, many IAAI conferences augment these case studies with papers and invited talks that address emerging areas of AI technology or applications. IAAI is organized as an independent program within the AAAI National Conference, with schedules coordinated to allow attendees to move freely between IAAI and AAAI Conference sessions. IAAI and the National Conference often jointly sponsor invited talks that fit the theme of both programs  
 Future Conferences  
 The Thirty-Seventh Annual Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence  will be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. IAAI-25 is co-located with AAAI-25. Check back shortly for additional details.

   1.  ERCIM's oldest active Working Group   
 Following an initial successful workshop bringing together ERCIM members interested in formal verification, held in Pisa in December 1992 Stefania Gnesi and Diego Latella, CNR, Pisa proposed to create an ERCIM working group dedicated to Formal Methods for Industrial Critical Systems (FMICS). Although at that time model checking was in its early days, the early ERCIM FMICS community was already aware of the great potential of formal verification techniques.  
 Since then, the WG, chaired in succession by Diego Latella (ISTI-CNR), Hubert Garavel (INRIA), Stefania Gnesi (ISTI), Pedro Merino (SparCIM), Alessandro Fantechi (ISTI), Radu Mateescu (INRIA), and Tiziana Margaria (LERO), has kept pace with the development of formal verification techniques - and model checking in particular. The series of annual workshops, began in 1996 and sponsored by the WG, have promoted an ongoing scientific discussion focussed on identifying the most efficient verification techniques, with a keen eye to their industrial applicability. Most of the members of the FMICS community have strong links with industry and have thus contributed to the slow but constant introduction of formal methods in the development cycle of industrial critical systems witnessed in the last decade. The WG has also addressed other readily applicable verification techniques, such as static analysis by abstract interpretation. Similarly, the whole formal development lifecycle has been addressed, for example in the 2008 FMICS workshop where considerable attention was paid to the recent diffusion of Model Driven Development in industry.  
 In 2008, issue number 75 of the ERCIM News  hosted a joint special session edited by Pedro Merino, coordinator of the WG, and Erwin Schoitsch, coordinator of the DES Dependable Embedded System WG, featuring almost 30 articles many of which reporting advances on the application of formal methods in industry.  
 The FMICS workshop series has always been open to contributions from outside the ERCIM community and strong links have been maintained with other organizations, such as Formal Methods Europe. In November 2009, the FMICS workshop was held during the FM week, a special gathering of events organized this year by the FME association.  
  2.  Background   
 Formal methods have been advocated as a means of increasing the reliability of systems, especially those which are safety or business critical, but the industrial uptake of such methods has been slow. This is due to the perceived difficulty of mathematical nature of these methods, the lack of tool support, and the lack of precedents where formal methods has been proven to be effective. It is even more difficult to develop automatic specification and verification tools due to limitations like state explosion, undecidability, etc. This working group will bring together researchers of the ERCIM consortium in order to promote the use of formal methods within industry.  
 The behaviour of reactive systems is largely conditioned by the interaction with events of the external environment the sequentialization of which is not predictable. The complexity of the systems' behaviour increases considerably when the timing dependencies in the execution of events are taken into account.  
 The above features are typical of a large class of systems including control systems, automation systems, and communication systems and results in the extreme difficulty of the verification of their correctness.  
 In the industrial context correctness verification is usually performed by means of testing; the system is provided with input sequences drawn from a proper "coverage set" and its resulting behaviour is observed.  
 Due to the multiplicity of possibilities both for inputs to a system and originating from more and more use of parallelism and concurrency this approach turns out to be very costly and in any case it does not allow for the exhaustive verification of the correctness of the system. It allows only to detect errors which take place during the execution sequences used for the test.  
 In the last decade several theories have been developed which aim at coping with the problem of systems correctness by means of formal methodologies for the specification, design and verification of systems. These theories have been extended in order to deal with time, probability and stochastic aspects of behaviours.  
 Also real-time models where time is a dense quantity and verification can be done algorithmically (automatically) has been developed.  
 More recently, international standards for safety recommend the use of such methodologies, especially for critical systems.  
 Nevertheless, the use of formal methods in the industry is still quite limited. Apparently, major reasons for that are the notational difficulty of most formal methods available nowdays and the lack of integration between them. Notational complexity is often a deterrent to the use of formal methods stronger than the advantages of such methods. This is reinforced by the lack of models which support all the activities of system development:  
 requirements specification 
  validation of the specification 
  design 
  verification of the final product against the requirements 
  For each of the above activities different techniques have been developed independently. They are usually not at all integrated neither compatible and quite often they have been tried only on toy-examples, bringing to results which are rather difficult to compare. Finally, most of the automatic tools developed for supporting the use of formal methods lack of industrial strength and so turn out to be unpractical when used in the industrial context.  
  3.  Objectives   
 The main objectives of the WG are: To bring together scientists mainly of, but not only of institutions within ERCIM who are active in the field of formal methods and are willing to exchange their experience in the industrial usage of formal methods. 
  To coordinate efforts in the transfer of the formal methods technology and knowledge to the industry. 
  To promote research and development for the improvement of formal methods and tools with respect to their usage in the industry. 
  The above objectives will be met by means of: Workshops where the participation of industrial professionals will be solicited. 
  Development projects with industrial partners. 
  Research projects and researchers mobility.

 The Thirty-Sixth Annual Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence (IAAI-24) February 22-24,2024  
 The Thirty-Sixth Annual Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence (IAAI-24) is a venue for papers describing highly innovative realizations of AI technology. The objective of the conference is to showcase successful applications and novel uses of AI. The conference will use technical papers, best practice papers, invited talks, and panel discussions to explore issues, methods, and lessons learned in the development and deployment of AI applications; and to promote an interchange of ideas between basic and applied AI and the discourse on the actual deployment of AI in practice. The general goal of the conference is to teach people the challenges and solutions to accomplishing something useful in the real world, as opposed to describing a new algorithm.  
   
 IAAI-24 Schedule    
   
 Tracks with Accepted Papers  
  Deployed Highly Innovative Applications of AI​  
 Papers submitted to this track must describe deployed applications with measurable benefits that include an innovative use of AI technology. Applications are defined as deployed once they are in production use by their final end-users and the in-use experience can be meaningfully collected and reported. The study may evaluate either a stand-alone application or a component of a complex system.

 Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA 2023)  

  IDA 2023 will take place at UCLouvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, 12-14 April 2023.  
  Advancing Intelligent Data Analysis  requires novel, potentially game-changing ideas. IDA’s mission is to promote ideas over performance: a solid motivation can be as convincing as exhaustive empirical evaluation. Therefore IDA accepts all inspiring papers for both presentation and publication. In order to create an open atmosphere that encourages discussion, the IDA symposium is intentionally small-scale and single-track.  
 The program of the symposium is now available: Full Program  .  
 Early registration is possible till March 25, 2023.

   1.  ERCIM's oldest active Working Group   
 Following an initial successful workshop bringing together ERCIM members interested in formal verification, held in Pisa in December 1992 Stefania Gnesi and Diego Latella, CNR, Pisa proposed to create an ERCIM working group dedicated to Formal Methods for Industrial Critical Systems (FMICS). Although at that time model checking was in its early days, the early ERCIM FMICS community was already aware of the great potential of formal verification techniques.  
 Since then, the WG, chaired in succession by Diego Latella (ISTI-CNR), Hubert Garavel (INRIA), Stefania Gnesi (ISTI), Pedro Merino (SparCIM), Alessandro Fantechi (ISTI), Radu Mateescu (INRIA), and Tiziana Margaria (LERO), has kept pace with the development of formal verification techniques - and model checking in particular. The series of annual workshops, began in 1996 and sponsored by the WG, have promoted an ongoing scientific discussion focussed on identifying the most efficient verification techniques, with a keen eye to their industrial applicability. Most of the members of the FMICS community have strong links with industry and have thus contributed to the slow but constant introduction of formal methods in the development cycle of industrial critical systems witnessed in the last decade. The WG has also addressed other readily applicable verification techniques, such as static analysis by abstract interpretation. Similarly, the whole formal development lifecycle has been addressed, for example in the 2008 FMICS workshop where considerable attention was paid to the recent diffusion of Model Driven Development in industry.  
 In 2008, issue number 75 of the ERCIM News  hosted a joint special session edited by Pedro Merino, coordinator of the WG, and Erwin Schoitsch, coordinator of the DES Dependable Embedded System WG, featuring almost 30 articles many of which reporting advances on the application of formal methods in industry.  
 The FMICS workshop series has always been open to contributions from outside the ERCIM community and strong links have been maintained with other organizations, such as Formal Methods Europe. In November 2009, the FMICS workshop was held during the FM week, a special gathering of events organized this year by the FME association.  
  2.  Background   
 Formal methods have been advocated as a means of increasing the reliability of systems, especially those which are safety or business critical, but the industrial uptake of such methods has been slow. This is due to the perceived difficulty of mathematical nature of these methods, the lack of tool support, and the lack of precedents where formal methods has been proven to be effective. It is even more difficult to develop automatic specification and verification tools due to limitations like state explosion, undecidability, etc. This working group will bring together researchers of the ERCIM consortium in order to promote the use of formal methods within industry.  
 The behaviour of reactive systems is largely conditioned by the interaction with events of the external environment the sequentialization of which is not predictable. The complexity of the systems' behaviour increases considerably when the timing dependencies in the execution of events are taken into account.  
 The above features are typical of a large class of systems including control systems, automation systems, and communication systems and results in the extreme difficulty of the verification of their correctness.  
 In the industrial context correctness verification is usually performed by means of testing; the system is provided with input sequences drawn from a proper "coverage set" and its resulting behaviour is observed.  
 Due to the multiplicity of possibilities both for inputs to a system and originating from more and more use of parallelism and concurrency this approach turns out to be very costly and in any case it does not allow for the exhaustive verification of the correctness of the system. It allows only to detect errors which take place during the execution sequences used for the test.  
 In the last decade several theories have been developed which aim at coping with the problem of systems correctness by means of formal methodologies for the specification, design and verification of systems. These theories have been extended in order to deal with time, probability and stochastic aspects of behaviours.  
 Also real-time models where time is a dense quantity and verification can be done algorithmically (automatically) has been developed.  
 More recently, international standards for safety recommend the use of such methodologies, especially for critical systems.  
 Nevertheless, the use of formal methods in the industry is still quite limited. Apparently, major reasons for that are the notational difficulty of most formal methods available nowdays and the lack of integration between them. Notational complexity is often a deterrent to the use of formal methods stronger than the advantages of such methods. This is reinforced by the lack of models which support all the activities of system development:  
 requirements specification 
  validation of the specification 
  design 
  verification of the final product against the requirements 
  For each of the above activities different techniques have been developed independently. They are usually not at all integrated neither compatible and quite often they have been tried only on toy-examples, bringing to results which are rather difficult to compare. Finally, most of the automatic tools developed for supporting the use of formal methods lack of industrial strength and so turn out to be unpractical when used in the industrial context.  
  3.  Objectives   
 The main objectives of the WG are: To bring together scientists mainly of, but not only of institutions within ERCIM who are active in the field of formal methods and are willing to exchange their experience in the industrial usage of formal methods. 
  To coordinate efforts in the transfer of the formal methods technology and knowledge to the industry. 
  To promote research and development for the improvement of formal methods and tools with respect to their usage in the industry. 
  The above objectives will be met by means of: Workshops where the participation of industrial professionals will be solicited. 
  Development projects with industrial partners. 
  Research projects and researchers mobility.

   1.  ERCIM's oldest active Working Group   
 Following an initial successful workshop bringing together ERCIM members interested in formal verification, held in Pisa in December 1992 Stefania Gnesi and Diego Latella, CNR, Pisa proposed to create an ERCIM working group dedicated to Formal Methods for Industrial Critical Systems (FMICS). Although at that time model checking was in its early days, the early ERCIM FMICS community was already aware of the great potential of formal verification techniques.  
 Since then, the WG, chaired in succession by Diego Latella (ISTI-CNR), Hubert Garavel (INRIA), Stefania Gnesi (ISTI), Pedro Merino (SparCIM), Alessandro Fantechi (ISTI), Radu Mateescu (INRIA), and Tiziana Margaria (LERO), has kept pace with the development of formal verification techniques - and model checking in particular. The series of annual workshops, began in 1996 and sponsored by the WG, have promoted an ongoing scientific discussion focussed on identifying the most efficient verification techniques, with a keen eye to their industrial applicability. Most of the members of the FMICS community have strong links with industry and have thus contributed to the slow but constant introduction of formal methods in the development cycle of industrial critical systems witnessed in the last decade. The WG has also addressed other readily applicable verification techniques, such as static analysis by abstract interpretation. Similarly, the whole formal development lifecycle has been addressed, for example in the 2008 FMICS workshop where considerable attention was paid to the recent diffusion of Model Driven Development in industry.  
 In 2008, issue number 75 of the ERCIM News  hosted a joint special session edited by Pedro Merino, coordinator of the WG, and Erwin Schoitsch, coordinator of the DES Dependable Embedded System WG, featuring almost 30 articles many of which reporting advances on the application of formal methods in industry.  
 The FMICS workshop series has always been open to contributions from outside the ERCIM community and strong links have been maintained with other organizations, such as Formal Methods Europe. In November 2009, the FMICS workshop was held during the FM week, a special gathering of events organized this year by the FME association.  
  2.  Background   
 Formal methods have been advocated as a means of increasing the reliability of systems, especially those which are safety or business critical, but the industrial uptake of such methods has been slow. This is due to the perceived difficulty of mathematical nature of these methods, the lack of tool support, and the lack of precedents where formal methods has been proven to be effective. It is even more difficult to develop automatic specification and verification tools due to limitations like state explosion, undecidability, etc. This working group will bring together researchers of the ERCIM consortium in order to promote the use of formal methods within industry.  
 The behaviour of reactive systems is largely conditioned by the interaction with events of the external environment the sequentialization of which is not predictable. The complexity of the systems' behaviour increases considerably when the timing dependencies in the execution of events are taken into account.  
 The above features are typical of a large class of systems including control systems, automation systems, and communication systems and results in the extreme difficulty of the verification of their correctness.  
 In the industrial context correctness verification is usually performed by means of testing; the system is provided with input sequences drawn from a proper "coverage set" and its resulting behaviour is observed.  
 Due to the multiplicity of possibilities both for inputs to a system and originating from more and more use of parallelism and concurrency this approach turns out to be very costly and in any case it does not allow for the exhaustive verification of the correctness of the system. It allows only to detect errors which take place during the execution sequences used for the test.  
 In the last decade several theories have been developed which aim at coping with the problem of systems correctness by means of formal methodologies for the specification, design and verification of systems. These theories have been extended in order to deal with time, probability and stochastic aspects of behaviours.  
 Also real-time models where time is a dense quantity and verification can be done algorithmically (automatically) has been developed.  
 More recently, international standards for safety recommend the use of such methodologies, especially for critical systems.  
 Nevertheless, the use of formal methods in the industry is still quite limited. Apparently, major reasons for that are the notational difficulty of most formal methods available nowdays and the lack of integration between them. Notational complexity is often a deterrent to the use of formal methods stronger than the advantages of such methods. This is reinforced by the lack of models which support all the activities of system development:  
 requirements specification 
  validation of the specification 
  design 
  verification of the final product against the requirements 
  For each of the above activities different techniques have been developed independently. They are usually not at all integrated neither compatible and quite often they have been tried only on toy-examples, bringing to results which are rather difficult to compare. Finally, most of the automatic tools developed for supporting the use of formal methods lack of industrial strength and so turn out to be unpractical when used in the industrial context.  
  3.  Objectives   
 The main objectives of the WG are: To bring together scientists mainly of, but not only of institutions within ERCIM who are active in the field of formal methods and are willing to exchange their experience in the industrial usage of formal methods. 
  To coordinate efforts in the transfer of the formal methods technology and knowledge to the industry. 
  To promote research and development for the improvement of formal methods and tools with respect to their usage in the industry. 
  The above objectives will be met by means of: Workshops where the participation of industrial professionals will be solicited. 
  Development projects with industrial partners. 
  Research projects and researchers mobility.

  Aims & Scope  
 Intelligent Data Analysis  provides a forum for the examination of issues related to the research and applications of Artificial Intelligence techniques in data analysis across a variety of disciplines. These techniques include (but are not limited to): all areas of data visualization, data pre-processing (fusion, editing, transformation, filtering, sampling), data engineering, database mining techniques, tools and applications, use of domain knowledge in data analysis, big data applications, evolutionary algorithms, machine learning, neural nets, fuzzy logic, statistical pattern recognition, knowledge filtering, and post-processing. In particular, papers are preferred that discuss the development of new AI-related data analysis architectures, methodologies, and techniques and their applications to various domains.  
 Papers published in this journal are geared heavily towards applications, with an anticipated split of 70% of the papers published being applications-oriented, research and the remaining 30% containing more theoretical research. Manuscripts should be submitted in PDF format only. Please prepare your manuscripts in single-space, and include figures and tables in the body of the text where they are referred to. For all enquiries regarding the submission of your manuscript please contact the IDA journal editor: editor1@ida-ij.com

 PREPARATION OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 Organization of the paper and style of presentation   
  Manuscripts must be written in English. Authors whose native language is not English are advised to consult a professional English language editing service or a native English speaker prior to submission.  
 Manuscripts should be prepared with wide margins and double (single) spacing throughout, including the abstract, footnotes and references. Manuscripts should be submitted in *.pdf format only. Every page of the manuscript, including the title page, references, tables, etc., should be numbered. However, in the text no reference should be made to page numbers; if necessary, one may refer to sections. Try to avoid the excessive use of italics and bold face.  
 Manuscripts should be organized in the following order:  
 Title page  
 Body of text (divided by subheadings) + Tables, Figures and Figure captions  
 Acknowledgements  
 References  
 Headings and subheadings should be numbered and typed on a separate line, without indentation.  
 SI units should be used, i.e., the units based on the metre, kilogramme, second, etc.  
 Title page   
  The title page should provide the following information:  
 Title (should be clear, descriptive and not too long)  
 Name(s) of author(s); please indicate who is the corresponding author  
 Full affiliation(s)  
 Present address of author(s), if different from affiliation  
 Complete address of corresponding author, including tel. no., fax no. and e-mail address  
 Abstract; should be clear, descriptive, self-explanatory and not longer than 200 words, it should also be suitable for publication in abstracting services  
 Keywords  
 Tables   
   
  Figures and Tables  
   
  Number as Table 1, Table 2 etc, and refer to all of them in the text.  
   
  Figures and Tables should be included in the text in the exact location where they are referred to.  
   
  Each table should have a brief and self-explanatory title.  
   
  Column headings should be brief, but sufficiently explanatory. Standard abbreviations of units of measurement should be added between parentheses.  
   
  Vertical lines should not be used to separate columns. Leave some extra space between the columns instead.  
   
  Any explanations essential to the understanding of the table should be given in footnotes at the bottom of the table.  
 REFERENCES   
 Place citations as numbers in square brackets in the text. All publications cited in the text should be presented in an alphabetical list of references at the end of the manuscript in the following style:  
 [1] B. Newman and E.T. Liu, Perspective on BRCA1, Breast Disease  10  (1998), 3-10.  
  [2] D.F. Pilkey, Happy conservation laws, in: Neural Stresses  , J. Frost, ed., Controlled Press, Georgia, 1995, pp. 332-391.  
  [3] E. Wilson, Active vibration analysis of thin-walled beam  s, Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Virginia, 1991.  
 Footnotes   
  Footnotes should only be used if absolutely essential. In most cases it is possible to incorporate the information in the text.  
 If used, they should be numbered in the text, indicated by superscript numbers and kept as short as possible. 
  Figures   
 Number figures as Fig. 1, Fig. 2, etc and refer to all of them in the text.  
 Each figure should be provided on a separate sheet. Figures should not be included in the text.  
 Colour figures can be included, provided the cost of their reproduction is paid for by the author.  
 For the file formats of the figures please take the following into account:  
 Line art should be have a minimum resolution of 600 dpi, save as EPS or TIFF  
 Grayscales (incl photos) should have a minimum resolution of 300 dpi (no lettering), or 500 dpi (when there is lettering); save as tiff  
 Do not save figures as JPEG, this format may lose information in the process  
 Do not use figures taken from the Internet, the resolution will be too low for printing  
 Do not use colour in your figures if they are to be printed in black & white, as this will reduce the print quality (note that in software often the default is colour, you should change the settings)  
 For figures that should be printed in colour, please send a CMYK encoded EPS or TIFF  
 Figures should be designed with the format of the page of the journal in mind. They should be of such a size as to allow a reduction of 50%.  
 On maps and other figures where a scale is needed, use bar scales rather than numerical ones, i.e., do not use scales of the type 1:10,000. This avoids problems if the figures need to be reduced.  
 Each figure should have a self-explanatory caption. The captions to all figures should be typed on a separate sheet of the manuscript.  
 Photographs are only acceptable if they have good contrast and intensity.

   1.  ERCIM's oldest active Working Group   
 Following an initial successful workshop bringing together ERCIM members interested in formal verification, held in Pisa in December 1992 Stefania Gnesi and Diego Latella, CNR, Pisa proposed to create an ERCIM working group dedicated to Formal Methods for Industrial Critical Systems (FMICS). Although at that time model checking was in its early days, the early ERCIM FMICS community was already aware of the great potential of formal verification techniques.  
 Since then, the WG, chaired in succession by Diego Latella (ISTI-CNR), Hubert Garavel (INRIA), Stefania Gnesi (ISTI), Pedro Merino (SparCIM), Alessandro Fantechi (ISTI), Radu Mateescu (INRIA), and Tiziana Margaria (LERO), has kept pace with the development of formal verification techniques - and model checking in particular. The series of annual workshops, began in 1996 and sponsored by the WG, have promoted an ongoing scientific discussion focussed on identifying the most efficient verification techniques, with a keen eye to their industrial applicability. Most of the members of the FMICS community have strong links with industry and have thus contributed to the slow but constant introduction of formal methods in the development cycle of industrial critical systems witnessed in the last decade. The WG has also addressed other readily applicable verification techniques, such as static analysis by abstract interpretation. Similarly, the whole formal development lifecycle has been addressed, for example in the 2008 FMICS workshop where considerable attention was paid to the recent diffusion of Model Driven Development in industry.  
 In 2008, issue number 75 of the ERCIM News  hosted a joint special session edited by Pedro Merino, coordinator of the WG, and Erwin Schoitsch, coordinator of the DES Dependable Embedded System WG, featuring almost 30 articles many of which reporting advances on the application of formal methods in industry.  
 The FMICS workshop series has always been open to contributions from outside the ERCIM community and strong links have been maintained with other organizations, such as Formal Methods Europe. In November 2009, the FMICS workshop was held during the FM week, a special gathering of events organized this year by the FME association.  
  2.  Background   
 Formal methods have been advocated as a means of increasing the reliability of systems, especially those which are safety or business critical, but the industrial uptake of such methods has been slow. This is due to the perceived difficulty of mathematical nature of these methods, the lack of tool support, and the lack of precedents where formal methods has been proven to be effective. It is even more difficult to develop automatic specification and verification tools due to limitations like state explosion, undecidability, etc. This working group will bring together researchers of the ERCIM consortium in order to promote the use of formal methods within industry.  
 The behaviour of reactive systems is largely conditioned by the interaction with events of the external environment the sequentialization of which is not predictable. The complexity of the systems' behaviour increases considerably when the timing dependencies in the execution of events are taken into account.  
 The above features are typical of a large class of systems including control systems, automation systems, and communication systems and results in the extreme difficulty of the verification of their correctness.  
 In the industrial context correctness verification is usually performed by means of testing; the system is provided with input sequences drawn from a proper "coverage set" and its resulting behaviour is observed.  
 Due to the multiplicity of possibilities both for inputs to a system and originating from more and more use of parallelism and concurrency this approach turns out to be very costly and in any case it does not allow for the exhaustive verification of the correctness of the system. It allows only to detect errors which take place during the execution sequences used for the test.  
 In the last decade several theories have been developed which aim at coping with the problem of systems correctness by means of formal methodologies for the specification, design and verification of systems. These theories have been extended in order to deal with time, probability and stochastic aspects of behaviours.  
 Also real-time models where time is a dense quantity and verification can be done algorithmically (automatically) has been developed.  
 More recently, international standards for safety recommend the use of such methodologies, especially for critical systems.  
 Nevertheless, the use of formal methods in the industry is still quite limited. Apparently, major reasons for that are the notational difficulty of most formal methods available nowdays and the lack of integration between them. Notational complexity is often a deterrent to the use of formal methods stronger than the advantages of such methods. This is reinforced by the lack of models which support all the activities of system development:  
 requirements specification 
  validation of the specification 
  design 
  verification of the final product against the requirements 
  For each of the above activities different techniques have been developed independently. They are usually not at all integrated neither compatible and quite often they have been tried only on toy-examples, bringing to results which are rather difficult to compare. Finally, most of the automatic tools developed for supporting the use of formal methods lack of industrial strength and so turn out to be unpractical when used in the industrial context.  
  3.  Objectives   
 The main objectives of the WG are: To bring together scientists mainly of, but not only of institutions within ERCIM who are active in the field of formal methods and are willing to exchange their experience in the industrial usage of formal methods. 
  To coordinate efforts in the transfer of the formal methods technology and knowledge to the industry. 
  To promote research and development for the improvement of formal methods and tools with respect to their usage in the industry. 
  The above objectives will be met by means of: Workshops where the participation of industrial professionals will be solicited. 
  Development projects with industrial partners. 
  Research projects and researchers mobility.

 Select this result for bulk action   An agglomerative hierarchical clustering approach to identify coexisting bacteria in groups of bacterial vaginosis patients   
   
 Authors:  Hernández-Gómez, Henry Jesús  | Canul-Reich, Juana  | Hernández-Ocaña, Betania  | de la Cruz Hernández, Erick   
 Article Type:  Research Article  
 Abstract:  Polymicrobial syndromes such as Bacterial Vaginosis (BV), where there is a great diversity of microorganisms and causal connotations, turn it into a disease with complex dynamics in the bacteria’s coexistence in groups of patients. The main aim of this study was to explore a dataset of patients with BV to determine a more informed number of groups to create for further analysis of bacteria’s coexistence. The Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) algorithm was applied to a BV dataset from an urban population in southeastern Mexico consisting of 201 patient records with 59 patient attributes and three classes (BV-positive, BV-negative, BV-indeterminate). In  …  the clustering results obtained, it is possible to identify different remarkable groups of patients. The most prevalent coexisting bacteria among patients with BV were Atopobium + Gardnerella vaginalis with 37.50%, Atopobium + Megasphaera with 15.68% in the first experiment. Whereas, in the second experiment, the coexisting bacteria were Atopobium + Megasphaera + Mycoplasma hominis with 33.33% and Atopobium + Gardnerella vaginalis + Mycoplasma hominis with 25%. Finally, we provided evidence that via the AHC algorithm, it was possible to identify an optimal number of clusters with high intra-similarity and inter-dissimilarity. Furthermore, this approach allowed us to create a clustering model that helps analyze the complex dynamics between bacteria in groups of patients with BV.  Show more

 Select this result for bulk action   Active learning for ordinal classification on incomplete data   
   
 Authors:  He, Deniu   
 Article Type:  Research Article  
 Abstract:  Existing active learning algorithms typically assume that the data provided are complete. Nonetheless, data with missing values are common in real-world applications, and active learning on incomplete data is less studied. This paper studies the problem of active learning for ordinal classification on incomplete data. Although cutting-edge imputation methods can be used to impute the missing values before commencing active learning, inaccurately imputed instances are unavoidable and may degrade the ordinal classifier’s performance once labeled. Therefore, the crucial question in this work is how to reduce the negative impact of imprecisely filled instances on active learning. First, to avoid selecting  …  filled instances with high imputation imprecision, we propose penalizing the query selection with a novel imputation uncertainty measure that combines a feature-level imputation uncertainty and a knowledge-level imputation uncertainty. Second, to mitigate the adverse influence of potentially labeled imprecisely imputed instances, we suggest using a diversity-based uncertainty sampling strategy to select query instances in specified candidate instance regions. Extensive experiments on nine public ordinal classification datasets with varying value missing rates show that the proposed approach outperforms several baseline methods.  Show more

 Select this result for bulk action   Clustering-based improved adaptive synthetic minority oversampling technique for imbalanced data classification   
   
 Authors:  Jin, Dian  | Xie, Dehong  | Liu, Di  | Gong, Murong   
 Article Type:  Research Article  
 Abstract:  Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and some extensions based on it are popularly used to balance imbalanced data. In this study, we concentrate on solving overfitting of the classification model caused by choosing instances to oversample that increase the occurrence of overlaps with the majority class. Our method called Clustering-based Improved Adaptive Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (CI-ASMOTE1) decomposes minority instances into sub-clusters according to their connectivity in the feature space and then selects minority sub-clusters which are relatively close to the decision boundary as the candidate regions to oversample. After application of CI-ASMOTE1, new minority instances are only synthesized within  …  each connected region of the selected sub-clusters. Considering the diversity of the synthetic instances in each selected sub-cluster, CI-ASMOTE2 is put forward to extend CI-ASMOTE1 by keeping all features of those instances in the feature space as different as possible. The experimental evaluation shows that CI-ASMOTE1 and CI-ASMOTE2 improve SMOTE and its extensions, especially in the occurrence of overlaps between the minority instances and the majority instances.

 Select this result for bulk action   Local morphological patterns for time series classification   
   
 Authors:  Hao, Shilei  | Wang, Zhihai  | Yuan, Jidong   
 Article Type:  Research Article  
 Abstract:  The key problem of time series classification is the similarity measure between time series. In recent years, efficient and accurate similarity measurement methods of time series have attracted extensive attention from researchers. According to the different similarity measure strategies, the existing time series classification methods can be roughly divided into shape-based (original value) methods and structure-based (symbol transformation) methods. Shape-based methods usually use Euclidean distance (ED), dynamic time warping (DTW), or other methods to measure the global similarity between sequences. The disadvantage of these methods is that their measurement process does not necessarily achieve local sensible matchings of time series,  …  which leads to a decrease in their accuracy and interpretability. To better capture the local information of the sequence, the structure-based methods discretize or symbolize the local value of the time sequence, which leads to the loss of the original information of the sequence. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel similarity measurement method named dynamic time warping based on the local morphological pattern (MPDTW), which first decomposes the local subsequences of time series using discrete wavelet transforms for extracting the local structure information. Then, the decomposed subsequence will be encoded by the morphological pattern. Finally, the ED between points and their local structure difference based on morphological pattern will be weighted and applied to the DTW algorithm to measure the similarity between sequences. Experiments have been carried out on the classification tasks of the UCR datasets and the results show that our method outperforms the existing baselines.  Show more

 Select this result for bulk action   A prototype selection technique based on relative density and density peaks clustering for k nearest neighbor classification   
   
 Authors:  Xiang, Lina   
 Article Type:  Research Article  
 Abstract:  k -nearest neighbor classifier (KNN) is one of the most famous classification models due to its straightforward implementation and an error bounded by twice the Bayes error. However, it usually degrades because of noise and the high cost in computing the distance between different samples. In this context, hybrid prototype selection techniques have been postulated as a good solution and developed. Yet, they have the following issues: (a) adopted edition methods are susceptible to harmful samples around tested samples; (b) they retain too many internal samples, which contributes little to the classification of KNN classifier and (or) leading  …  to the low reduction; (c) they rely on many parameters. The main contributions of our work are that (a) a novel competitive hybrid prototype selection technique based on relative density and density peaks clustering (PST-RD-DP) are proposed against the above issues at the same time; (b) a new edition method based on relative density and distance (EMRDD) in PST-RD-DP is first proposed to remove harmful samples and smooth the class boundary; (c) a new condensing method based on relative density and density peaks clustering (CMRDDPC) in PST-RD-DP is second proposed to retain representative borderline samples. Intensive experiments prove that PST-RD-DP outperforms 6 popular hybrid prototype selection techniques on extensive real data sets in weighing accuracy and reduction of the KNN classifier. Besides, the running time of PST-RD-DP is also acceptable.  Show more

 Select this result for bulk action   Modeling multi-attribute and implicit relationship factors with self-supervised learning for recommender systems   
   
 Authors:  Hu, Linfeng  | Wen, Junhao  | Zhang, Hanwen  | Zhou, Wei  | Wang, Hongyu   
 Article Type:  Research Article  
 Abstract:  Interactions of users and items can be naturally modeled as a user-item bipartite graph in recommender systems, and emerging research is devoted to exploring user-item graphs for collaborative filtering methods. In reality, user-item interaction usually stems from more complex underlying factors, such as the users’ specific preferences. A user-item bipartite graph could be used to understand the differences in motivation. However, existing research has not clearly proposed and modeled the factors that affect the differences, ignoring the similarities between user pairs and item pairs, preventing them from capturing fine-grained user preferences more effectively. In addition to the two points mentioned  …  above, most GNN-based models for recommendation have the following two limitations: First, the model’s accuracy depends on the number of observed interactions in the dataset. Secondly, node representations are vulnerable to noisy interactions. This work has developed a novel recommendation model called “Multi-Attribute and Implicit Relationship Factors With Self-Supervised Learning for Collaborative filtering” (MIS-CF), which explicitly proposes and models multi-attribute and implicit relationship factors for collaborative filtering recommendation. Meanwhile, an auxiliary self-supervised learning task is designed to help the downstream task optimize the node representation. MIS-CF aggregates multi-attribute spaces through the user-item bipartite graph and establishes user-user and item-item graphs to model the similar relationship information of neighbor pairs through a memory model. The self-supervised learning task generates contrastive learning via self-discrimination, thus mining the rich auxiliary signals within the data, improving the accuracy and robustness of our model. Moreover, the sparse regularizer is utilized to alleviate the overfitting problem. Extensive experimental results on three public datasets not only show the significant performance and robustness gain of the proposed model but also prove the effectiveness and interpretability of fine-grained implicit factors modeling.

 Select this result for bulk action   Cross-community shortcut detection based on network representation learning and structural features   
   
 Authors:  Hu, Ruilin  | Du, Yajun  | Hu, Jingrong  | Li, Hui   
 Article Type:  Research Article  
 Abstract:  As social networks continue to expand, an increasing number of people prefer to use social networks to post their comments and express their feelings, and as a result, the information contained in social networks has grown explosively. The effective extraction of valuable information from social networks has attracted the attention of many researchers. It can mine hidden information from social networks and promote the development of social network structures. At present, many ranking node approaches, such as structural hole spanners and opinion leaders, are widely adopted to extract valuable information and knowledge. However, approaches for analyzing edge influences are seldom  …  considered. In this study, we proposed an edge PageRank to mine shortcuts (these edges without direct mutual friends) that are located among communities and play an important role in the spread of public opinion. We first used a network-embedding algorithm to order the spanners and determine the direction of every edge. Then, we transferred the graphs of social networks into edge graphs according to the ordering. We considered the nodes and edges of the graphs of the social networks as edges and nodes of the edge graphs, respectively. Finally, we improved the PageRank algorithm on the edge graph to obtained the edge ranking and extracted the shortcuts of social networks. The experimental results for five different sizes of social networks, such as email, YouTube, DBLP-L, DBLP-M, and DBLP-S, verify whether the inferred shortcut is indeed more useful for information dissemination, and the utility of three sets of edges inferred by different methods is compared, namely, the edge inferred by ER, the edge inferred by the Jaccard index. The ER approach improves by approximately 10%, 9.9%, and 8.3% on DBLP, YouTube, and Orkut. Our method is more effective than the edge ranked by the Jaccard index.  Show more

 Select this result for bulk action   Attribute-guided and attribute-manipulated similarity learning network for fashion image retrieval   
   
 Authors:  Wan, Yongquan  | Yan, Cairong  | Zou, Guobing  | Zhang, Bofeng   
 Article Type:  Research Article  
 Abstract:  Learning the similarity between fashion items is essential for many fashion-related tasks. Most methods based on global or local image similarity cannot meet the fine-grained retrieval requirements related to attributes. We are the first to clearly distinguish the concepts of attribute name and their values and divide fashion retrieval tasks that combine images and text into: attribute-guided retrieval and attribute-manipulated retrieval. We propose a hierarchical attribute-aware embedding network (HAEN) that takes images and attributes as input, learns multiple attribute-specific embedding spaces, and measures fine-grained similarity in the corresponding spaces. It can accurately map different attributes to the corresponding areas of  …  the image, thereby facilitating the feature fusion of two different modalities of text and image, including enhancement and replacement. Then on this basis, we propose three attribute-manipulated similarity learning methods, HAEN_Avg, HAEN_Rec, and HAEN_Cmb. With comprehensive validation on two real-world fashion datasets, we demonstrate that our methods can effectively leverage semantic knowledge to improve image retrieval performance, including attribute-guided and attribute-manipulated retrieval tasks.

 Select this result for bulk action   A novel framework to enhance the performance of training distributed deep neural networks   
   
 Authors:  Phan, Trung  | Do, Phuc   
 Article Type:  Research Article  
 Abstract:  There are many attempts to implement deep neural network (DNN) distributed training frameworks. In these attempts, Apache Spark was used to develop the frameworks. Each framework has its advantages and disadvantages and needs further improvements. In the process of using Apache Spark to implement distributed training systems, we ran into some obstacles that significantly affect the performance of the systems and programming thinking. This is the reason why we developed our own distributed training framework, called Distributed Deep Learning Framework (DDLF), which is completely independent of Apache Spark. Our proposed framework can overcome the obstacles and is highly scalable. DDLF  …  helps to develop applications that train DNN in a distributed environment (referred to as distributed training) in a simple, natural, and flexible way. In this paper, we will analyze the obstacles when implementing a distributed training system on Apache Spark and present solutions to overcome them in DDLF. We also present the features of DDLF and how to implement a distributed DNN training application on this framework. In addition, we conduct experiments by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with datasets MNIST and CIFAR-10 in Apache Spark cluster and DDLF cluster to demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of DDLF.

 In this issue:   
 iEMSs 2026 at University College Dublin (UCD) in Dublin, Ireland 
  iEMSs 2024 at Michigan State University in East Lansing, USA 
  #OSIRIS Survey on Computational Reproducibility 
  iEMSs 2026 in University College Dublin (UCD)  Dublin, Ireland   
   We are delighted to announce that the 13 th  iEMSs conference will be convened by David Ayala-Cabrera and Soumyabrata Dev at University College Dublin (UCD), Ireland.  
  
 Dr David Ayala-Cabrera is an Assistant Professor at UCD, with a focus on civil engineering and environmental modelling. His research is dedicated to advancing sustainable infrastructure and improving water resource management. | Dr Soumyabrata Dev is an Assistant Professor at UCD, specialising in machine learning, computer vision, and remote sensing. His work is at the forefront of applying artificial intelligence to address pressing global challenges, including climate change and environmental monitoring. 
  
  UCD is Ireland’s largest university, blending over 160 years of history with modern facilities. The conference venue will be O’Reilly Hall within the main campus within Dublin City. Dublin is well connected to direct routes from Europe and North America and the city is well-served by public transportation. The conference location will offer a good range of accommodation options ranging from university halls to near-by hotels.  
 We anticipate that Dublin and Ireland will be an attractive destination for Society members. The Irish are world renowned for their hospitality and Dublin is a city of contrasts, blending historic charm with modern sophistication.  
 Conference dates are yet to be confirmed (our preferred dates are waitlisted) but will be in late June or July. Please look out for an announcement soon!  
 We look forward to seeing you in Dublin!  

 iEMSs 2024 at Michigan State University in East Lansing, USA   
 From 23 to 27 June 2024, we gathered on the Michigan State University  (MSU) campus in East Lansing to hold our 12 th  biennial conference with the overarching motto “Addressing Global Environmental Challenges Through Intelligent Modelling”  . Our MSU colleagues had set up a great event with short connections between the meeting rooms and accommodation, and we were delighted to welcome more than 180 participants from 21 countries. On Sunday evening, we gathered for early registration and an icebreaker reception in the lovely outdoor grounds of the Kellogg Centre, and on Monday morning, we formally opened the conference with welcoming words from the MSU President and the Director of AgBioResearch  , followed by a very engaging keynote presentation by Whitney Gravelle  , President and member of the Executive Council of the Bay Mills Indian Community. Whitney focused on the most pressing environmental topics in Michigan and beyond from the perspective of an Indigenous community and the role that environmental science and modelling can play in finding solutions to these challenges.  
 Following a busy day of parallel sessions and workshops, we gathered for an opening reception. For the plenary session on Tuesday, we welcomed Barbara Robson  , Leader of the Tropical Marine Water Quality and Impacts team at the Australian Institute of Marine Science, talking about ‘Assessing model “fitness for purpose” in the context of long-term change’. After a further set of parallel sessions and workshops, the iEMSs committee on Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion met, and conference participants had the opportunity to meet the editors of SESMO  and Environmental Modelling & Software  to ask questions or discuss particular topics.  
 Our Wednesday was opened by another excellent keynote speaker, Mariana Rufino  , Chair of Livestock Systems at the Technical University of Munich, Germany. She elaborated on the topic of “Smart Grazing: digital tech and models to improve the sustainability of livestock” and gave us her insights into the role of environmental software and modelling in agriculture, with a wider view of current challenges. After more sessions and workshops, we all gathered at the MSU Football Stadium, home of the Spartans, for our banquet and used this occasion to honor our awardees of Fellowships, Early Career Research Excellence prizes and the Biennial Medals  , which had been selected as usual in the odd year (Fellowships) and earlier in 2024 (ECREs and Medals). Here, we also announced that iEMSs 2026 will tentatively be held in Dublin, Ireland, with details yet to be finalized.  
 Our final day, Thursday, started without a plenary session, and after several more parallel sessions and workshops, we gathered for a joint lunch and presented the awards for the best student presentations  before closing the 2024 iEMSs biennial conference.

 SPRING 2024 NEWSLETTER   
 March 14, 2024   
   
 In this issue:   
 iEMSs 2024 Call for Abstracts – Deadline 19 April 2024 
  iEMSs Registration Reminder 
  iEMSs Elections 
  iEMSs 2024 Biennial Conference –   
 Abstract submissions extended to 19 April 2024   
   Call for Abstracts for iEMSs 2024  , abstracts are currently being accepted. Deadline for submission has been extended to 19 April 2024! Submit Abstracts here:  
  https://proceedings.iemss.org/index.php/2024/about/submissions   
 Session convenors: please assess all abstracts as they are submitted.  
 To enable travel decisions based on an accepted submission, please consider submitting your abstracts as soon as possible.  
 As a quick reminder and background: the iEMSs Board and Office have decided to move to a model with extended abstracts (max. 2 pages including references)  only. This is because there is substantial additional effort required to manage the review process and to ensure that conference proceedings were edited and made available online open access in an acceptable amount of time. Download figures for full conference papers, and the major hurdles of getting proceedings and full papers of a comparatively smaller conference indexed in Web of Science or Scopus did not justify that effort. In addition, we are publishing SESMO  , our full open access journal, and edit Environmental Modelling and Software  , which provide excellent outlets for full manuscripts which may emerge from iEMSs biennial conferences. Specific communications around opportunities for special issues and general submissions to both journals in the context of iEMSs 2024 as an excellent venue for publishing full manuscripts will be made in due course.  
 We will gather feedback after the 2024 conference and report back to the new Office and Board to be elected next year to review this approach in time for the 2026 conference and beyond.  
 Secondly, after working with several different conference management and abstract handling systems over the years, we have decided to invest some efforts in setting up the Open Journal System (OJS), which is used as well to publish SESMO. Along with setting up a persistent conference website as part of the iEMSs domain, the plan is to trial OJS for the 2024 conference, gather feedback and learning points, and if all goes well, we will go with this setup for all future conferences. This will have several benefits, including the ease of generating open access proceedings directly in the iEMSs online presence and close to, if not even before the actual conference. In addition, it would give abstract authors, session organisers and stream convenors the same user experience every time, without the need to adapt to a new system again and again.  
 We will be working with session organisers and stream convenors as we run this new setup for a first time in the run up to June. We may hit a bump or two and experience some hiccups, but the potential advantages operating our own setup will streamline our conference organization in the future and benefit local organisers and scientific committees going forward.

 iEMSs 2024 Biennial Conference Updates – Call for Abstracts 
  Conference IAMES 2024 Savona, Italy 
  iEMSs 2024 Biennial Conference – Call for Abstracts   
   We are delighted to open the Call for Abstracts for iEMSs 2024  , which you can find here:  
  https://proceedings.iemss.org/index.php/2024/about/submissions   
 The final deadline for abstract submission is 5 April 2024, which will give you all ample time to prepare and submit your abstracts. However, we ask the session convenors to assess all abstracts as they are submitted and to enable you to make travel decisions based on an accepted submission, please consider submitting your abstracts as soon as possible.  
 As a quick reminder and background: the iEMSs Board and Office have decided to move to a model with extended abstracts (max. 2 pages including references)  only. The main reason for this has been the substantial additional effort required to manage the review process and to ensure that conference proceedings were edited and made available online open access in an acceptable amount of time. Download figures for full conference papers, and the major hurdles of getting proceedings and full papers of a comparatively smaller conference indexed in Web of Science or Scopus did not justify that effort. In addition, we are publishing SESMO  , our full open access journal, and edit Environmental Modelling and Software  , which provide excellent outlets for full manuscripts which may emerge from iEMSs biennial conferences. Specific communications around opportunities for special issues and general submissions to both journals in the context of iEMSs 2024 as an excellent venue for publishing full manuscripts will be made in due course.  
 We will gather feedback after the 2024 conference and report back to the new Office and Board to be elected next year to review this approach in time for the 2026 conference and beyond.  
 Secondly, after working with several different conference management and abstract handling systems over the years, we have decided to invest some efforts in setting up the Open Journal System (OJS), which is used as well to publish SESMO. Along with setting up a persistent conference website as part of the iEMSs domain, the plan is to trial OJS for the 2024 conference, gather feedback and learning points, and if all goes well, we will go with this setup for all future conferences. This will have several benefits, including the ease of generating open access proceedings directly in the iEMSs online presence and close to, if not even before the actual conference. In addition, it would give abstract authors, session organisers and stream convenors the same user experience every time, without the need to adapt to a new system again and again.  
 We will be working with session organisers and stream convenors as we run this new setup for a first time in the run up to June. We may hit a bump or two and experience some hiccups, but the potential advantages operating our own setup will streamline our conference organization in the future and benefit local organisers and scientific committees going forward.

 CALL FOR PAPERS   
 IVA 2023: ACM Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents  
  Special topic: IVAs in future mixed realities”  
   September 19-22, 2023  
  Würzburg, German  
  https://iva.acm.org/2023/   
 Abstract submission: April 14, 2023  
  Paper submission: April 18, 2023  
 The annual ACM Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA) is the premier international event for interdisciplinary research on the development, application, and evaluation of Intelligent Virtual Agents with a focus on the ability for social interaction, communication or cooperation. Such artificial agents can be embodied graphically (e.g. virtual characters, embodied conversational agents) or physically (e.g. social or collaborative robots). They are capable of real-time perception, cognition, emotion and action allowing them to participate in dynamic social environments. This includes human-like interaction qualities such as multimodal communication using facial expressions, speech, and gesture, conversational interaction, socially assistive and affective interaction, interactive task-oriented cooperation, or social behaviour simulation. IVAs are highly relevant and widely applied in many important domains including health, tutoring, training, games, or assisted living.  
 We invite submissions of research on a broad range of topics, including but not limited to: theoretical foundations of intelligent virtual agents, agent and interactive behaviour modelling, evaluation, agents in simulations, games, and other applications. Please see the detailed list of topics below.   
 VENUE  
 IVA 2023 will take place in Würzburg, Germany. Würzburg is a vibrant town located by the river Main in northern Bavaria, between Frankfurt and Nuremberg. The mix of stunning historical architecture and the young population is what makes the atmosphere so unique, including 35,000 students from three different universities. The mild and sunny climate is ideal to enjoy the many activities Würzburg has to offer: visiting a beer garden next to the river, attending a sporting or cultural event or taking a stroll through one of the parks.  
 IVA is targeted to be an in-person conference. In case of extraordinary circumstances, such as visa problems or health issues, video presentation will be possible. However, there is no digital or hybrid conference system planned, thus it is not possible to attend this year’s IVA conference remotely.  
 IMPORTANT DATES  
 Abstract submission: April 14, 2023  
  Paper submission: April 18, 2023  
  Review notification / start of rebuttal: May 31, 2023  
  Notification of acceptance: June 23, 2023  
  Camera ready deadline: July 18, 2023  
  Conference: September 19-22, 2023  
 All deadlines are anywhere on earth ( UTC−12).  
 SPECIAL TOPIC  
 This year’s conference will highlight a special topic on “IVAs in future mixed realities”, e.g., in social VR and potential incarnations of a Metaverse. Immersive and potentially distributed artificial virtual worlds provide new forms of full-size embodied human-human interaction via avatars of arbitrary looks, enabling interesting intra- and interpersonal effects. They also enable hybrid avatar-agent interactions between humans and A.I.s, unlocking the full potential of non-verbal behavior in digital face-to-face encounters, significantly enhancing the design space for IVAs to assist, guide, help but also to persuade and affect interacting users. We specifically welcome all kinds of novel research on technological, psychological, and sociological determinants of such immersive digital avatar-agent encounters.  
 TYPES OF SUBMISSION  
 Full Papers (7 pages + 1 additional page for references): | Full papers should present significant, novel, and substantial work of high quality. 
  Extended Abstracts (2 pages + 1 additional page for references) | Extended abstracts may contain early results and work in progress. 
  Demos (2 pages + 1 additional page for references +1 one page with demo requirements) | Demos submissions focus on implemented systems and should contain a link to a video of the system with a maximum length of 5 minutes. 
  All submissions will be double-blind peer-reviewed by a group of external expert reviewers. All accepted submissions will be published in the ACM proceedings.  
 Accepted full papers will be presented either in oral sessions or as posters during the conference (depending on the nature of the contribution), extended abstracts will be presented as posters, and demos will be showcased in dedicated sessions during the conference. For each accepted contribution, at least one of the authors must register for the conference.  
 IVA 2023 will also feature workshops and a doctoral consortium. Please visit the website ( https://iva.acm.org/2023  ) for more details and updates.

 IDC '23   
 June 19-23, 2023  

 Welcome to IDC’23  
  
 We are pleased to announce the 22nd annual ACM Interaction Design and Children (IDC) Conference  to be held on June 19-23, 2023  at Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois. IDC is the premier international conference for researchers, educators and practitioners to share the latest research findings, innovative methodologies and new technologies in the areas of inclusive child-centered design, learning and interaction. IDC’23 is hosted by the Center for Computer Science and Learning Sciences at Northwestern University.

 As we emerge from two years of global pandemic, we are reconnecting in a world where technology plays an unprecedented role in the everyday lives of children, from education and learning, to entertainment and play, to health, development and well-being. The theme for Interaction Design and Children 2023 asks us to “rediscover childhood” after the pandemic as we (re)emerge, (re)engage, and (re)connect with one another. The theme confronts us with questions about what it means to be a child or adolescent in the middle decades of the 21st century, and what adults can do to ensure a sustainable and equitable future for the next generation. IDC is interested in many forms of digital interaction including tangible, virtual, mobile, and mixed reality. We encourage submissions that anticipate concerns of privacy, ethics, equity, social and emotional wellbeing, sustainability, and healthy human development. And, as always, we encourage submissions that reflect on the nuances of design work for and with children.  
 While all submissions related to Interaction Design and Children (IDC) are welcome to the conference (see the list of tracks and general topics below), the theme for the conference is an opportunity for the IDC community to take a reflective and generative outlook on children’s technology.  
    
 Submissions to all tracks are invited on the following topics:  
 Areas of Interest  
 • Designing the future of technology for and with children  
  • Designing for sustainability (environmental, institutional, developmental etc)  
  • Equity, diversity, inclusion, and social justice as it relates to the lives of children  
  • Innovative interactive technology for children and its implications  
  • Theoretically motivated arguments regarding interaction design and children  
  • Empirical studies concerned with the interaction of children and technology  
  • Methods and techniques supporting interaction design for/with children  
  • Studies of the effects of technology on children’s lives and development  
  • Reflective analyses on the field of child computer interaction and interaction design  
  • Constructive design research for and with children  
  • Studies discussing the involvement of children in the design process  
  • Ethics in approaching children-computer interaction research  
  • Future vision articles, discussing trends and directions for the field

 Events  Rediscovering Childhood at the ACM Interaction Design and Children Conference  
 Professor Michael Horn served as general chair of the five-day conference  

 Jul 18, 2023  Michelle Mohney   
 Children and adolescents are growing up with technology front and center in their everyday lives — from education and learning to entertainment and play to health, development, and well-being.  
 Exploring the theme of reemergence, reengagement, and reconnection after two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 22nd annual ACM Interaction Design and Children (IDC ’23) Conference  brought together researchers, educators, and practitioners to “rediscover childhood” and question what adults can do to ensure a sustainable and equitable future for the next generation.  
 Hosted last month by Northwestern’s Center for Computer Science and Learning Sciences  , a collaboration between Northwestern Engineering and Northwestern’s School of Education and Social Policy  (SESP), IDC ’23 is the premier international conference showcasing the latest research findings, innovative methodologies, and new technologies in the areas of inclusive child-centered design, learning, and interaction.  
  Michael Horn  , professor of computer science at the McCormick School of Engineering and a professor of learning sciences at SESP, served as the general chair of IDC ’23.  
 Horn codirects the Center for Computer Science and Learning Sciences with Chris Riesbeck  , associate professor of computer science at Northwestern Engineering, and Uri Wilensky  , the Lorraine Morton Professor of Learning Sciences and Computer Science.  
 “Hosting IDC in Chicago was an ideal opportunity to highlight the work of the center in research and graduate student education,” said Horn, who also directs the Tangible Interaction Design and Learning (TIDAL) Laboratory  , a team of designers, artists, learning scientists, and computer scientists aiming to study and create innovative technology-based learning experiences.  
 Program highlights  
 The five-day conference focused on children’s technology across many forms of digital interaction, including tangible, virtual, mobile, and mixed reality. Horn and the organizing committee  — composed of 65 members representing 37 academic and industry institutions in 14 countries — encouraged submissions that reflected on the nuances of design work for and with children and anticipate concerns of privacy, ethics, equity, social and emotional wellbeing, sustainability, and healthy human development.  
 The technical program  represented the breadth of the field and included 31 full papers, four short papers, and one pictorial from 125 submissions. Sessions were organized into the themes of augmented and virtual reality, computational and data literacy, child safety and wellbeing, conversational agents and natural language processing, robotics, co-design, and multisensory learning.  
 In the “STEAM Tools for Learning” session, Horn, Wilensky, John Chen  , a computer sciences and learning sciences (CS+LS) PhD student, and Lexie Zhao, a PhD student in learning sciences at SESP, presented a paper on the design of a scaffolded agent-based programming space called the Pocketworld Playground. The team demonstrated their success in engaging young, out-of-school online learners in computational and complex systems thinking.  
 The IDC ’23 program also included keynote lectures by Heather Kirkorian, Laura M. Secord Chair in Early Childhood Development and professor of human development and family studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Jackie Miller, principal and chief academic officer at Bennett Day School in Chicago’s West Loop neighborhood.  
 In addition, the conference featured a panel discussion with educators from Bennett Day School, 47 work-in-progress poster presentations, 13 demo and art presentations, 11 presentations in the doctoral consortium — a forum for PhD students to present their work and receive feedback and guidance by experienced researchers in the field — and five workshops.

 Workshop for makers  
  Marcelo Worsley  , assistant professor of computer science at Northwestern Engineering and assistant professor of learning sciences at SESP, co-organized the “ For Maker’s Sake: A Somatic Exploration of Making  ” workshop with Meg Butler  , a PhD student in learning sciences, Stephanie T. Jones  , a PhD student in CS+LS, Sarah Priscilla Lee  , a PhD student in learning sciences; Zoe Lewis  , an undergraduate student studying learning sciences, entrepreneurship, and Spanish at Northwestern; and Tyler Nanoff  (’23), a PhD student in mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan.  
 The half-day workshop centered around the making practices and experiences of a small group of practitioners, researchers, educators, and students. While creating artifacts with a laser cutter, workshop participants identified and discussed considerations and practices related to making as a form of personal expression.  
 Worsley directs the Technological Innovations for Inclusive Learning and Teaching (TIILT) Lab  , which aims to develop educational and technological solutions for supporting inclusive learning among underserved populations in hands-on, collaborative environments.  
 Learning, Design, and Technology Symposium  
 The IDC ’23 conference concluded with the inaugural Learning, Design and Technology Symposium  , hosted by Northwestern’s Center for Human-Computer Interaction + Design  , a collaboration between Northwestern Engineering and Northwestern’s School of Communication  .  
 The symposium organizers, including Horn and Duri Long  , assistant professor of communication studies at Northwestern’s School of Communication and (by courtesy) of computer science at Northwestern Engineering, aim to build a research community and forum around the intersection of topics in interaction design, technologies, and learning, such as human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, participatory design, learning sciences, learning analytics, educational psychology, educational data, and digital literacy.  
 Research presented at the symposium addressed the design, development, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computer systems to support and amplify human learning and cognition and the wider impact of learning and technology on society.  
 Horn and Cameron Roberts  (’20), a software engineer with the TIDAL Lab who earned a bachelor’s degree in computer science from Northwestern’s Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences  and a bachelor of music in saxophone performance from Northwestern’s Bienen School of Music  , presented a paper  on the integration of computer programming and music-making. In the study, five undergraduate students with experience in both music and coding completed two creative musical tasks.  
 Wilensky, Bruce Sherin  , professor of learning sciences at SESP, and a team from Utah State University discussed their paper  on co-designing a computational modeling lesson with an eighth-grade science teacher. The team reported on the outcomes of the responsive teaching strategies and how the co-designed technology supported the educator in eliciting and responding to student ideas.  
 Demonstrations and art presentations  
 Demonstrations and art installations at IDC ’23, including prototypes, devices, systems, games, videos, and performances, provided hands-on experiences to promote and provoke debate around interactive technologies for children. This year, due to increasing interest from youth, young people in local schools, libraries, and makerspace programs were invited to submit digital artwork or interactive systems alongside practitioners in areas such as design, learning, engineering, research, and fine arts.  
 “The demos and arts track is one of the best parts of IDC,” Horn said. “It’s fantastic to see the full range of creativity in the community on display at the conference. I was especially excited to have high school students join us from across the country to share their work.”

 The 25th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility  
 The ASSETS conference is the premier forum for presenting research on the design, evaluation use, and education related to computing for people with disabilities and older adults. For those in Europe and Oceania, ASSETS is rated as Core A —a designation for the top academic conferences that are "highly respected in a discipline area" ( Core A  ; Top 16%).  
 We invite high-quality original submissions on topics relevant to computing and accessibility. All contributions are peer-reviewed by an international Program Committee. Accepted papers and the abstracts for posters and demonstrations, experience reports, and the student research competition will be archived in the ACM Digital Library. Authors of selected papers will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers to a special issue of the ACM Transactions on Accessible Computing (TACCESS).   
 *The in-person full conference events will take place from October 23 to October 25. However, invitation-only events (i.e. the Doctoral Consortium) will take place on October 22.

66. ASSETS_1 conference:
Registration  
 October 23 - 25, 2023  

 On This Page  

 Early registration is closed, but regular registration is open! Register before October 4th for the ASSETS'23 conference on the CVENT Registration Site  . We can't wait to have you join us at ASSETS’23!  

 Registration Overview  
 Registrations for conferences can be complicated, reflecting an array of options and time-contingent fee structures. ASSETS is no different. Allow us to help make sense of things. We have:  
 Four registration types: | (1) ACM member, (2) non-member, (3) student ACM member, | and | (4) student non-member. | If you are not yet an ACM member, it often makes financial sense to become one. See | ACM's membership options here | . 
  Three registration deadlines | that affect pricing: | (1) early, (2) regular, (3) late. | Generally it's best to register early to save costs and to help us plan events. 
  Two conference experiences: | (1) the | in-person conference | in New York City or (2) a (very) lighterweight, | asynchronous virtual option | for those that cannot travel due to personal preference or scheduling. See the | Attending Overview page | for details. 
  Below, we expand on each option and provide pricing.  

 In-Person Conference  
 ASSETS'23 is planned primarily as an in-person event with an asynchronous option for individuals to view pre-recorded videos and engage in discussion on Discord. Please see the Attending Overview  page for details.  
 This hybrid model was used at ASSETS’22 in Athens, Greece  . the in-person conference experience will be similar to previous in-person ASSETS conferences such as ASSETS'18 in Galway, Ireland  or ASSETS'19 in Pittsburgh, PA  .  
 There will be in-person talks, poster and demo sessions 
  Additional details about the virtual portion of the conference will be posted soon. 
  More details will be shared as the day of the conference gets closer. 
   
 At least one author of accepted technical papers, posters and demonstrations, or other artifact-based tracks is expected to travel to New York City to present their work. If traveling to ASSETS is inaccessible to you or presents an insurmountable COVID health/safety risk for you, please email General Chair  , and we can find ways to accommodate you.  
  
 Delegate Type | Early Registration (08/25) | Regular Registration (10/04) | Late Registration 
 ACM/SIG Member | $675.00 | $855.00 | $1020.00 
 Non-Member | $825.00 | $1020.00 | $1130.00 
 Student Member | $545.00 | $605.00 | $655.00 
 Student Non-Member | $660.00 | $715.00 | $770.00 
  
 Cancellation policy: if you cancel your in-person conference registration by Sept 5th, we will provide a 50% refund. All in-person registrants also get access to virtual content. If you test positive for COVID before the conference that prevents travel, you can use our virtual option; however, we will not provide a reimbursement for the cost difference.   

 Virtual Option  
 ASSETS'23 will offer a lightweight virtual option for those authors and attendees that cannot travel to New York due to COVID health or accessibility concerns. More details will be provided soon as the conference day gets closer.  
  
 Delegate Type | Early Registration (08/25) | Regular Registration (10/04) | Late Registration 
 ACM/SIG Member | $100.00 | $130.00 | $155.00 
 Non-Member | $130.00 | $155.00 | $175.00 
 Student Member | $55.00 | $65.00 | $75.00 
 Student Non-Member | $75.00 | $100.00 | $120.00 
  
 Cancellation policy: we will not provide refunds for virtual conference registrations.   

 Virtual Workshops  
 This year, there are four accepted workshops. See listing on the Accepted Workshops page  .  
 You must apply to participate in a workshop. Each workshop is being run independently by the respective co-organizers along with support from the ASSETS'23 Workshop Co-chairs, Julian Brinkley and Earl Huff Jr. If you are accepted into a workshop, you must register for the workshop track. We hope you will also choose to register for the conference but this is not required. Please email workshops-assets23@acm.org  with questions or concerns.  
  
 ACM/SIG Member | Non-Member | Student Member | Student Non-Member 
 Cost | $50.00 | $60.00 | $40.00 | $50.00 
  
 Cancellation policy: we will not refund virtual workshop fees. Registration for the virtual workshop will open in October.

  Selected Papers from the Thirteenth International Baltic Conference, DB&IS 2018   
 The importance of databases and information systems to the functioning of 21st century life is indisputable.  
 This book presents papers from the 13th International Baltic Conference on Databases and Information Systems, held in Trakai, Lithuania, from 1- 4 July 2018. Since the first of these events in 1994, the Baltic DB&IS has proved itself to be an excellent forum for researchers, practitioners and PhD students to deliver and share their research in the field of advanced information systems, databases and related areas.  
 For the 2018 conference, 69 submissions were received from 15 countries. Each paper was assigned for review to at least three referees from different countries. Following review, 24 regular papers were accepted for presentation at the conference, and from these presented papers the 14 best-revised papers have been selected for publication in this volume, together with a preface and three invited papers written by leading experts. The selected revised and extended papers present original research results in a number of subject areas: information systems, requirements and ontology engineering; advanced database systems; internet of things; big data analysis; cognitive computing; and applications and case studies.  
 These results will contribute to the further development of this fast-growing field, and will be of interest to all those working with advanced information systems, databases and related areas.

 EATCS International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP)  
 ICALP joined SafeToC http://safetoc.org/  (code of conduct here  )  
 The International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP) is the flagship conference and annual meeting of the EATCS. The conference was launched in 1972 and covers all aspects of theoretical computer science. ICALP customarily takes place during the second or third week of July.  
 ICALP’s scientific program is split into two parts: Track A of the meeting corresponds to Algorithms, Complexity, and Games, and Track B to Automata, Logic, Semantics, and Theory of Programming. Typical topics are: algorithmic aspects of network economics, approximation and online algorithms, automata theory, combinatorial optimisation, computational complexity, design and analysis of algorithms, formal aspects of security, foundations of databases, games and logic, logic and semantics of programs, mathematical aspects of programming, models of concurrent, reactive and stochastic systems, networked computation, parallel and distributed computing, quantum computing, randomness in computing, type systems, verification and synthesis.  
 EATCS presents annually the Best EATCS Paper Award  , the Best Student  and best ICALP Paper  Awards, all awarded at ICALP. Jointly with ACM SIGLOG, EACSL and the Kurt Goedel Society, EATCS presents the Alonzo Church award. Jointly with ACM SIGACT, EATCS awards the Gödel Prize for outstanding papers in the area of theoretical computer science. The award ceremony takes place alternately at ICALP and STOC.  
 The proceedings of ICALP are published since 2015 in the open-access series Schloss Dagstuhl - Leibniz-Zentrum für Informatik (LIPIcs) and are available at https://dblp.org/db/conf/icalp/index.html  .

 About ICTAC  
 The International Colloquium on Theoretical Aspects of Computing ( ICTAC  ) was founded in 2004. It takes place every year preferably in a developing country. The aim of the colloquium is to bring together practitioners and researchers from academia, industry and government to present research results, and exchange experience, ideas, and solutions for their problems in theoretical aspects of computing. Beyond these scholarly goals, another main purpose of the conference is to promote cooperation in research and education between participants and their institutions, from developing and industrial countries.

 Submission (tracks A and B): EasyChair ICALP 2023  
  
 Invited Speakers   
 Anna Karlin - University of Washington, USA  
 Rasmus Kyng - ETH Zurich, Switzerland  
 Rupak Majumdar - Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, Germany  
 Thomas Vidick - California Institute of Technology, USA, and Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel  
 James Worrell - University of Oxford, UK  
  
 Submission guidelines   
 Papers must present original research on the theory of computer science. No prior publication and no simultaneous submission to other publication outlets (either a conference or a journal) is allowed. Authors are encouraged to also make full versions of their submissions freely accessible in an on-line repository such as ArXiv, HAL, ECCC.  
 Submissions take the form of an extended abstract of no more than 15 pages, excluding references and a clearly labelled appendix. The appendix may consist either of omitted proofs or of a full version of the submission, and it will be read at the discretion of program committee members. The extended abstract has to present the merits of the paper and its main contributions clearly, and describe the key concepts and technical ideas used to obtain the results. Submissions must provide the proofs which can enable the main mathematical claims of the paper to be fully verified.  
 Submissions are anonymous. The conference will employ a fairly lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work are in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”).  
  
 The purpose of this double-blind process is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, and not to make it impossible for them to discover who the authors are if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas.  
 The submissions are done via Easychair to the appropriate track of the conference (see topics below). The use of pdflatex and the LIPIcs style are mandatory: papers that deviate significantly from the required format risk rejection without consideration of merit.  
 During the rebuttal phase, authors will have from March 22-25 to view and respond to initial reviews. Further instructions will be sent to authors of submitted papers before that time.  
 At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for the conference, and all talks are in-person. In exceptional cases, there may be support for remotely presenting a talk.  
 Papers authored only by students should be marked as such upon submission in order to be eligible for the best student paper awards of the track.  
  
 Awards   
 During the conference, the following awards will be given:  
  
 the EATCS award  
 the Church prize  
 the Presburger award  
 the EATCS distinguished dissertation award  
 the best papers for Track A and Track B  
 the best student papers for Track A and Track B (see submission guidelines)  
  
 Proceedings   
 ICALP proceedings are published in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series. This is a series of high-quality conference proceedings across all fields in informatics established in cooperation with Schloss Dagstuhl – Leibniz Center for Informatics. LIPIcs volumes are published according to the principle of Open Access, i.e., they are available online and free of charge.

  How customer reviews and ratings work   Customer Reviews, including Product Star Ratings, help customers to learn more about the product and decide whether it is the right product for them.  
 To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyses reviews to verify trustworthiness.

 Thalia Sirjue  
 Chief of Staff  
  New Jersey Department of Health  
 Thalia Sirjue is a diehard public health nerd, passionate about using technology to engage people in improving their own health. She currently gets her fill of public health nerdiness by serving as Chief of Staff at the New Jersey Department of Health where she oversees more than 5,600 employees and a combined State/Federal budget of $2.8 billion and. In this role, she acts as a Chief Operating Officer, overseeing the foundational units of the Department – Human Resources, Fiscal/Management & Administration, Health Information Technology, Healthcare Quality and Informatics, Communications, Policy & Legislative Affairs, Ethics, EEO/AA and Equity Services, and Research Initiatives. She also leads enterprise-wide initiatives for strategic planning, public health accreditation, and health innovation.  
 Thalia previously served as the Deputy Chief of Staff responsible for a myriad of special projects.

 Thalia earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology from Boston University and Master of Public Health degree from the Milken Institute School of Public Health at the George Washington University. Thalia is a Jersey girl to her core. This mixed with her Jamaican and Cuban heritage means she drives fast, will eat a bacon or pork roll, egg, and cheese for any meal of the day, and lives for sun, sand, and saltwater. If she has free time, she spends it cooking, baking, reading romance novels and murder mysteries, watching anime, and going on walks with her husband and daughter.

 Gen. Paul M. Nakasone  
 Former Commander, U.S. Cyber Command & Former Director  
 A name synonymous with visionary leadership, retired four-star Army General Paul M. Nakasone is the longest-serving leader of the U.S. Cyber Command and the National Security Agency/Central Security Service, and is regarded among an elite class of leaders whose strategic expertise at the nexus of cybersecurity, technology, and geopolitics has laid the groundwork for upholding our nation’s security in the modern age. General Nakasone’s career spans more than three decades of pivotal moments in modern warfare and digital defense and he draws upon his experiences constantly at the epicenter of conflict to share battle-tested lessons on transformational leadership, while also examining the challenges and opportunities organizations face in the ever-evolving tech and security landscape. Exclusively represented by Leading Authorities speakers bureau, Nakasone is an engaging and dynamic speaker who leads audiences on a fascinating exploration into how our experiences today, paired with the advent of rapid and constant technological change, will shape the future — and what that means for how we approach the safety and security of our systems and society. Pointing to strategies that consistently led him and his teams to mission success in his own career, Nakasone shares recent examples of complex situations in which innovative ideas provided the catalyst for successful outcomes. As part of his talks, Nakasone emphasizes the skills that need to be sharpened in order to make a transformational impact as a leader, as well as the importance of purposefully recruiting, training, and retaining talent. He is of the belief that, ultimately, what shapes our future is fully dependent on the manner in which organizations invest leadership and talent. From the crucible of the Pentagon on 9/11 and spearheading the response to the most significant intrusion into the Defense Department’s classified networks, to the Wars in Iraq in Afghanistan, Nakasone has served as one of the most influential problem-solvers at the center of cyber and information operations and dedicated his career to being a steadfast guardian of our national security interests.

In addition to his standing as a career Army officer who climbed the ranks to lead elite units battling the world’s top cyber hackers, Nakasone is widely recognized as an agent of innovation who championed new approaches to solving multifaceted challenges in rapidly changing landscape of cyber threats. His persistent approach to cyber defense against nation-state hackers has redefined the national and global security playbooks, while his emphasis on partnerships fostered a collaborative ecosystem transcending international, interagency, and private sector agencies. Under his stewardship, transparency became a cornerstone for his teams, elevating the confidence and trust of the American people in the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command. He retired as Commander of U.S. Cyber Command, Director of the NSA, and Chief of the Central Security Service on February 1, 2024 — having served in those roles since May 2018. General Nakasone’s remarkable service has been recognized with innumerable awards and decorations. Among them are the Distinguished Service Medal, Defense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Bronze Star, and Defense Meritorious Service Medal — to name a few.

 COMPSAC 2023 Theme: Resilient Computing and Computing for Resilience  
  in a Sustainable Cyber-Physical World   
   
 COMPSAC is the IEEE Computer Society Signature Conference on Computers, Software, and Applications. For almost 50 years, COMPSAC has been a central international forum for academia, industry, and government to present and discuss research results and advancements, emerging challenges, and future trends in computer hardware, software technologies, systems, and applications. The theme of COMPSAC 2023 is “ Resilient Computing and Computing for Resilience in a Sustainable Cyber-Physical World.  ”  
 The last few renditions of COMPSAC, which have been online because of COVID-19, have had profound consequences on our academic and industrial R&D communities. Yet these communities have shown resilience  in the face of this adversity. Accordingly, we are introducing a new vision for both the theoretical and practical aspects of the fields of interest of our participating communities: resilient computing and computing for resilience  .  
 During the pandemic-induced chaos of the last few years, the world has mainly managed to resist chaos and maintain a sense of order and stability. This resistance has brought a new focus and meaning to our technology research direction, i.e., resiliency, availability, and sustainability. As we go forward, we have learned that we must carefully prepare a variety of alternatives, keep them in operation, and continue to adapt them and us to changing circumstances. For instance, the notion of security can be interpreted as the maintenance of high availability. It can also be said that resilience is the ability to keep the lights burning, even if the quality of stability is significantly reduced.  
 Inspired by these thoughts, COMPSAC 2023, which is organized as a tight union of symposia, will focus on all the innovative research aspects of computing in a sustainable cyber-physical world,  including resilience computing, security, healthcare analytics, e  -government and e  -society, metaverse worlds, intelligent autonomous systems, Internet of Things networks, explainable artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and virtual augmented reality. The technical program will include keynote addresses, research papers, industrial case studies, fast abstracts, a doctoral symposium, poster sessions, workshops, and tutorials on emerging and important topics related to the conference theme. Highlights of the conference will include plenary and specialized panels that will address the technical challenges facing researchers and practitioners who are driving fundamental changes in Computers, Software, and Applications in Resilience Computing Systems and Tools. Panels will also address cultural and societal challenges raised by rapidly changing communication norms concerning computing and collaboration.  
 Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research work and industrial practice reports. Simultaneous submission to other publication venues is not permitted except as highlighted in the COMPSAC 2023 JC & CJ program. All submissions must adhere to IEEE Conference Publishing Policies  and will be vetted through the IEEE CrossCheck  portal.

 Gen. Paul M. Nakasone  
 Former Commander, U.S. Cyber Command & Former Director  
 A name synonymous with visionary leadership, retired four-star Army General Paul M. Nakasone is the longest-serving leader of the U.S. Cyber Command and the National Security Agency/Central Security Service, and is regarded among an elite class of leaders whose strategic expertise at the nexus of cybersecurity, technology, and geopolitics has laid the groundwork for upholding our nation’s security in the modern age. General Nakasone’s career spans more than three decades of pivotal moments in modern warfare and digital defense and he draws upon his experiences constantly at the epicenter of conflict to share battle-tested lessons on transformational leadership, while also examining the challenges and opportunities organizations face in the ever-evolving tech and security landscape. Exclusively represented by Leading Authorities speakers bureau, Nakasone is an engaging and dynamic speaker who leads audiences on a fascinating exploration into how our experiences today, paired with the advent of rapid and constant technological change, will shape the future — and what that means for how we approach the safety and security of our systems and society. Pointing to strategies that consistently led him and his teams to mission success in his own career, Nakasone shares recent examples of complex situations in which innovative ideas provided the catalyst for successful outcomes. As part of his talks, Nakasone emphasizes the skills that need to be sharpened in order to make a transformational impact as a leader, as well as the importance of purposefully recruiting, training, and retaining talent. He is of the belief that, ultimately, what shapes our future is fully dependent on the manner in which organizations invest leadership and talent. From the crucible of the Pentagon on 9/11 and spearheading the response to the most significant intrusion into the Defense Department’s classified networks, to the Wars in Iraq in Afghanistan, Nakasone has served as one of the most influential problem-solvers at the center of cyber and information operations and dedicated his career to being a steadfast guardian of our national security interests. He was also part of the select group of leaders that conceptualized and built U.S. Cyber Command from the ground up, and subsequently led their most elite forces before rising to command the entire organization, as well as the NSA/Central Security Service. In addition to his standing as a career Army officer who climbed the ranks to lead elite units battling the world’s top cyber hackers, Nakasone is widely recognized as an agent of innovation who championed new approaches to solving multifaceted challenges in rapidly changing landscape of cyber threats. His persistent approach to cyber defense against nation-state hackers has redefined the national and global security playbooks, while his emphasis on partnerships fostered a collaborative ecosystem transcending international, interagency, and private sector agencies. Under his stewardship, transparency became a cornerstone for his teams, elevating the confidence and trust of the American people in the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command. He retired as Commander of U.S. Cyber Command, Director of the NSA, and Chief of the Central Security Service on February 1, 2024 — having served in those roles since May 2018. General Nakasone’s remarkable service has been recognized with innumerable awards and decorations. Among them are the Distinguished Service Medal, Defense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Bronze Star, and Defense Meritorious Service Medal — to name a few.

 Abstract  
 en    
   
 This book constitutes the thoroughly refereed proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Abstract State Machines, B, TLA, VDM and Z, which took place in Toulouse, France, in June 2014. The 13 full papers presented together with 3 invited talks and 19 short papers were carefully reviewed and selected from 81 submissions. The ABZ conference series is dedicated to the cross-fertilization of six related state-based and machine-based formal methods: Abstract State Machines (ASM), Alloy, B, TLA, VDM and Z. They share a common conceptual foundation and are widely used in both academia and industry for the design and analysis of hardware and software systems. The main goal of this conference series is to contribute to the integration of these formal methods, clarifying their commonalities and differences to better understand how to combine different approaches for accomplishing the various tasks in modeling, experimental validation and mathematical verification of reliable high-quality hardware/software systems.

 ICER Conference  
 Computing education, as a research discipline, is the study of how people come to understand computational processes and devices, and how to improve that understanding. As computation becomes ubiquitous in our world, understanding of computing in order to design, structure maintain, and utilize these technologies becomes increasingly important both for the technology professional, but also for the technologically literate citizen. The research study of how the understanding of computation develops, and how to improve that understanding, is critically important for the technology-dependent societies in which we live.  
 The International Computing Education Research (ICER) conference aims at gathering high-quality contributions to the computing education research discipline. It has been held annually since 2005 at sites around the world, and recently has been attracting an audience of over 100 computing education researchers.

 SUPERCOMPUTINGASIA 2023 & HPC ASIA 2023  

 Sustainable Supercomputing  
  For a Greener Future  

 27 February - 2 March 2023 | SINGAPORE EXPO CONVENTION & EXHIBITION cENTRE  

 The SupercomputingAsia (SCA) conference aims to be a major supercomputing conference in Asia, where top supercomputers in the world are located. Co-organised by supercomputing centres of the region including those in Australia, Japan, Singapore and Thailand and anchored by the National Supercomputing Centre (NSCC) Singapore, it incorporates a number of important supercomputing and allied events that together aim to promote a vibrant and shared high-performance computing (HPC) ecosystem, for both the public and private sectors, in Asia.  
 The International Conference on High Performance Computing in the Asia-Pacific Region (HPC Asia) is an international conference series for the Asia Pacific region on HPC technologies that fosters exchange of ideas, research results and case studies related to all issues of HPC. For the first time ever, HPC Asia 2023 will be co-located with SCA23 in Singapore. The HPC Asia and SCA events synergise the collaborative and collective strengths from two of Asia’s established conferences by bringing together key HPC researchers, academics, technology specialists and industry leaders from across the region and beyond.  
 In addition  , Conference on Next Generation Arithmetic (CoNGA), the leading conference on emerging technologies for computer arithmetic, will also be back once again and will be held in conjunction with SCA23. Gain the latest news and updates on the developments of breakthroughs with next generation data formats and their corresponding hardware, tools, applications and services and exchange ideas on what next generation arithmetic should be.

 Message from Co-Chairs  

 On behalf of the SupercomputingAsia 2023 (SCA23) Steering and Organising Committees, we are happy to announce that the SCA23 Conference will be held in Singapore from 27 February – 2 March 2023 at the Singapore Expo Convention & Exhibition Centre. This is the first time in three years that the SCA conference will be returning to the stage as a fully in-person conference. We look forward to welcoming you back to Singapore and to reigniting the personal reconnections, networking collaborations and camaraderie within the global HPC community.   
   
 Co-organised by HPC centres from Australia (NCI and Pawsey), Japan (RIKEN R-CCS) and Singapore  
  (NSCC), the SCA conference is also proud to welcome our newest co-organising partner, Thailand,  
  (ThaiSC). The SCA is an annual conference that encompasses an umbrella of notable supercomputing  
  and allied events in Asia and beyond with the goal to promote a vibrant and shared high-performance computing (HPC) ecosystem in Asia.  

 SCA23 is unique. This is also the first year where the conference is co-located with the regional HPC Asia 2023 conference which will be held outside of China, South Korea and Japan for the first time ever. Together with the Conference on Next Generation Arithmetic (ConGA) and a slew of the SCA’s mainstay topics covering areas such as the latest HPC research and technologies, AI, networking data centres, cybersecurity, cloud computing and quantum computing, SCA23 promises to be a dynamic and forward-looking event   
   
 Decarbonisation, green electrons, carbon neutrality are some of the trending keywords that are helping to shape societies and economies in Asia and around the world. With the urgency for nations to look more closely at sustainability and to seek out alternative solutions to green power generation, lower carbon emissions and environmental conservation, the demand for HPC to power the research in these areas becomes even greater. The theme “Sustainable Supercomputing for a Greener Future” reflects the role that HPC could play in advancing decarbonisation research technologies and solutions but also explores the impact that more supercomputers, HPC resources and data centres could have on the future. Greener supercomputing infrastructure, more advanced data-intensive research and cross-border collaborations are driving efforts for HPC adoption and application in a world emerging from the pandemic, especially in areas like weather & climate change and green data centres.   
   
 So come and join us at our annual SCA conference to experience a dynamic, forward-looking programme that seeks to prepare the HPC community for what lies ahead.  
 We look forward to welcoming all of you to Singapore at SCA23!
