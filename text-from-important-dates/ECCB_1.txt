  About the ISMB/ECCB 2023 Conference  
 The annual international conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) is the flagship meeting of the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB). The 2023 conference is the 31st ISMB conference, which has grown to become the world's largest bioinformatics and computational biology conference. Joining forces with the European Conference on Computational Biology (22nd Annual Conference) ISMB/ECCB 2023 will be the year's most important computational biology event globally.  
 The conference will offer both in-person and virtual attendance. We will welcome you to join us in Lyon, France or virtually in our state of the art virtual interface.  
 ISMB/ECCB brings together scientists from computer science, molecular biology, mathematics, statistics and related fields. Its principal focus is on the development and application of advanced computational methods for biological problems.  
   
  Participants will have the opportunity to enjoy:  
 Training workshops and tutorials 
  Student Council Symposium 
  Live and on-demand sessions to benefit attendees from all time zones 
  500+ expected scientific talks 
  Live question and answer feature to engage with the speaker during sessions 
  Live chat feature to engage with other participants within your virtual session room 
  Dedicated time for research presentation within the Research Exchange Forum (formerly Poster Hall) both face to face and via the virtual platform 
  Speaker meet ups for our virtual audience 
  Face to face networking events for our in-person audience 
  Ability to serendipitously make new connections when utilizing the attendee profile and match maker features within the virtual platform

  Exclusive access to the ISMB/ECCB 2023 on-demand repository of talks and poster presentations for viewing at your leisure after conference dates 
  ISMB provides an intense multidisciplinary forum for disseminating the latest developments in bioinformatics/computational biology, fostering fresh dialogues and perspectives to learn about and shape the future of the field. In response to the increasing interest in the activities of the ISCB’s Communities of Special Interest (COSIs) the conference is organized with the active participation of the COSIs in the development of the program and highlights emerging or "hot" research areas providing an outstanding scientifically effective program.  
 ISMB enables intensified community involvement and bolsters its reputation as the leading conference in the field, with the strongest scientific and technical program that showcases the best international developments in bioinformatics and computational biology.
