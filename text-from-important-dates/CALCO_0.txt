 10th Conference on Algebra and Coalgebra in Computer Science  
 CALCO aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with interests in foundational aspects, and both traditional and emerging uses of algebra and coalgebra in computer science. It is a high-level bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces and reputations of CMCS  (the International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science), and WADT  (the Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques). Previous CALCO editions took place in Swansea  (Wales, 2005), Bergen  (Norway, 2007), Udine  (Italy, 2009), Winchester  (UK, 2011), Warsaw  (Poland, 2013), Nijmegen  (The Netherlands, 2015), Ljubljana  (Slovenia, 2017), London  (United Kingdom, 2019), and Salzburg  (Austria, 2021).  
 The proceedings of both CALCO 2023  and MFPS XXXIX  are published.
