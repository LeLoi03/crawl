 About DeSE2023  

 DeSE is an international core ranked non-profit conference that disseminates the latest knowledge in eSystem Developments including; Artificial Intelligence (AI), Intelligent Systems Applications, Evolutionary Computations, Fuzzy Systems, Neural Networks, Bioinformatics and Bioengineering, robotics, Smart Applications, Sensors and other related subjects that support Industry 4.0. and related to AI, Emergent Technologies, Cognitive and Development Systems, Intelligent Computation and Machine Learning.  
 We are very proud that back in 2009, the father of Fuzzy Logic  ( Professor Lotfi A. Zadeh),  was the keynote speaker of DeSE2009 conference.   
  The technical sponsorship is with proceedings that have been published annually by IEEE explore since the start of DeSE back in 2008.  DeSE2023 organising committee have been involved in minimum 10 years organisation experience. Hence, the organising committee have been involved since 2008 in different series of DeSE.     
 DeSE2023 will provide a leading forum for disseminating the latest results in eSystem Development, AI, Sensors, and Industry 4.0.  
  Currently a high level of interest is being generated through the development of a wide end varied range of eSystems. There are many high profile projects, all around the world, seeking to transfer many services and facilities into state-of-the-art electronic technologies.
