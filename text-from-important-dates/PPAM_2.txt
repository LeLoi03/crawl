 HOW TO GET TO BIALYSTOK?   
 For foreign participants, the most convenient way to get to Białystok are direct buses between the Warsaw Fryderyk Chopin Airport and Białystok bus terminal | (the duration of travel is from 2.30h to 3h). Buses are rather frequent, and practically starts from Warsaw at 6:15 and finish at 22:15. The bus terminal is located next to the train station - | please follow the purple line | ( | see the map... | ). The timetable is available at the following link: | https://www.busy-krk.pl/en/chopin-airport-bialystok/ | . | Tickets could be purchased online on the carriers websites | PlusBus | and | ŻakExpress | . 
  There are frequent direct trains from Warsaw to Bialystok. It is best to use the | on-line rail route planner | (leaving 'Warszawa Centralna' or 'Warszawa Lot. Chopina' arriving 'Bialystok'). 
  The simplest way to get to conference hotels from Bialystok Railway Station or Bialystok Bus Station is to take TAXI, which is not expensive (up to 5 Euro). | Below is the list of recommended carriers (taxis are marked with phone numbers): | Comfort Taxi, +48 800 111 111, +48 85 744 44 44 
  Taxi Sezam +48 85 661 61 61, +48 85 196 28

  13th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PARALLEL PROCESSING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS  
 Bialystok, Poland, September 8-11, 2019 http://ppam.pl  
 The PPAM 2019 conference, thirteenth in a series, will cover topics in parallel and distributed computing, including theory and applications, as well as applied mathematics. The focus will be on models, algorithms, and software tools which facilitate efficient and convenient utilization of modern parallel and distributed computing architectures, as well as on large-scale applications, including artificial intelligence and machine learning problems.  
 PPAM is a biennial conference started in 1994, with the proceedings published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Sciences series. The PPAM Proceedings are indexed in main databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, and DBLP. In particular, all the Proceedings of PPAM conferences published in the Springer LNCS series  , including the last PPAM 2017 Conference, are covered by the Web of Science (Clarivate).  
 In 2019 the PPAM conference will take place in Bialystok, the largest city in northeastern Poland, academic and cultural centre, located close to the world-famous Bialowieza Forest.  
   
  The PPAM 2019 conference is organized by the Department of Computer and Information Science of the Czestochowa University of Technology together with the Bialystok University of Technology, under the patronage of the Committee of Informatics of the Polish Academy of Sciences, in technical cooperation with the IEEE Computer Society and IEEE Computational Intelligence Society.  

 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Parallel/distributed architectures, enabling technologies 
  Cluster, cloud and fog computing 
  Multi-core and many-core parallel computing, GPU computing 
  Heterogeneous/hybrid computing and accelerators
