 WELCOME TO MICCAI  2023  FLYER   
 Dear colleagues  
 The 26 th  International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention, MICCAI 2023, will be held from October 8 th  to 12 nd  2023 in Vancouver Convention Centre Canada.  
 The MICCAI 2023 organizing committee and the local team in Canada have been working diligently at planning the conference for years. We are dedicated to making sure that MICCAI 2023 will be a great experience for everyone!  
 As you all know, the annual MICCAI conference attracts the world’s leading biomedical scientists, engineers, and clinicians from a wide range of disciplines associated with medical imaging and computer assisted intervention. The conference series includes three days of scientific content, including oral presentations and poster sessions. Workshops, tutorials, and challenges are held on the days preceding and succeeding the conference. Delegates can enjoy many different session formats in these satellite events that offer a comprehensive forum to further explore topics relevant to MICCAI. Industrial sessions and exhibitions provide interesting opportunities of exchange between academia and industry. The Students and Women in MICCAI board will complete the program with exciting social events.  
 In the months to follow, we will send out many emails announcing what is planned and giving more details. Watch out for those as we share even more exciting news about MICCAI 2023! Meanwhile, do take note that the deadline for paper submission is March 9 th  , 2023.  
 On behalf of the entire organizing committee, we look forward to meeting each one of you next year, face to face if possible. See you all in Vancouver!  
 Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood, General Chair
