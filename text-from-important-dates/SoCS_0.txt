 The 16th International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS)   
 Aquapalace Hotel Prague, Czech Republic   
 July 14 - July 16, 2023 (just after ICAPS)   

 Heuristic search and other forms of combinatorial search optimization are a very active areas of research in artificial intelligence, robotics, planning, discrete optimization and other areas of computer science and operations research. The International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS) is meant to bring researchers in such areas together to exchange their ideas and cross-fertilize the field.   
 SoCS serves researchers and submissions in all fields that use combinatorial search, including artificial intelligence, planning, robotics, constraint programming, meta-reasoning, operations research, navigation and bioinformatics. We especially invite submissions presenting real-world applications of heuristic search.   
 SoCS 2023 will take place at  Aquapalace Hotel Prague   that offers a modern and technologically advanced conference center with a fast and stable internet connection. Its connection with the water park creates a completely unique experience.   
 The conference already obtained funding from NSF and AIJ for supporting student participation at SoCS 2023.   
 Proceeding of SoCS 2023  are published by AAAI Press as Vol. 16 No. 1: Sixteenth International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (ISBN-10 1-57735-882-1, ISBN-13 978-1-57735-882-4). Acceepted papers are available  here   .
