 IEEE Symposium on Swarm Intelligence (IEEE SIS)  
  
 The 2023 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium (SIS 2023) will be held in Mexico city, Mexico, in December 2023. It will be a part of the IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence 2023. The theme of the SIS 2023 is to provide a platform for researchers, academicians, students, engineers, and government officers from all over the world to share and exchange information in the swarm intelligence research areas ranging from algorithm development to real-world applications. Authors are invited to submit their original and unpublished work related to swarm intelligence, including research, theory, development, and applications.
