  September 18 - 22, 2023 / Ivano-Frankivs’k, UKRAINE   
 on ICT in EDUCATION, RESEARCH,  
  and INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS    
 18th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE   

 Dear Colleague,  
 ICTERI supports and respects all the aspects that help promote diversity in our conference community, which aspires to facilitate a truly international and multicultural gathering. Though we prefer physical assembly for the conference as the most effective mean for scientific exchange and community building, we fully understand that some people might be under higher risk or stricter constraints, like international travellers. This is the reason for our decision to run ICTERI 2023 in a hybrid mode  , which combines physical assembly and virtual participation for those colleagues, who are unable to attend physically due to valid reasons.  
 The information about the arrangements and requirements  related to the hybrid mode  of the conference are provided and updated at http://icteri.org/icteri-2023/hybrid/    
 ICTERI Conference Language  is ENGLISH  
 ICTERI  is a peer-reviewed  International Computer Science  conference that brings together academics and practitioners interested in the technological advances and business applications of Information and Communication Technologies and Infrastructures.  
 ICTERI focuses on real world applications  ; therefore authors should highlight the benefits of their results or experience for industry and services, in addition to academic world. Papers describing advanced prototypes  , systems  , tools  and techniques  and general survey  papers indicating future directions  are also encouraged. Both technological  and methodological  submissions are welcome. All papers must describe original work  , not previously published or submitted elsewhere.  
 ICTERI offers its infrastructure and facilities for the organizers of satellite Workshops   that match the scope of the conference.  
 ICTERI also hosts a PhD Symposium   for young researchers who are at the beginning of their career, such as Master  or PhD students  and also young researchers from industry  . It is a venue that provides expert environment for the presentation of the tractable ideas  and early results  of PhD projects or other research aiming at receiving a PhD.  
 ICTERI is also open to those who would like to give interactive presentations  of their research or demonstrations  of their software at the Poster and Demo Track  .  
  Starting from 2023, ICTERI publishes its post-proceedings (Main Conference, Poster, and PhD Symposium tracks) volume with Springer  in their CCIS Series   (approved by Springer for 2023). This is an international and highly reputable venue for conference and workshop proceedings. Springer post-proceedings volume contains the papers accepted by the ICTERI Program Committee   and is published shortly after the conference. ICTERI Springer CCIS volumes  are indexed by: DBLP   , EI-Compendex   , Mathematical Reviews   , SCImago   , Scopus   .  
 ICTERI 2023 does not charge any conference fee. Participation is free  .
