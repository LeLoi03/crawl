  Call for Papers formal papers - doctoral programme 16th Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics - CICM 2023 - 4–8 September 2023 Emmanuel College, Cambridge, UK (hybrid event) http://www.cicm-conference.org/2023 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Digital and computational solutions are becoming the prevalent means for the generation, communication, processing, storage and curation of mathematical information. CICM brings together the many separate communities that have developed theoretical and practical solutions for mathematical applications such as computation, deduction, knowledge management, and user interfaces. It offers a venue for discussing problems and solutions in each of these areas and their integration. *** CICM 2023 Invited Speakers *** Frédéric Blanqui | : | Progresses on proof systems interoperability 
  Mateja Jamnik | : | How can we make trustworthy AI? 
  Lawrence C. Paulson | : | Large-Scale Formal Proof for the Working Mathematician - Lessons learnt from the Alexandria Project 
  Martina Seidl | : | Never trust your solver: Certificates for SAT and QBF 
  *** CICM 2023 Programme committee *** see  https://www.cicm-conference.org/2023/cicm.php?event=&menu=pc  *** SUBMISSIONS *** CICM 2023 invites submissions in all topics relating to intelligent computer mathematics, in particular but not limited to * theorem proving and computer algebra * mathematical knowledge management * digital mathematical libraries CICM appreciates the varying nature of the relevant research in this area and invites submissions of different forms. Formal submissions will be reviewed rigorously and accepted papers will be published in a formal way: * regular papers (up to 15 pages including references) present novel research results * project and survey papers (up to 15 pages + bibliography) summarize existing results * system and dataset descriptions (up to 5 pages including references) present digital artifacts * system entry (1 page according to the given LaTeX template) provides metadata and a quick overview of a new tool or a new release of an existing tool Participants of CICM benefit a lot from the exchange with colleagues. In order to foster this we will provide at the conference an opportunity to make informal presentations (using posters or laptops) of work-in-progress, project announcements, position statements, and system demonstrations. Authors of system and dataset descriptions and system entries are strongly encouraged to take up this opportunity and give interested colleagues an in depth impression of their work. At the conference, the PC chairs will reveal the submission selected as the CICM 2023 Best Paper. *** Doctoral Programme *** PhD students are invited to participate in the doctoral programme which provides them with a forum to present early results and receive constructive feedback and mentoring. To attend, submit a two-page abstract of the thesis describing the research questions, research plans, completed and remaining research, evaluation plans and publication plans; a two-page CV that includes background information (name, university, supervisor), education (degree sought, year/status of degree, previous degrees), employments, relevant research experience (publications, presentations, attended conferences or workshops, etc). *** Participation / Hybrid Event *** CICM 2023 will be held as an hybrid event, participation is possible online or on-site. Authors of accepted papers can choose to present online or on-site, but at least one author needs to register for the conference. *** Important Dates *** - Abstract deadline: 3 April 2023 - Full paper deadline: 10 April 2023 - Reviews sent to authors: 9 May 2023 - Rebuttals due: 13 May 2023 - Notification of acceptance: 20 May 2023 - Camera-ready copies due: 12 June 2023 - Conference: 4–8 September 2023 Submissions to the doctoral programme - Submission deadline: 14 July 2023 - Notification of acceptance: 28 July 2023 All submissions should be made via EasyChair at  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm2023  CICM 2023 will have proceedings in form of a volume in the Springer LNAI series, using the LNCS style.
