 The 23rd International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications  

 The 23rd International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications (ICCSA 2023) will be held on July 3 - 6, 2023 in collaboration with the National Technical University of Athens and University of the Aegean, Athens, Greece.    
 ICCSA 2023 will be the next event in a series of highly successful International Conferences on Computational Science and Its Applications (ICCSA), previously held in Malaga, Spain (2022), Cagliari, Italy (2021), Online (2020), in Saint Petersburg, Russia (2019), Melbourne, Australia (2018), Trieste, Italy (2017), Beijing.

The first ICCSA conference was co-organized by C.J.K. Tan (UK) and M. Gavrilova (U of Calgary, Canada) in 2003.  
 Computational Science is a main pillar of most present research, industrial and commercial activities and plays a unique role in exploiting innovative Information and Communication Technologies.  
 The ICCSA Conference offers an opportunity to discuss new issues, tackle complex problems and find advanced solutions to enable shaping new trends in Computational Science.  
 Submitted papers will be subject to stringent peer review by at least three experts and carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of exposition.  
 All accepted papers will be included in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)  series which is indexed by Scopus, EI Engineering Index, Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation Index (included in ISI Web of Science), and several other indexing services. The papers will contain linked references, XML versions and citable DOI numbers.  

 Springer is able to manage ORCID ID related to the authors and the Proceedings Volumes Editors! Please add the ORCID ID related to each author of your submitted paper!!!     
 Warning: Fake ICCSA Conference by WASET   
  We have noticed the existence of organisations such as WASET that run fake “conferences” in order to make profit with the registration fees, often spoofing the names of real conferences. WASET claims to be organising a conference called ICCSA next year, which is a FAKE ICCSA conference.  
  The Real ICCSA conference has been organised by the ICCSA Society since 2003. We do not have any involvement with WASET. Please spread this news to your contacts and communities so that nobody mistakenly participates to such fake conferences.  
  WASET is predator publisher. Go to this Wiki Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Academy_of_Science,_Engineering_and_Technology
