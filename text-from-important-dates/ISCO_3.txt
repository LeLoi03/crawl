 SPECIAL ISSUE  
 Call for Papers   
 Discrete Applied Mathematics    
 Special Issue  :  Combinatorial Optimization ISCO 2022   
 NEW DEADLINE: FEBRUARY 15, 2023  
    
 ================================================================  
  
 We invite submissions of novel research articles for a special issue of Discrete Applied Mathematics  on Combinatorial Optimization  .  
 This special issue will be dedicated to the International Symposium on Combinatorial Optimization ISCO 2022 that was held online on May 18–20, 2022. However, the special issue is also open to papers that were not presented at the conference. Contributions arising from papers given at the symposium should be substantially extended and should cite the conference paper.  
 High-quality research papers are solicited to address theoretical as well as practical issues of Combinatorial Optimization. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Approximation algorithms 
  Branch-and-bound algorithms 
  Branch-and-cut-and price algorithms 
  Computational biology 
  Computational complexity 
  Computational geometry 
  Constraint Programming 
  Cutting plane algorithms 
  Exact and parameterized algorithms 
  Graph and network algorithms 
  Interior point methods 
  Linear and nonlinear (mixed-)integer programming 
  Local search algorithms 
  Multiobjective optimization 
  On-line algorithms 
  Polyhedral combinatorics 
  Randomized algorithms 
  Scheduling algorithms 
  All submissions will be thoroughly refereed according to the high standards of Discrete Applied Mathematics  .  
 Guide for authors can be found at:   
 https://www.elsevier.com/journals/discrete-applied-mathematics/0166-218x/guide-for-authors   
 Full papers must be submitted through the Elsevier Editorial Manager (EM) system ( https://www.editorialmanager.com/dam/default1.aspx  ). When submitting your paper, be sure to specify that the paper is a contribution for the special issue of ISCO 2022  , so that your paper is assigned to the Guest Editors. Please see the Author Instructions on the site if you have not yet submitted a paper through EM. Be sure to note that your work is intended for the special issue and to select the article type ISCO 2022  .  
 The NEW  deadline for submission is FEBRUARY 15, 2023  .  
 Accepted papers will be published online individually, before print publication.  
 Additional information about the special issue can be obtained from the Guest Editors.  
 We look forward to receiving your contribution.
