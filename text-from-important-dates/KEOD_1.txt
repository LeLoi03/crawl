 KEOD is part of IC3K    , the 16th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management.  
  Registration to KEOD allows free access to all other IC3K conferences.   
   
  IC3K 2024 will be held in conjunction with ICINCO 2024    , WEBIST 2024    and CoopIS 2024    .   
  Registration to IC3K allows free access to the ICINCO, WEBIST and CoopIS conferences (as a non-speaker).  

  New registrations are now only available at the conference welcome desk    

  Although the conference is back to the normal mode (i.e., in-person) speakers are allowed to present remotely if unable to travel to the venue (hybrid support).    
 Please visit the KEOD 2025 website

 Knowledge Engineering (KE) refers to all technical, scientific and social aspects involved in building, maintaining and using knowledge-based systems. KE is a multidisciplinary field, bringing in concepts and methods from several computer science domains such as artificial intelligence, databases, expert systems, decision support systems, information systems and software engineering. KE is also related to logic (both in mathematics and philosophy domains) and to the cognitive and social sciences and socio-cognitive engineering.  
   
  Ontology Development (OD) aims at building reusable semantic structures that can be informal vocabularies, catalogs, glossaries as well as more complex finite formal structures specifying types of entities and types of relationships relevant within a certain domain. Ontologies have been gaining interest and acceptance in computational audiences. For example, formal ontologies are increasingly used as one of the main sources of software development and methodologies for this end can be adapted to include ontology development. A wide range of applications is emerging, including library science, ontology-enhanced search, e-commerce, business process management and enterprise engineering, among others.  
   
  KEOD aims at becoming a major meeting point for researchers and practitioners interested in the study and development of methodologies and technologies for Knowledge Engineering and Ontology Development.
