 Tracks and Special Sessions   
  
 Besides the  Main Track   , ICLP 2023 will host additional tracks:   

 Applications Track    : this track invites submissions of papers on emerging and deployed applications of LP, describing all aspects of the development, deployment, and evaluation of logic programming systems to solve real-world problems, including interesting case studies and benchmarks, and discussing lessons learned.   

 Thematic Tracks    : ICLP 2023 will feature two thematic tracks inviting submissions that explore specific roles and potential for logic programming. The two thematic tracks are:   
 Logic Programming and Machine Learning 
  Logic Programming and  Explainability, Ethics, and Trustworthiness 

 Recently Published Research Track    : this track provides a forum to discuss important results related to logic programming that appeared recently (from January 2021 onwards) in selective journals and conferences, but have not been previously presented at ICLP.   

 System Demonstrations    : this track provides an opportunity to showcase logic programming systems and implementations in a live setting. This track is not designed to be sales pitches, demonstrations are a way for the community to see the relevance, potential, and innovation of the tool and allow time for discussion with its creator.   
 Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF) Sessions    : these are meant to provide an inclusive environment for colleagues with similar interests to meet for informal discussion. Proposers of BoF sessions should serve as discussion leaders only. BoFs are not intended to be presentations.   

 Submission Details   
  
 We note that papers accepted at ICLP may appear either in   
 Theory and Practice of Logic Programming Journal (TPLP), or 
  Technical Communication Proceeding (TC) published by Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS) 
  All accepted papers will be presented during the conference. Authors of accepted papers will, by default, be automatically included in the list of ALP members, who will receive quarterly updates from the Logic Programming Newsletter at no cost.   
 All submissions must be written in English.   
 Further details may be found on track-specific pages   
 See the  Important Dates      page for important dates.
