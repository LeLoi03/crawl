 ICPM 2020  

 CLICK HERE TO ENTER THE VIRTUAL CONFERENCE SYSTEM IF YOU ARE REGISTERED    
 After over 10 years of research, process mining has shown to be a rapidly growing discipline. This is testified by an established research community, publications in top conference and journals, over 30 commercial process mining vendors, and the thousands of organizations already applying process mining.  
 After the success of the first edition in Aachen, the conference is organized by the Department of Mathematics  of University of Padua  . University of Padua is the second oldest university in Italy, founded in 1222 by scholars and professors moving to Padua from Bologna. This makes the second oldest university in Italy and the fifth oldest university still in activity  in the world. As per 2017, the university counts around 60000 students. According to the The Times Higher Education  World University Rankings 2019  , Padua is the second best university in Italy, among those with more than 1000 students.  
 Thought leaders working on process mining will be present, as well as the leading businesses and vendors in process mining that support the conference. At the same time, the conference is neutral, and provides insights that are tool-independent. It features a diversified program, including exciting scientific talks, tool demonstrations, contests, and awards. Workshops on emerging topics and an industry day of excellent speakers complement the program.  
 This makes ICPM 2020 “the virtual place to be” for anyone working on process mining.  
 The Springer’s LNBIP volume has finally been published. It is available free of charges until 28 April at link https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-030-72693-5
