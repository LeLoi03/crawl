 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Cyber Security (IEEE CICS)  
  
 Computational Intelligence constitutes an umbrella of techniques, has proven to be flexible in solving dynamic and complex real-world problems. These techniques typically include Machine Learning, Fuzzy Logic, Evolutionary Computation, Intelligent Agent Systems, Neural Networks, Cellular Automata, Artificial Immune Systems, Game Theory and other similar computational models. These techniques are widely used in different cyber security applications such as online behavior monitoring, e-fraud detection, robust decision support modules to enhance the protection of computing devices and information infrastructure at different levels.  
  Cyber defense is a continuously changing attack landscape as the software/hardware components are added and/or updated more frequently at different layers of cyber systems for additional functionalities and/or improved usability while these may not be security-enabled. Attackers exploit these vulnerabilities and find attack paths to compromise the target systems. The multi-faceted Computational Intelligent (CI) techniques appear to provide an efficient security paradigm to deal with influx of new threats in next generation high-performance network infrastructures and large-scale smart applications. These approaches can also be used to augment defense-in-depth architectures and to add necessary security enhancements to the design, implementation and operation of legacy and future cyber-enabled systems.  
 Topics  
 The symposium will cover all the issues, research and development of the state-of-the-art CI-based technologies in solving various computer and information security problems. CI application areas include, but are not limited to:  
 Intrusion/malware detection, prediction, classification, and response 
  Models for survivable, resilient, and self-healing systems 
  Sensor network security, web security, wireless and 4G, 5G media security 
  Digital forensics, security information visualization 
  New sensor fusion and decision support for mobile device security 
  Self-awareness, auto-defensiveness, self-reconfiguration, and self-healing networking paradigm 
  Modeling adversarial behavior for insider and outsider threat detection 
  Cloud and virtualization security 
  Internet of Things (IoT) and end-point device security 
  Identity science, authentication, and access control 
  Social network security and privacy 
  Electronic healthcare security, privacy, and compliance 
  Big-Data and application security 
  Block-chain security
