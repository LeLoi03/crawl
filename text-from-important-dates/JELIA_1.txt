 About JELIA 2023  

 Welcome to JELIA 2023, the 18th edition of the European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence, to be held in Dresden by the International Center for Computational Logic of TU Dresden   .  
 Logics have, for many years, laid claim to providing a formal basis for the study and development of applications and systems in Artificial Intelligence. With the depth and maturity of formalisms, methodologies and logic-based systems today, this claim is stronger than ever.  
 The European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence   (or Journées Européennes sur la Logique en Intelligence Artificielle - JELIA) began back in 1988, as a workshop, in response to the need for a European forum for the discussion of emerging work in this field. Since then, JELIA has been organised biennially, with proceedings published in the Springer-Verlag series Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence   . Previous meetings took place in Roscoff France (1988), Amsterdam Netherlands (1990), Berlin, Germany (1992), York, UK (1994), Évora Portugal (1996), Dagstuhl, Germany (1998), Málaga, Spain (2000), Cosenza, Italy (2002), Lisbon, Portugal (2004), Liverpool, UK (2006), Dresden, Germany (2008), Helsinki, Finland (2010), Toulouse, France (2012), Madeira, Portugal (2014), Larnaca, Cyprus (2016), Rende Italy (2019), Klagenfurt, Austria (2021).  
 The increasing interest in this forum, its international level with growing participation from researchers outside Europe, and the overall technical quality, has turned JELIA into a major biennial forum for the discussion of logic-based approaches to artificial intelligence.
