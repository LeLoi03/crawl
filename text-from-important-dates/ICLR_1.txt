  We are very excited to be holding the ICLR 2024 annual conference in Kigali, Rwanda this year from May 1-5, 2023. The conference will be located at the beautiful Kigali Convention Centre / Radisson Blu Hotel  location which was recently built and opened for events and visitors in 2016. The Kigali Convention Centre is located 5 kilometers from the Kigali International Airport.  
 The in-person conference will also provide viewing and virtual participation for those attendees who are unable to come to Kigali, including a static virtual exhibitor booth for most sponsors.  
 We look forward to answering any questions you may have, and hopefully seeing you in Kigali.

 About Us   
 The International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR)    is the premier gathering of professionals   dedicated to the advancement of the branch of artificial intelligence called representation learning, but generally referred to as deep learning.    
 ICLR is globally renowned for presenting and publishing cutting-edge research on all aspects of deep learning used in the fields of artificial intelligence, statistics and data science, as well as important application areas such as machine vision, computational biology, speech recognition, text understanding, gaming, and robotics.       
 Participants at ICLR span a wide range of backgrounds, from  academic and industrial researchers, to entrepreneurs and engineers, to graduate students and postdocs.      
 A non-exhaustive list of relevant topics explored at the conference include:      
 unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning 
  representation learning for planning and reinforcement learning 
  representation learning for computer vision and natural language processing 
  metric learning and kernel learning 
  sparse coding and dimensionality expansion 
  hierarchical models 
  optimization for representation learning 
  learning representations of outputs or states 
  optimal transport 
  theoretical issues in deep learning 
  societal considerations of representation learning including fairness, safety, privacy, and interpretability, and explainability 
  visualization or interpretation of learned representations 
  implementation issues, parallelization, software platforms, hardware 
  climate, sustainability 
  applications in audio, speech, robotics, neuroscience, biology, or any other field
