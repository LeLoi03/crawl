 Call for Papers  

 The 2023 International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications   
 - ICCSA 2023 -   

 National Technical University of Athens and University of the Aegean, Athens, Greece   
 July 3-6, 2023   
  
 The ICCSA 2023 conference will be organized in Athens, Greece.  Virtual registration (with a reduced registration fee) is still possible but in the spirit of facilitating researchers suffering from very critical economic and political situations. Besides online sessions, there will be pure on-site sessions with presential participation.    
 ICCSA 2023 will be the next event in a series of highly successful International Conferences on Computational Science and Its Applications (ICCSA), previously held in a blended form in Malaga - Spain (2023), in Cagliari - Italy (2021), online (2020, as an online-only event due  to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions)  , Saint Petersburg - Russia (2019), Melbourne - Australia (2018), Trieste - Italy (2017), Beijing - China (2016), Banff - Canada (2015), Guimaraes - Portugal (2014), Ho Chi Minh City - Vietnam (2013), Salvador da Bahia - Brazil (2012), Santander - Spain (2011), Fukuoka - Japan (2010), Suwon - Korea (2009), Perugia - Italy (2008), Kuala Lumpur - Malaysia (2007), Glasgow - United Kingdom (2006), Singapore - Singapore(2005), Assisi - Italy (2004), Montreal - Canada (2003), and, as ICCS, in Amsterdam - The Netherlands (2002) and San Francisco - USA (2001).  
  
 Computational Science is a central pillar of most of the present research, industrial and commercial activities and plays a unique role in exploiting innovative ICT technologies.  
 The ICCSA Conference offers an opportunity to bring together scientists of different disciplines, discuss new issues, tackle complex problems and find advanced solutions breeding new trends in Computational Science.  
 Submitted papers will be subject to stringent peer review by at least three experts and carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of exposition. Accepted papers will appear in the Conference proceedings to be published by Springer-Verlag in Lecture Notes in Computer Science  . The authors of a selected number of top-quality papers will be requested to extend their papers for further review and publication as special issues in highly recognized international journals.  
 ICCSA 2023 accepts paper submissions in the following categories: General Tracks and Workshops' Full Papers, General Tracks and Workshops' Short Papers and PhD Showcase Papers. The details for each paper submission category can be found at the URL https://iccsa.org/instructions-for-authors  and the list of Workshops at the URL: https://www.iccsa.org/workshops  .

 Paper Submission  
 To submit a paper, please connect to the Submission site from the link available at the ICCSA 2023 website: https://ess.iccsa.org  .  
  Only papers submitted through the electronic system and strictly adhering to the relevant format will be considered for reviewing and publication.  
  The submission may fall into the following categories: General Tracks and  Workshops' Full Papers, General Tracks and Workshops' Short Papers, and PHD Showcase Papers  .  
 GENERAL TRACKS AND WORKSHOPS' FULL PAPERS   
  The submitted paper must be between 12 to 18 pages long  for LNCS   publication  ,, and should be formatted according to the LNCS  rules.  
  Please consult the URL  https://iccsa.org/instructions-for-authors  for formatting information and templates.  
 SHORT PAPERS   
  Reporting preliminary results of ongoing research. The submitted paper must be between 8 and 11 pages long and formatted according to LNCS   rules  . The Short Papers will be presented during the conference and will be published by LNCS  .  
 PHD SHOWCASE PAPERS
