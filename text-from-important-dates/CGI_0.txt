 About Us  

 COMPUTER GRAPHICS INTERNATIONAL, Shanghai 2023  
 CGI is one of the oldest annual international conferences on Computer Graphics in the world. Researchers are invited to share their experiences and novel achievements in various fields of Computer Graphics and Virtual Reality. Previous recent CGI conferences have been held in Sydney, Australia (2014), Strasbourg, France (2015), Heraklion, Greece (2016), Yokohama, Japan (2017), Bintan, Indonesia (2018), and Calgary in Canada (2019). CGI has been virtual between 2020 and 2022 due to the COVID pandemic.  
 This year, CGI 2023 is organized by Shanghai Jiao Tong University and University of Sydney, and supported by the Computer Graphics Society (CGS), with the assistance of Wuhan Textile University and the STATE KEY LABORATORY OF COMPUTER SCIENCE (SKLCS), CGI 2023 will (hopefully) be held as a hybrid event-allowing both onsite and online participation – in Shanghai. The Visual Computer is the official journal of the Computer Graphics Society.  
 The main topics of the CGI 2023 conference are the following:   
 Rendering Techniques 
  Metaverse (VR/MR/XR) 
  Physically Based Modeling 
  Machine Learning for Computer Graphics 
  Data Compression for Graphics 
  Image Based Rendering and ModelingGeometric Computing

 GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR PAPERS SUBMISSIONS      
  
 The scientific program of the conference will include accepted papers from the first call for papers and these accepted papers will be published by Springer in the Visual Computer Journal  (impact factor 2.835) by Springer-Verlag.   
 The accepted papers from the second call for papers will be included either in the CGI conference Proceedings published by LNCS, Springer  , or   in the VRIH journal   (Virtual Reality and Intelligent Hardware journal published by Science Press), or  in the CAVW journal   (Computer Animation and Virtual Worlds) published by Wiley.   
 Note that for ALL submissions, the review process is double blind  , which requires the paper and all supplemental materials to be anonymous. Ensure that self-referencing is anonymous (refer to your full name rather than “I” or “we”). Avoid providing information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgements (e.g. co-workers and grant IDs) and in the supplemental material (e.g. titles in the movies, or attached papers). Avoid providing links to websites that identify the authors. Violation of any of these guidelines will lead to rejection without review.
