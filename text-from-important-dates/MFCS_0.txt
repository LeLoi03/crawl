  Sponsors and partners: | The MFCS conference series on Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science is a high-quality venue for original research in all branches of Theoretical Computer Science.  
 MFCS is among the conferences with the longest history in the field—the first conference in the series was held already in 1972. Traditionally, the conference moved between the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland, while since 2013, the conference has traveled around Europe.  
 In 2023, at its 48th edition, MFCS will be held in Bordeaux, France. Barring substantial and unforeseen developments, MFCS will be organized as a physical event, and at least one author of each accepted paper must register at the conference.

 Conference venue  
 The conference venue is ENSEIRB MATMECA, 1 Avenue du Dr Albert Schweitzer, 33400 Talence  . It is easily accessible by Tramway B, stop "Arts et Métiers".  
 The venue is opened every day at 8h30am, with a welcome breakfast. Talks start at 9am.

 Afterwards we will go to the restaurant « Le café du port », there  . The dinner will start at 20h. The restaurant is accessible from the museum by walking (40 minutes of a gentle walk by the quays) or by Tramway B, bus 91 or even by boat « Batcub 3 ».  
  
  Sightseeing  
 In case you have free time, we recommend the following activities: Walking around the old city center which is quite well preserved, mainly the quartier Saint-Michel (https://www.google.fr/maps/@44.8342269,-0.5661775,19.29z?entry=ttu) and/or the quartier Saint-Pierre (https://www.google.fr/maps/@44.8396473,-0.570616,19.54z?entry=ttu). 
  Walking about 45 min along the quays from south to north, either on the west (city) or on the east side (parks), accessible by tram. https://goo.gl/maps/YLimAZJWbpxhRn4z7 
  The Pey-Berland cathedral (https://www.google.fr/maps/@44.8374421,-0.5782952,18.58z?entry=ttu) 
  House of wine in Bordeaux, ok for tasting. https://www.bordeaux-tourism.co.uk/tasting/maison-du-vin-bordeaux.html. Please note that there will be a social event around wine wednesday afternoon, as well.

  We advise you to book a hotel in Bordeaux downtown, near the B Tramway line so that you can enjoy both the conference in Talence  as well as the city center of Bordeaux where there are a lot of good options for dinner. There are good hotels around the conference site in Talence as well as along the Tram B line in Bordeaux, especially in the neighbourhoods Hôtel de Ville, Grand-Théâtre, Quinconces and Chartrons.  
  
  Restaurants  
 Concerning restaurants, we recommend the following options. Clearly not exhaustive there are many other good options. Restaurants in Talence downtown (nearby the conference venue).  Around Talence Centre-Forum, the central spot in Talence  , you will find several options including french, italian, asian, north-african, and so on... All options are ok.
