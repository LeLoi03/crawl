 Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming (PPoPP) 2023  
 February 25, 2023  - March 1, 2023

 «  2023 Stanford Conference (organized by HPC-AI Advisory Council) 
  SupercomputingAsia 2023 (SCA23) and HPC Asia 2023 » 
    
 We would like to invite you to submit your papers for the Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming (PPoPP) 2023 to be held from Fab 25 to Mar 1, 2023.  
 PPoPP is the premier forum for leading work on all aspects of parallel programming, including theoretical foundations, techniques, languages, compilers, runtime systems, tools, and practical experience. In the context of the symposium, “parallel programming” encompasses work on concurrent and parallel systems (multicore, multi-threaded, heterogeneous, clustered, and distributed systems; grids; datacenters; clouds; and large-scale machines). Given the rise of parallel architectures in the consumer market (desktops, laptops, and mobile devices) and data centers, PPoPP is particularly interested in work that addresses new parallel workloads and issues that arise out of extreme-scale applications or cloud platforms, as well as techniques and tools that improve the productivity of parallel programming or work towards improved synergy with such emerging architectures.  
 Important dates:   
 Full paper submission: August 17, 2022 
  Author response period: October 26–October 28, 2022 
  Author notification: November 7, 2022 
  Artifact submission to AE committee: November 16, 2022 
  Artifact notification by AE committee: December 30, 2022 
  Final paper due: January 6, 2023 
  All deadlines are at midnight anywhere on earth (AoE),  and are firm.
