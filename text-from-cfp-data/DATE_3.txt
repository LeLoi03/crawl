DATE puts a strong emphasis on both technology and systems, covering ICs/SoCs, reconfigurable hardware and embedded systems as well as embedded software.</p>
<p>The three-day event consists of a conference with regular papers, late breaking results papers and extended abstracts, complemented by timely keynotes, special days, focus sessions, embedded tutorials, half-day workshops and multi-partner project sessions. The event will also host the Young People Programme and unplugged sessions fostering the networking and the exchange of information on relevant issues, recent research outcomes and career opportunities.</p>
<p><span class="date-tag-blue">DATE 20<span class="date-tag-red">25</span></span> is the 28th edition of an event that has always been the place for researchers, young professionals and industrial partners to meet, present their research and discuss the current development and next trends, with high emphasis on social interaction.</p>
<p>At <span class="date-tag-blue">DATE 20<span class="date-tag-red">25</span></span>, the DATE community, again, comes together for the conference in an intensive three-day format, focussing on interaction as well as further strengthening the community. The vast majority of regular papers will be presented in technical sessions using short flash-presentations, where the emphasis is on poster-supported live interactions (in addition to the common full-length presentation videos available before, during and after the conference). By this, we continue to focus on the core value of conferences: meeting, discussing and exchanging.</p>

<p>This Special Day will focus in exploring the latest trends and innovations in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). AI (and mainly generative AI) is booming since the release of chat-GPT and it will change the future of Design, Automation and Test. This Special Day will highlight the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design of hardware architectures, including automatic exploration of large design spaces, assistance of the human designer, resource selection and optimisation</li>
<li>Verification of hardware architectures, with topics such as performance prediction, (formal) design validation, accelerating simulations thanks to AI-Augmented Surrogate Models</li>
<li>AI-Accelerated Physical Design and Validation of layout and floorplans</li>
<li>Sustainability in AI/ML Development.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the talks, AI/ML techniques such as Neural architecture search (NAS), Generative adversarial networks (GAN), Reinforcement learning, hybridisation of classical and AI techniques, federation of Small Language Models (or agents) will be discussed.</p>
<p>These topics will be presented by a lineup of distinguished speakers who are expert in their respective fields. The day will conclude with a panel discussion allowing exchanges with the audience and trigger discussions on the interaction between the various domains presented during the day.</p>

<h3 id="Special-Day-Emerging-Computing-Paradigms">Special Day "Emerging Computing Paradigms"</h3>
<p><em>-formerly "Unconventional Computing"-</em><br>Sustaining increasingly challenging compute workloads requires going beyond technology scaling with von Neumann architectures in traditional CMOS. Examples include NP-hard optimisation, massive sensor processing in IoT, as well as deep learning and artificial intelligence where training compute requirements grow by ~750x every two years. Therefore, rethinking computing toward more sustainable and efficient solutions is urgently needed. This can take place by bringing computation closer to its physical substrate, or by seeking new computing paradigms across all layers of the compute stack, thereby spanning architecture, circuit, and device solutions.</p>
<p>The Special Day on Emerging Computing Paradigms covers key emerging topics in the areas of quantum computing, neuromorphic engineering, physics-based computing, probabilistic computing, reversible and adiabatic computing, and cellular automata. Starting with talks by key experts and closing with a panel discussion, this Special Day aims to outline tradeoffs and synergies in the wide landscape of unconventional computing approaches.</p>

<h3 id="Autonomous-Systems-Design">Special Initiative “Autonomous Systems Design”</h3>
<p>Fueled by the progress of Artificial Intelligence, autonomous systems are increasingly becoming integral parts of many Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) applications, such as automated driving, robotics, avionics, industrial automation and smart systems in general. Autonomous systems are self-governed and self-adaptive systems that are designed to operate in an open and evolving environment, which is not completely defined at design time. This poses a unique challenge to the design and verification of dependable autonomous systems. The DATE Special Initiative on Autonomous Systems Design will include peer-reviewed papers, special sessions and interactive sessions addressing these challenges.</p>

<h2 id="Unplugged-Sessions">Unplugged Sessions on Unconventional Computing</h2>
<p>Come join us for stimulating brainstorm discussions in small groups about the future of digital engineering. Our focus this year will be on Unconventional Computing. Unconventional computing is computing by any of a wide range of new or unusual methods. Examples are analogue mechanical, analogue electrical, biological, membrane, optical, fluidics, micromechanical, etc. computing. In this session we will on the one hand look into different examples of unconventional computing and will subsequently explore the commonalities and foundations of these approaches. Abstraction and analogy seem to always be at the heart of unconventional computing approaches. Furthermore, the value (performance, cost, energy consumption) of these approaches seems to lie in their restriction to a particular class of problems. (Electrical) analogue computing for example excels at solving differential equations. We will try to chart the boundaries of operation where value is created.</p>
<p>We consider quantum computing to be outside the scope of the unplugged session.</p>
<p>If you want to get involved in the discussions, please contact the chairs accordingly.</p>

A recorded video presentation of the paper is also required, according to guidelines that will be made available. It should be noted that accepted Late Breaking Results papers will be published as submitted and are expected to be camera-ready, i.e., no separate camera-ready submission will be possible.</p>
<h2 id="Registration-Rule-for-all-accepted-papers">Registration Rule for All Accepted Papers</h2>
<p class="text-align-justify" style="margin-bottom:8px;margin-top:8px;">Please note that each paper shall be accompanied by at least one full conference registration at the paper author rate (i.e., two paper author registrations are needed for two accepted papers, e.g., from the main author or a co-author of the paper). <strong>DATE is a physically held conference, and not a hybrid conference.</strong> Therefore, it is mandatory that at least one author of each accepted paper attends the session where the paper is discussed and presents the work as requested, otherwise the paper will be deleted from the proceedings afterwards (despite full payment at the paper author rate).</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Focus-Sessions">Focus Sessions</h2>
<p>Focus Sessions can take the form of (1) Panels, discussing visionary and controversial issues or (2) Hot-Topic Sessions, focusing on the introduction and discussion of new R&amp;D problems, addressing trends in the technical domains that are of interest to the conference participants.</p>
<p>Focus Session proposals must consist of an extended summary of up to 1,500 words in a PDF file, describing the topic, the authors/speakers and the format and must be submitted at <a href="https://softconf.com/date25/focus-session/">https://softconf.com/date25/focus-session/</a> by <b>Friday, 11 October 2024 AoE</b>. The submitter of a Focus Session proposal will be notified of acceptance or rejection of his/her proposal by <b>Tuesday, 19 November 2024 AoE</b>. In case of acceptance, contributors of accepted Focus Sessions will be asked to submit final texts or statements of panellists, as appropriate, for publication in the proceedings as final, camera-ready manuscripts by <b>Friday, 17 January 2025 AoE</b>. Panel sessions are entitled to one (1) page per panellist in the proceedings; Hot-Topic Sessions are allocated a maximum of six (6) pages paper per speaker or one single paper for the entire session which should not exceed ten (10) pages. As a rule of thumb, no more than four speakers per session should be planned for Hot-Topic Sessions. For the accepted Focus Sessions, it is the responsibility of the Focus Session organiser(s) to ensure that the <b>Friday, 17 January 2025 AoE</b> deadline is met and all the camera-ready manuscripts from their respective Focus Sessions are technically sound and meet the editorial standards of the DATE proceedings. The Focus Session Co-Chairs may decline the publication of the final manuscripts in the DATE proceedings if the above responsibility is not fulfilled. Accepted or invited speakers to the Focus Sessions will be required to register for the conference.</p>
<p><strong>Further Instructions for Focus Session Submissions</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the above-stated important instructions, e.g. w.r.t. author list and double submissions, please adhere to the following:</p>
<p><strong>Session Chair/Co-Chair</strong>: Every special session submission must name a chair and a co-chair; the chair and the co-chair are responsible for the preparation of the session and for the monitoring of the session; they cannot be selected among the moderators/panelists, or speakers/presenters.</p>

<h2 id="Embedded-Tutorials">Embedded Tutorials</h2>
<p><span class="date-tag-blue">DATE 20<span class="date-tag-red">25</span></span> tutorial sessions are designed to provide audiences with an introduction to important topics in the DATE technical areas as well as hands-on tutorials on design automation tools. Early career professionals as well as graduate students will benefit from the introductory knowledge about important topics and tools. Mid-career professionals can attend tutorials to extend their horizons. Embedded tutorials will be 90-minute sessions "embedded" within the 3-day programme of DATE. We welcome proposals for tutorial presentations in the DATE <a href="#Topic-Areas-for-Submission">technical areas</a>. Proposals need to be submitted online before <b><s>Friday, 11 October 2024 AoE</s> Thursday, 31 October 2024 AoE</b>, via the DATE submission website <a href="https://softconf.com/date25/tutorials/">https://softconf.com/date25/tutorials/</a>.</p>
<p>Technical tutorials on selected topics will be given by leading experts in their respective fields. The submission should motivate the topic and its relevance for both academia and industry, specify whether it covers foundational topics or cutting-edge ones, describe the target audience (expected type of attendees? expected number? match with typical DATE audience?), the reason for a tutorial (why a tutorial, why now). Hands-on tutorials are welcomed. Moreover, the submission should include a brief abstract with a list of learning objectives, and a clear planning hereto (organisation in sessions, possible speakers, what will be done to attract the audience), and the DATE topic to which it is more closely related. We target few top-quality well-attended tutorials. In particular, we look for hands-on and tutorials on fundamentals which should clearly identified in the proposal. Extended conference talks will not be accepted as tutorials. Marketing of company tools are not accepted either.</p>
<p>A tutorial submission example is available <a href="/DATE2025-Tutorial-Template.docx">here for download</a>.</p>
<p>The tutorial organiser(s) will be notified of acceptance or rejection of submissions by <b>Friday, 15 November 2024 AoE</b>. In case of acceptance, final information about the tutorial structure (confirmed speakers, final abstract, final agenda) must be provided by <b>Friday, 17 January 2025 AoE</b>. Tutorial hand-out material (e.g. consisting of all slides and perhaps also background reading material) needs to be uploaded as a single PDF or ZIP file at the DATE website by <b><span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">TBD</span></b>. The hand-out material will be available to tutorial attendees only!</p>
