The Kitware Vision Group has collaborated with more than 20 universities and maintains active involvement in major vision conferences.</p>

<p>About the Projects:&nbsp;<br>
Kitware’s 3D computer vision team develops algorithms and open source applications for photogrammetry: reconstructing 3D models of objects from images and video. Current 3D projects have an emphasis on aerial and satellite imagery sources, but capabilities are often adapted to other problem domains. These projects have created and continue to support the development of TeleSculptor, an open source application for aerial 3D reconstruction built on KWIVER, and Danesfield, an open source Python framework and web application for urban 3D modeling from satellite imagery. Our 3D vision research projects support the continued development of these tools, development and publication of new cutting edge 3D reconstruction and camera calibration algorithms, and opportunities to leverage 3D vision to assist with broader computer vision topics. The team is exploring how 3D vision algorithms can aid in object detection and tracking, change detection, super resolution, video compression, super resolution, and various other problems. We frequently explore opportunities to adapt our work to new customers with new challenges and new data domains such as underwater imagery or synthetic aperture radar.</p>

<p>In this Position You Will:<br>
- Conduct research and develop solutions for problems related to camera calibration, registration, and 3D reconstruction from images<br>
- Contribute to the development of open source software such as TeleSculptor, KWIVER, or Danesfield<br>
- Collaborate with other researchers to brainstorm ideas and peer review work<br>
- Prepare and present research findings to customers and collaborators<br>
- Enjoy support and encouragement for participation in national and international conferences (such as CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, WACV, and 3DV)<br>
- Be encouraged to seek funding to grow and develop your own research areas, if you desire</p>

<p>Required Qualifications:&nbsp;<br>
- PhD in Computer Science or related field<br>
- Experience using multiview geometry to develop algorithms for building 3D point clouds or meshes from imagery or video<br>
- Experience with good software development practices and proficiency in C++ or Python or both.<br>
- Strong publication record in top-tier research publications and conferences such as CVPR, ICCV, and ECCV.<br>
- Highly innovative and demonstrated track record for solving difficult technical challenges using imagery<br>
- Experience collaborating successfully with others and thriving in a fast-paced and dynamic work environment<br>
