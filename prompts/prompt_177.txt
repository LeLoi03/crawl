 ISCA Industry Track: Call for Papers  
 At a Glance  
 First author, and most authors, | must be from industry 
  Not for student internship projects 
  Submissions | must include all author names and affiliations | for review (authors may remain blinded) 
  All ISCA | formatting guidelines | apply ( | 11 pages without references, 10pt font | ) 
  Rebuttal/Revision period: | February 23 - 27, 2023 
   Upload Abstracts and Papers to Industry Track HotCRP   
  Submission Guidelines  
 The papers ideally include (1) retrospective evaluations of real working products, (2) upcoming industry products on their roadmaps, and/or (3) planned products that were canceled but present interesting insights or lessons learned. 
  The following types of submissions will | not | be considered: (1) students' short-term internship projects in industries, or (2) speculation about hardware that might be built. 
  The first and most of the authors | of such papers must work in industry. 
  The submissions are required to disclose the affiliations of all authors. | Reviewers want to know which product is being evaluated and which company is writing the paper. Review assignments will still follow common practice to avoid conflicts of interest. 
  All | formatting guidelines | for the general submission (including page limits) must also be followed by any paper submitted to the industry track. The accepted paper will be labelled as an "Industry Product" in the conference proceedings. 
  Submissions that fail to abide by the guidelines will be rejected without review.  
  Important Dates  
 The program committee recognizes that industry papers need to be approved by management (often involving multiple rounds of redaction) before they can be submitted, and there can be restrictions about filing patents before submitting a paper. Therefore, a later deadline schedule is adopted to increase the chances of receiving such papers.  
  Topics of Interest  
 Paper topics are not limited to hardware tapeouts. In particular, papers that are software-centric papers relevant to the ISCA audience are welcome in this track (e.g. datacenter software work, compiler work accelerator software stack work), but they should adhere to the tenet that they must be industry papers about production-level work - whether retrospective, planned and on the roadmap, or planned but canceled.  
 Processors, SoCs, GPUs, and domain-specific accelerators 
  Systems and interconnect technologies for HPC, cloud, or data centers

  ISCO 2024 | What is ISCO?   
  ISCO (Integer Symposium on Combinatorial Optimization) is a biannual symposium whose aim is to bring together researchers from all the communities related to combinatorial optimization, including algorithms and complexity, mathematical programming, operations research, stochastic optimization, graphs and combinatorics. Quality papers on all aspects of combinatorial optimization, from mathematical foundations and theory of algorithms to computational studies and practical applications, are solicited.  
 Each ISCO conference is preceded or followed by a Spring School lectured by international Combinatorial Optimization searches. This school is dedicated to PhD students but the lectures are also opened to older colleagues.  
 Scope of ISCO   
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Approximation algorithms 
    The seventh  issue has be held online in May 2022  , due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This version has been organised with a French team directed by Ivana Ljubic and Pierre Fouilhoux. The spring school was titled "An introduction to quantum algorithms for optimization" wuth Giacomo Nannicini from the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, USA.  
  A special issue in Discrete Applied Mathematics (DAM) 2022 DAM special issue  has been dedicated to the 2022 edition.  
    The heigth  issue will be held in Tenerife, Spain in May 2024  (see website  ) organized with colleague of La Laguna around Juan José Salazar González. The sprinf school will focus on Combinatorial Optimization and Machine Learning with Amitabh Basu from Johns Hopkins University, USA, and Andrea Lodi from Cornell Tech and Technion, New York, USA.
