 Algorithms Transcending the SAT-Symmetry Interface   
 Authors:  Markus Anders, Pascal Schweitzer, and Mate Soos  
  Abstract    
 Dedicated treatment of symmetries in satisfiability problems (SAT) is indispensable for solving various classes of instances arising in practice. However, the exploitation of symmetries usually takes a black box approach. Typically, off-the-shelf external, general-purpose symmetry detection tools are invoked to compute symmetry groups of a formula. The groups thus generated are a set of permutations passed to a separate tool to perform further analyzes to understand the structure of the groups. The result of this second computation is in turn used for tasks such as static symmetry breaking or dynamic pruning of the search space. Within this pipeline of tools, the detection and analysis of symmetries typically incurs the majority of the time overhead for symmetry exploitation. In this paper we advocate for a more holistic view of what we call the SAT-symmetry interface. We formulate a computational setting, centered around a new concept of joint graph/group pairs, to analyze and improve the detection and analysis of symmetries. Using our methods, no information is lost performing computational tasks lying on the SAT-symmetry interface. Having access to the entire input allows for simpler, yet efficient algorithms. Specifically, we devise algorithms and heuristics for computing finest direct disjoint decompositions, finding equivalent orbits, and finding natural symmetric group actions. Our algorithms run in what we call instance-quasi-linear time, i.e., almost linear time in terms of the input size of the original formula and the description length of the symmetry group returned by symmetry detection tools. Our algorithms improve over both heuristics used in state-of-the-art symmetry exploitation tools, as well as theoretical general-purpose algorithms.

  Abstract    
 Recently, the proof system MICE for the model counting problem #SAT was introduced by Fichte, Hecher and Roland (SAT'22). As demonstrated by Fichte et al., the system MICE can be used for proof logging for state-of-the-art #SAT solvers. We perform a proof-complexity study of MICE. For this we first simplify the rules of MICE and obtain a calculus MICE' that is polynomially equivalent to MICE. Our main result establishes an exponential lower bound for the number of proof steps in MICE' (and hence also in MICE) for a specific family of CNFs.

  Abstract    
 Computing many useful properties of Boolean formulas, such as their weighted or unweighted model count, is intractable on general representations. It can become tractable when formulas are expressed in a special form, such as the decision-decomposable, negation normal form (dec-DNNF) . Knowledge compilation is the process of converting a formula into such a form. Unfortunately existing knowledge compilers provide no guarantee that their output correctly represents the original formula, and therefore they cannot validate a model count, or any other computed value. We present Partitioned-Operation Graphs (POGs), a form that can encode all of the representations used by existing knowledge compilers. We have designed CPOG, a framework that can express proofs of equivalence between a POG and a Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF). We have developed a program that generates POG representations from dec-DNNF graphs produced by the state-of-the-art knowledge compiler D4, as well as checkable CPOG proofs certifying that the output POGs are equivalent to the input CNF formulas. Our toolchain for generating and verifying POGs scales to all but the largest graphs produced by D4 for formulas from a recent model counting competition. Additionally, we have developed a formally verified CPOG checker and model counter for POGs in the Lean 4 proof assistant. In doing so, we proved the soundness of our proof framework. These programs comprise the first formally verified toolchain for weighted and unweighted model counting.

  Abstract    
 Modern SAT solvers are frequently embedded as sub-reasoning engines into more complex tools for addressing problems beyond the Boolean satisfiability problem. Examples include solvers for Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), combinatorial optimization, model enumeration and counting. In such use cases, the SAT solver is often able to provide relevant information beyond the satisfiability answer. Further, domain knowledge of the embedding system (e.g., symmetry properties or theory axioms) can be beneficial for the CDCL search, but cannot be efficiently represented in clausal form. In this paper, we propose a general interface to inspect and influence the internal behaviour of CDCL SAT solvers. Our goal is to capture the most essential functionalities that are sufficient to simplify and improve use cases that require a more fine-grained interaction with the SAT solver than provided via the standard IPASIR interface. For our experiments, we extend CaDiCaL with our interface and evaluate it on two representative use cases: enumerating graphs within the SAT modulo Symmetries framework (SMS), and as the main CDCL(T) SAT engine of the SMT solver cvc5.

  Abstract    
 Recently Dependency Quantified Boolean Formula (DQBF) has attracted a lot of attention in the SAT community. Intuitively, a DQBF is a natural extension of quantified boolean formula where for each existential variable, one can specify the set of universal variables it depends on. It has been observed that a DQBF with k existential variables - henceforth denoted by k-DQBF - is essentially a k-CNF formula in succinct representation. However, beside this and the fact that the satisfiability problem is NEXP-complete, not much is known about DQBF. In this paper we take a closer look at k-DQBF and show that a number of well known classical results on k-SAT can indeed be lifted to k-DQBF, which shows a strong resemblance between k-SAT and k-DQBF. More precisely, we show the following. a) The satisfiability problem for 2- and 3-DQBF is PSPACE- and NEXP-complete, respectively. b) There is a parsimonious polynomial time reduction from arbitrary DQBF to 3-DQBF. c) Many polynomial time projections from SAT to languages in NP can be lifted to polynomial time reductions from the satisfiability of DQBF to languages in NEXP. d) Languages in the class NSPACE[s(n)] can be reduced to the satisfiability of 2-DQBF with O(s(n)) universal variables. e) Languages in the class NTIME[t(n)] can be reduced to the satisfiability of 3-DQBF with O(log t(n)) universal variables. The first result parallels the well known classical results that 2-SAT and 3-SAT are NL- and NP-complete, respectively.

  Abstract    
 Extended resolution shows that auxiliary variables are very powerful in theory. However, attempts to exploit this potential in practice have had limited success. One reasonably effective method in this regard is bounded variable addition (BVA), which automatically reencodes formulas by introducing new variables and eliminating clauses, often significantly reducing formula size. We find motivating examples suggesting that the performance improvement caused by BVA stems not only from this size reduction but also from the introduction of effective auxiliary variables. Analyzing specific packing-coloring instances, we discover that BVA is fragile with respect to formula randomization, relying on variable order to break ties. With this understanding, we augment BVA with a heuristic for breaking ties in a structured way. We evaluate our new preprocessing technique, Structured BVA (SBVA), on more than 29 000 formulas from previous SAT competitions and show that it is robust to randomization. In a simulated competition setting, our implementation outperforms BVA on both randomized and original formulas, and appears to be well-suited for certain families of formulas.

  Abstract    
 Many current complete MaxSAT algorithms fall into two categories: core-guided or implicit hitting set. The two kinds of algorithms seem to have complementary strengths in practice, so that each kind of solver is better able to handle different families of instances. This suggests that a hybrid might match and outperform either, but the techniques used seem incompatible. In this paper, we focus on PMRES and OLL, two core-guided algorithms based on max resolution and soft cardinality constraints, respectively. We show that these algorithms implicitly discover cores of the original formula, as has been previously shown for PM1. Moreover, we show that in some cases, including unweighted instances, they compute the optimum hitting set of these cores at each iteration. We also give compact integer linear programs for each which encode this hitting set problem. Importantly, their continuous relaxation has an optimum that matches the bound computed by the respective algorithms. This goes some way towards resolving the incompatibility of implicit hitting set and core-guided algorithms, since solvers based on the implicit hitting set algorithm typically solve the problem by encoding it as a linear program.

 SAT-Based Generation of Planar Graphs   
 Authors:  Markus Kirchweger, Manfred Scheucher, and Stefan Szeider  
  Abstract    
 To test a graph’s planarity in SAT-based graph generation we develop SAT encodings with dynamic symmetry breaking as facilitated in the SAT modulo Symmetry (SMS) framework. We implement and compare encodings based on three planarity criteria. In particular, we consider two eager encodings utilizing order-based and universal-set-based planarity criteria, and a lazy encoding based on Kuratowski’s theorem. The performance and scalability of these encodings are compared on two prominent problems from combinatorics: the computation of planar Turán numbers and the Earth-Moon problem. We further showcase the power of SMS equipped with a planarity encoding by verifying and extending several integer sequences from the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) related to planar graph enumeration. Furthermore, we extend the SMS framework to directed graphs which might be of independent interest.

 On CNF Conversion for Disjoint SAT Enumeration   
 Authors:  Gabriele Masina, Giuseppe Spallitta, and Roberto Sebastiani  
  Abstract    
 Modern SAT solvers are designed to handle problems expressed in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) so that non-CNF problems must be CNF-ized upfront, typically by using variants of either Tseitin or Plaisted and Greenbaum transformations. When passing from solving to enumeration, however, the capability of producing partial satisfying assignments that are as small as possible becomes crucial, which raises the question of whether such CNF encodings are also effective for enumeration. In this paper, we investigate both theoretically and empirically the effectiveness of CNF conversions for disjoint SAT enumeration. On the negative side, we show that: (i) Tseitin transformation prevents the solver from producing short partial assignments, thus seriously affecting the effectiveness of enumeration; (ii) Plaisted and Greenbaum transformation overcomes this problem only in part. On the positive side, we show that combining Plaisted and Greenbaum transformation with NNF preprocessing upfront - which is typically not used in solving - can fully overcome the problem and can drastically reduce both the number of partial assignments and the execution time.

 Solving Huge Instances with Intel(R) SAT Solver   
 Authors:  Alexander Nadel  
  Abstract    
 Authors:  Albert Oliveras, Chunxiao Li, Darryl Wu, Jonathan Chung, and Vijay Ganesh  
  Abstract    
 In this paper we present the design and implementation of a Satisfaction-Driven Clause Learning (SDCL) SAT solver, MapleSDCL, which uses a MaxSAT-based technique that enables it to learn shorter, and hence better, redundant clauses. We also perform a thorough empirical evaluation of our method and show that our SDCL solver solves Mutilated Chess Board (MCB) problems significantly faster than CDCL solvers, without requiring any alteration to the branching heuristic used by the underlying CDCL SAT solver.

  Abstract    
 It has been shown that Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) problem instances can be effectively solved by partitioning the set of soft clauses into several disjoint sets. The partitioning methods can be based on clause weights (e.g., stratification) or based on graph representations of the formula. Afterwards, a merge procedure is applied to guarantee that an optimal solution is found. This paper proposes a new framework called UpMax that decouples the partitioning procedure from the MaxSAT solving algorithms. As a result, new partitioning procedures can be defined independently of the MaxSAT algorithm to be used. Moreover, this decoupling also allows users that build new MaxSAT formulas to propose partition schemes based on knowledge of the problem to be solved. We illustrate this approach using several problems and show that partitioning has a large impact on the performance of unsatisfiability-based MaxSAT algorithms.

  Abstract    
 In this paper, we present QMusExt, a tool for the extraction of minimal unsatisfiable sets (MUS) from quantified Boolean formulas (QBFs) in prenex conjunctive normal form (PCNF). Our tool generalizes an efficient algorithm for MUS extraction from propositional formulas that analyses and rewrites resolution proofs generated by SAT solvers. In addition to extracting unsatisfiable cores from false formulas in PCNF, we apply QMusExt also to obtain satisfiable cores from Q-resolution proofs of true formulas in prenex disjunctive normal form (PDNF).

  Abstract    
 DRAT is the standard proof format used in the SAT Competition. It is easy to generate but checking proofs often takes even more time than solving the problem. An alternative is to use the LRAT proof system. While LRAT is easier and way more efficient to check, it is more complex to generate directly. Due to this complexity LRAT is not supported natively by any state-of-the-art SAT solver. Therefore Carneiro and Heule proposed the mixed proof format FRAT which still suffers from costly intermediate translation. We present an extension to the state-of-the-art solver CaDiCaL which is able to generate LRAT natively for all procedures implemented in CaDiCaL. We further present Lrat-Trim, a tool which not only trims and checks LRAT proofs in both ASCII and binary format but also produces clausal cores and has been tested thoroughly. Our experiments on recent competition benchmarks show that our approach reduces time of proof generation and certification substantially compared to competing approaches using intermediate DRAT or FRAT proofs.

 Reducing Acceptance Marks in Emerson-Lei Automata by QBF Solving

 Authors:  Irfansha Shaik, Maximilian Heisinger, Martina Seidl, and Jaco van de Pol  
  Abstract    
 When using a QBF solver for solving application problems encoded to quantified Boolean formulas (QBFs), mainly two things can potentially go wrong: (1) the solver could be buggy and return a wrong result or (2) the encoding could be incorrect. To ensure the correctness of solvers, sophisticated fuzzing and testing techniques have been presented. To ultimately trust a solving result, solvers have to provide a proof certificate that can be independently checked. Much less attention, however, has been paid to the question how to ensure the correctness of encodings. The validation of QBF encodings is particularly challenging because of the variable dependencies introduced by the quantifiers. In contrast to SAT, the solution of a true QBF is not simply a variable assignment, but a winning strategy. For each existential variable x, a winning strategy provides a function that defines how to set x based on the values of the universal variables that precede x in the quantifier prefix. Winning strategies for false formulas are defined dually. In this paper, we provide a tool for validating encodings using winning strategies and interactive game play with a QBF solver. As the representation of winning strategies can get huge, we also introduce validation based on partial winning strategies. Finally, we employ winning strategies for testing if two different encodings of one problem have the same solutions.

 Combining Cubic Dynamical Solvers with Make/Break Heuristics to Solve SAT   
 Authors:  Anshujit Sharma, Matthew Burns, and Michael C. Huang  
  Abstract    
 Dynamical solvers for combinatorial optimization are usually based on 2superscript{nd} degree polynomial interactions, such as the Ising model. These exhibit high success for problems that map naturally to their formulation. However, SAT requires higher degree of interactions. As such, these quadratic dynamical solvers (QDS) have shown poor solution quality due to excessive auxiliary variables and the resulting increase in search-space complexity. Thus recently, a series of cubic dynamical solver (CDS) models have been proposed for SAT and other problems. We show that such problem-agnostic CDS models still perform poorly on moderate to large problems, thus motivating the need to utilize SAT-specific heuristics. With this insight, our contributions can be summarized into three points. First, we demonstrate that existing make-only heuristics perform poorly on scale-free, industrial-like problems when integrated into CDS. This motivates us to utilize break counts as well. Second, we derive a relationship between make/break and the CDS formulation to efficiently recover break counts. Finally, we utilize this relationship to propose a new make/break heuristic and combine it with a state-of-the-art CDS which is projected to solve SAT problems several orders of magnitude faster than existing software solvers.

 Explaining SAT Solving Using Causal Reasoning   
 Authors:  Jiong Yang, Arijit Shaw, Teodora Baluta, Mate Soos, and Kuldeep S. Meel  
  Abstract    
 The past three decades have witnessed notable success in designing efficient SAT solvers, with modern solvers capable of solving industrial benchmarks containing millions of variables in just a few seconds. The success of modern SAT solvers owes to the widely-used CDCL algorithm, which lacks comprehensive theoretical investigation. Furthermore, it has been observed that CDCL solvers still struggle to deal with specific classes of benchmarks comprising only hundreds of variables, which contrasts with their widespread use in real-world applications. Consequently, there is an urgent need to uncover the inner workings of these seemingly weak yet powerful black boxes. In this paper, we present a first step towards this goal by introducing an approach called {CausalSAT}, which employs causal reasoning to gain insights into the functioning of modern SAT solvers. {CausalSAT} initially generates observational data from the execution of SAT solvers and learns a structured graph representing the causal relationships between the components of a SAT solver. Subsequently, given a query such as whether a clause with low literals blocks distance (LBD) has a higher clause utility, {CausalSAT} calculates the causal effect of LBD on clause utility and provides an answer to the question. We use {CausalSAT} to quantitatively verify hypotheses previously regarded as "rules of thumb" or empirical findings, such as the query above or the notion that clauses with high LBD experience a rapid drop in utility over time. Moreover, {CausalSAT} can address previously unexplored questions, like which branching heuristic leads to greater clause utility in order to study the relationship between branching and clause management. Experimental evaluations using practical benchmarks demonstrate that {CausalSAT} effectively fits the data, verifies four "rules of thumb", and provides answers to three questions closely related to implementing modern solvers.

  Abstract    
 The Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT), an important optimization problem, has a range of applications, including network routing, planning and scheduling, and combinatorial auctions. Among these applications, one usually benefits from having not just one single solution, but k diverse solutions. Motivated by this, we study an extension of MaxSAT, named Diversified Top-k MaxSAT (DTKMS) problem, which is to find k feasible assignments of a given formula such that each assignment satisfies all hard clauses and all of them together satisfy the maximum number of soft clauses. This paper presents a local search algorithm, LS-DTKMS, for DTKMS problem, which exploits novel scoring functions to select variables and assignments. Experiments demonstrate that LS-DTKMS outperforms the top-k MaxSAT based DTKMS solvers and state-of-the-art solvers for diversified top-k clique problem.

 A Comparison of SAT Encodings for Acyclicity of Directed Graphs   
 Authors:  Neng-Fa Zhou, Ruiwei Wang, and Roland H. C. Yap  
  Abstract    
 Many practical applications require synthesizing directed graphs that satisfy the acyclic constraint along with some side constraints. Several methods have been devised for encoding acyclicity of directed graphs into SAT, each of which is based on a cycle-detecting algorithm. The leaf-elimination encoding (LEE) repeatedly eliminates leaves from the graph, and judges the graph to be acyclic if the graph becomes empty at a certain time. The vertex-elimination encoding (VEE) exploits the property that the cyclicity of the resulting graph produced by the vertex-elimination operation entails the cyclicity of the original graph. While VEE is significantly smaller than the transitive-closure encoding for sparse graphs, it generates prohibitively large encodings for large dense graphs. This paper reports on a comparison study of four SAT encodings for acyclicity of directed graphs, namely, LEE using unary encoding for time variables (LEE-u), LEE using binary encoding for time variables (LEE-b), VEE, and a hybrid encoding which combines LEE-b and VEE. The results show that the hybrid encoding significantly outperforms the others.

 Developing Efficient Scientific Gateways for Supercomputer Environments Supported by Deep Learning Models  
 Speaker  : Prof. Carla Osthoff (LNCC)  
 The scientific gateway BioinfoPortal for bioinformatics applications is hosted in the National Laboratory for Scientific Computing (LNCC) and is coupled to the Santos Dumont (SDumont) supercomputer environment. BioinfoPortal offers a catalog of bioinformatics computational software that benefits from the parallel and distributed architecture offered by LNCC. Task submissions consume SDumont nodes shared by other supercomputer users; then, it is required to set the best configuration, defined by the best choice of the number of threads/nodes, to be allocated for every task submission. This talk presents research analysis using Deep Neural Networks to estimate the computational time required to execute bioinformatics software in several scenarios using a pre-configured number of nodes and threads. We aim to demonstrate the computational behavior of software in Bioinfoportal and which computational scenario can be chosen to execute software in SDumont efficiently. Results support that the neural networks can predict the most representative variable and identify the configuration with the lowest computational time. This way, BioinforPortal consuming time can lead to an efficient and green gateway, increasing Santos Dumont Supercomputing execution job throughput and decreasing job execution queue waiting time.

 Machine Learning (ML) area have evolved in the last years due to the development of High Performance Computing (HPC). On the other hand, we also have seen many works for evolving HPC through ML. In this context, we could ask: If the community needs HPC to make huge ML-based models more effective, but this same community also needs ML to empower HPC, which area starts this run? Are they exclusive or can we consider both initiatives? This panel aims to discuss this chicken-egg dilemma.

 2023 IEEE 23rd International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM)

  Keywords:source code analysis,source code transformation,  
  Scope:The International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM 2022) aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working on theory, techniques, and applications that concern analysis and/or manipulation of the source code of software systems. The term "source code" refers to any fully executable description of a software system, such as machine code, (very) high-level languages, and executable graphical representations of systems. The term "analysis" refers to any (semi-)automated procedure that yields insight into source code, while "manipulation" refers to any automated or semi-automated procedure that takes and returns source code. While much attention in the wider software engineering community is directed towards other aspects of systems development and evolution, such as specification, design, and requirements engineering, it is the source code that contains the only precise description of the behavior of a system.

  13th - 15th September, 2022  
 SCA 2022   
 This year, the 21st annual ACM SIGGRAPH / Eurographics Symposium on Computer Animation (SCA), the premier forum for innovations in computer animation and physics-based simulation, will be a hybrid face-to-face and online event. The conference is hosted at Durham University  UK on 13th-15th, September. We encourage attendants to join us physically at Durham for a complete conference experience, while we also allow synchronised online attendance for those who may have travel difficulties.  
 This year, accepted full papers will be published in the journal Computer Graphics Forum  , and accepted short papers will be published in the conference proceedings indexed by ACM and Eurographics. Please refer to our call-for-paper  page for paper submission information.  
 We have prepared an engaging program this year. Apart from the accepted paper presentation, we have included keynotes from speakers around the world, including Professor Steven LaValle from the University of Oulu, Associate Professor Rachel McDonnell from Trinity College Dublin, Professor Niloy J. Mitra from University College London, and Dr Daniel Holden from Epic Games. Regarding local activities, we have included an opening reception, a conference banquet, a closing reception, as well as a social event, giving opportunities for attendants to mingle with each other. Furthermore, apart from the usual breakfasts and tea breaks, we have decided to include onsite lunches for all attendants and offer onsite accommodations, giving them more time to socialize.  
 SCA 2022 has received generous support from the industry and academics. Platinum sponsors include Adobe, Disney Research Studios, and the KAUST Visual Computing Center. Gold sponsors include Google. These extra sponsorships have allowed us to significantly lower the registration fees, facilitating the attendance of research students and early-career researchers. Also, they allow us to introduce multiple travel grants, helping attendants with less travel budget to join SCA physically.  
 Finally, we wish to thank all members of the Organising Committee, the Award Committee and the International Program Committee. Their effort has made SCA 2022 possible - getting the best program with high-quality papers and overcoming the logistic challenges introduced by the pandemic. We hope you find SCA 2022 in Durham/online enjoyable, and we hope you continue to take part in future SCAs!
