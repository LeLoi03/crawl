 Ethicomp  
 As it seems that our world is reopening, we are happy to inform you that Ethicomp is held physically in Turku, Finland, July 26-28, 2022. We are not going to continue with the virtual conference as we see that there is a need for real participation where we can meet each other in person, and this cannot be achieved in a virtual conference. Because of this, if the situation (Covid-19 or other issues) prevents physical meeting, the conference will be postponed to 2023 – not turned to a virtual one anymore.  
 The theme of this Ethicomp is the “ Effectiveness of ICT ethics – How do we help solve ethical problems in the field of ICT?  ” It is easy to pinpoint problems and state that something is ethically problematic. It is much harder to give proper suggestions on how to improve the situation through constructive and executable ideas.  
 So please stay tuned.  
 News

 Deadline extension  Because of requests for an extension of the submission time, the deadline is extended to 31st January 2022.   
 Call for Papers is out now – look for it  The theme of this Ethicomp is the “Effectiveness of ICT ethics – How do we help solve ethical problems in...

 2. Let’s reevaluate cybersecurity best practices  (Shalini Kesar, Southern Utah University, kesar@suu.edu; and Sabina Szymoniak Czestochowa University of Technology, sabina.szymoniak@icis.pcz.pl)  
 Today’s society is becoming more dependent on technology, where organizations and individuals cannot function without smart devices in their daily lives. Nowadays, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Internet of Things (IoT) is playing a key role in defining cybersecurity best practices. For example, AI-powered threat detection, anomaly detection, and automated response systems are becoming more sophisticated in identifying and mitigating cyber threats, as well as identifying threats and vulnerabilities. To manage and minimize these data threats, it is important for organizations to reevaluate their cybersecurity strategies and best practices. This track invites articles that discuss the emerging trends in cybersecurity along with their ethical implications of digital interaction when organizations are developing best practices.  
 3. Ethical challenges of human relations in education in the AI era  (Mario Arias-Oliva, Universidad Complutense de Madrid Mar Souto-Romero, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos de Madrid, mario.arias@ucm.es; Antonio Pérez-Portabella, Universitat Rovira i Virgili Graciela Padilla Castillo, Universidad Complutense de Madrid; antonio. perezportabella@urv.cat)  
 Digital technologies offer numerous benefits to educational relationships, including improved communication, collaboration, and access to resources. However, they also present challenges that educators, students, and policymakers must navigate carefully to ensure positive and equitable outcomes. Teacher-student relationships have changed, with teachers becoming facilitators rather than sole sources of knowledge. While technology improves communication between students, teachers, and parents, it can also affect peer relationships, where online collaboration can lead to reduced face-to-face interaction. Excessive digital communication can diminish empathy and social skills, while virtual communities can foster a sense of belonging in online education. Furthermore, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into education introduces new dimensions to these relationships. AI-powered tutoring systems and chatbots can provide personalized support to students, but they also raise concerns about the role of human educators and the potential loss of human connection in the learning process. This track welcomes submissions that explore the multifaceted impact of digital technologies on education in general, including contributions on digital human relationships in education, such as changes in teacher-student dynamics, peer interactions, mentoring, virtual communities, and the ethical implications of AI in learning environments.  
 4. Gender and Future Digital Technologies  (Shalini Kesar, Southern Utah University, kesar@suu.edu)  
 With emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things, it is important to explore the role of gender, as gender disparity can create barriers to managing and sustaining digital technologies. Diverse perspectives and technological innovation can help overcome challenges to economic growth, productivity, solve complex technological problems, drive innovation, and shape the future of technology across multiple sectors. This track welcomes paper proposals from scholars across all fields, as well as practitioners, policymakers, educators, and others whose work or experiences overlap with this theme.  
 5. The normative challenges of AI literacy  (Ludovica Paseri, UNITO, ludovica.paseri@unito.it; and Ugo Pagallo, UNITO, ugo.pagallo@unito.it)

8. ETRA_0 conference:
❮  ❯    
 University of Tübingen (Hybrid) - May 30-June 2, 2023  
 The 2023 ACM Symposium of Eye Tracking Research & Applications (ETRA) will be a fully hybrid conference held in Tübingen, Germany, and online from May 30 to June 2, 2023. The aim of ETRA is to bring together researchers and practitioners from across fields with the common goal of advancing eye tracking research. Join us in Tübingen or attend ETRA online to see the newest cutting-edge eye-tracking research, participate in co-located workshops, and contribute to exciting discussions about the current controversies and the future potential of eye tracking.
