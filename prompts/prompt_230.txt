 2023 ACM SIGMOD/PODS @Seattle, WA, USA  
 Welcome  
 Welcome to the home of the 2023 ACM SIGMOD/PODS Conference, to be held in the Seattle metropolitan area, Washington, USA, on June 18 - June 23, 2023.  
 The Proceedings.  PACMMOD V1 publication containing peer reviewed research track and industrial papers can be accessed here  . The companion proceeding containing all other contributions can be accessed here  .  
 The Conference.  The annual ACM SIGMOD/PODS Conference is a leading international forum for database researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and results, and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences. The conference includes a fascinating technical program with research and industrial talks, tutorials, demos, and focused workshops. It also hosts a poster session to learn about innovative technology, an industrial exhibition to meet companies and publishers, and a careers-in-industry panel with representatives from leading companies.  
 The Seattle Metropolitan Area.  With everything from unrivaled natural beauty and world-class attractions to major sports teams, a thriving arts and culture scene, and beyond, there’s always something to do in Seattle. Whether you’re looking for budget-friendly finds or on the hunt for the latest Instagram-worthy vista, the Emerald City has you covered. While here, you can meet artisan makers, shop indie boutiques and designer fashions, admire priceless works of art, sing your heart out at a karaoke club, explore like a local in the city’s diverse neighborhoods, and enjoy nature—all without ever having to leave the city. No matter what you’re looking for, the perfect adventure awaits!  
 The Conference Hotel.  The conference will be held in the Hyatt Regency Bellevue  hotel. The conference venue is located on Seattle’s Eastside in the heart of Bellevue’s Shopping, Dining and Entertainment district, The Bellevue Collection. With its small-town charm and big city convenience, Bellevue, Washington is a modern oasis with endless activities and cultural attractions sprinkled in. Located nine miles from downtown Seattle, Hyatt Regency Bellevue connects you to world-class shopping, dining, entertainment, and major corporate headquarters. Visitors will also enjoy the natural beauty and scenery and the abundance of outdoor recreational activities nearby.  
 The Conference Format.  Please refer to Conference Format  for more details about how the conference will be organized.

 Conference Format  
 To have the best experience for all the attendees and facilitate the active discussions and collaborations between presenters and attendees, the 2023 ACM SIGMOD/PODS Conference and all co-located events (such as Workshops, Panels, Tutorials, Demos, Competitions, etc.) will be in-person. Please submit the following information in a single PDF file with your application:  
  Each paper should have at least one author registered for in-person attendance and presentation. At least one author must register for the conference before the camera ready submission deadline, otherwise, the paper will not appear in the proceedings. Please include your CMT paper ID, assigned during the review process, when you register for the conference. 
  If a paper cannot have an in-person presenter, the authors need to provide a valid justification, e.g., travel restrictions from their government or visa application not granted for even one author etc. 
  For a paper that cannot have an in-person presenter (due to a valid justification), the authors are expected to communicate with the respective chairs to submit a pre-recorded video or make alternative presentation arrangements. 
  We plan to record some in-person plenary sessions (e.g., Keynote and Award talks) and make them available at a future date AFTER the conference as part of the ACM digital library. 
  We plan to collect pre-recorded videos for the SIGMOD research papers, industrial papers, and demos which will be made available AFTER the conference as part of the ACM digital library.
