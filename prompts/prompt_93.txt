 FEATURE TOPIC: Enabling the IoT ecosystem through Embedded Wireless Systems and Networks   
 The Internet of Things (IoT) is the latest example of an ecosystem whose constituent elements promise to be independent, situated, and temporarily networked to synergically provide advanced cyber–physical functionalities. Embedded Wireless Systems and Networks play a key role in the IoT scenario but their engineering poses several challenges from as many viewpoints, spanning across the whole development stack: at device level, embedded systems demands to incorporate embedded intelligence for smartness, autonomy, safety, resilience, efficiency and privacy; at network level, current wireless technologies like 5G, NB-IOT, ZigBee and Lora as well as next-generation ones need to be fully exploited aiming to enable edge computing paradigm; at data level, the huge amount of data with heterogeneous data schemas and formats demand for effective processing, storage and exploitation techniques; finally, at the service level, integration and interoperability issues need to be addressed by means of semantic technologies to avoid

 FASE  Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering  
 FASE is an established series of international conferences on Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering with more than 30 years of tradition.   
 Conference Name and History  
 Scope of Interest  
 FASE has a broad scope of interest.  
 As the field of the Software Engineering is broad, the scope of FASE is broad as well, including requirements, design architecture, modeling, refactoring, software transformation, generation and synthesis, test verification, validation, development methods and processes (agile), and so on. Thanks to its origins FASE has been traditionally focused primarily on formal models and methods, often involving reasoning about code, design, and the associated processes. However, these are not the only topics of interest. Agile methods, object-orientation search-based software engineering have been discussed in the past. Crucially, the letter “F” in FASE stands for “fundamental” not formal, and all research asking basic foundational questions about developing software is welcomed.  
 FASE is strongly affected by new developments in the technical landscape: AI and machine learning, security, block chain, quantum computing. FASE will continue to shift its interest along with the needs of the society and the interests of the research community. Wherever we go, we will continue asking what are the principles of developing systems in these areas, and what techniques help to reason about them, supporting new engineering methods and tools.  
 25 Anniversary Celebration  
 In 2022, FASE celebrated its 25 anniversary. Watch the talk of Gabriele Taentzer and Eduard Kamburjan about the conference history!

 Conference Organizers  
 Overview  
 The 21st USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies (FAST '23) brings together storage-system researchers and practitioners to explore new directions in the design, implementation, evaluation, and deployment of storage systems. The program committee interprets "storage systems" broadly: submissions on low-level storage devices, distributed storage systems, and information management are all of interest. The conference will consist of technical presentations including refereed papers, and poster sessions.  
 Topics  
 Topics of interest to FAST should include files and/or storage, and may overlap with other topics including, but not limited to:  
 Archival systems 
  Auditing and provenance 
  Search and data retrieval 
  Security 
  In evaluating the fit of a paper for FAST, a key ingredient is the design of storage software. A paper with only hardware-level contributions will be out-of-scope; a paper could be brought into scope for FAST by demonstrating for example how software can leverage novel hardware.  
 Submission Instructions  
 The complete submission must be no longer than 12 pages excluding references. | There is no short-paper category. | The program committee values conciseness: if you can express an idea in fewer pages than the limit, do so. Supplemental material may be added as a single separate file without page limits. However, the reviewers are not required to read or consider such material. Content that should be considered to judge the paper is not supplemental and counts toward the page limit. 
  Papers must be typeset on U.S. letter-sized pages in two columns using 10-point Times Roman font on 12-point leading (single-spaced), within a text block | 7" wide by 9" deep | . 
  Labels, captions, and other text in figures, graphs, and tables must use font sizes that, when printed, do not require magnification to be legible. References must not be set in a smaller font. Submissions that violate these requirements will not be reviewed. Limits will be interpreted strictly. No extensions will be given for reformatting. 
  A LaTeX template and style file are available on the | USENIX templates page | . 
  Double-blind policy: | Authors must not be identified in the submissions, either explicitly or by implication. To refer to your previous work, consider it as written by a third party. Do not say "reference removed for blind review." Supplemental material must be anonymized. Submissions violating anonymization rules will not be considered for review. If you are uncertain about how to anonymize your submission, please contact the program co-chairs, | fast23chairs@usenix.org | , well in advance of the submission deadline. 
  Prior Workshop Paper Policy: | If a submission extends a prior workshop paper, please include an anonymized copy of the workshop paper in the submission field. This should be the same as the published version, with any identifying information removed. 
  Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty or fraud. USENIX, like other scientific and technical conferences and journals, prohibits these practices and may take action against authors who have committed them. See the | USENIX Conference Submissions Policy | for details. 
  If you are uncertain whether your submission meets USENIX's guidelines, contact the program co-chairs, | fast23chairs@usenix.org | , or the USENIX office, | submissionspolicy@usenix.org | . 
  Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered. 
  Submissions should abide by the Conflict Identification guidelines (see below). 
  The program committee and external reviewers will judge papers on technical merit, significance, relevance, and presentation. Research papers on new and unexplored problems are encouraged. A good research paper:  
 addresses a significant problem; 
  presents an interesting, compelling solution; 
  clearly describes what the authors have done; and 
  clearly articulates the advances beyond previous work. 
  Program committee members, USENIX, and the broader community generally value a paper more highly if it clearly defines and is accompanied by artifacts not previously available. These artifacts may include traces, original data, source code, or tools developed as part of the submitted work.  
 Blind reviewing of all papers will be done by the program committee, assisted by outside referees when necessary. Accepted papers will be shepherded by a member of the program committee.  
  Deployed-Systems Papers  
 In addition to papers that describe original research, FAST '23 also solicits papers that describe real operational systems, including systems currently in production. Such papers should address experience with the practical design, implementation, analysis, deployment, or operation of such systems. We encourage submission of papers that disprove or strengthen existing assumptions, deepen the understanding of existing problems, and validate known techniques in environments in which they were never before used or tested, with preference given to experimental results based on production data. Deployed-system papers will be treated similarly to other papers for publication purposes; they need not present new ideas or results to be accepted, but should offer useful guidance to practitioners.  
 A good deployed-system paper:  
 clearly articulates lessons learned from deploying in production; 
  describes an operational system of broad interest; 
  discusses practical problems encountered in production; and 
  supports the lessons with appropriate evidence, potentially including statistical data from the deployment, empirical evaluation of the system, and anecdotes. 
  For deployed systems papers, the title should be prefixed with "Deployed System: "  , followed by the title. Authors must also indicate in the submission form that they are submitting a deployed-system paper.  
 Double-blind Policy for Deployed-system Paper:  All submissions for FAST '23 are required to follow the double-blind policy (see above). However, for only deployed-system papers, the product or company described in the paper need not be anonymized (authors still need to be anonymized).  
 Author Response Period  
 Conflict Identification  
 Upon submitting your paper, authors must indicate conflicts with PC members. A conflict exists in one of the following cases:  
 Institution:  You are currently employed at the same institution, have been previously employed at the same institution within the past two years, or are going to begin employment at the same institution. A completed internship does not constitute an institutional conflict.  
 Advisor/Advisee:  Doctoral thesis advisor and post-doctoral advisor (if relevant) are conflicts for life.  
 Collaboration:  You have a collaboration on a project, publication, grant proposal, or editorship within the past two years.  
 Close friends and family:  Close family relations (e.g., spouse, parent/child, sibling) and close friends are conflicts forever, if they are potential reviewers.  
 The PC will review paper conflicts to ensure the integrity of the reviewing process, adding conflicts if necessary. If there is no basis for conflicts indicated by authors, such conflicts will be removed. Do not identify PC members as a conflict solely to avoid having them as reviewers. If you have any questions about conflicts, contact the program co-chairs.  
 Author Notification and Beyond  
 Authors will be notified of paper acceptance or rejection according to the schedule above. If your paper is accepted and you need an invitation letter to apply for a visa to attend the conference, contact conference@usenix.org  as soon as possible. Visa applications can take at least 30 working days to process. Identify yourself as a presenter and include your mailing address in your email.  
 Early Rejection Notification.  This year, we will notify authors of papers that are rejected early in the process, prior to the author response period. The goal is to allow authors of early rejected papers to use reviewer feedback earlier and resubmit to another conference as soon as possible. Early rejected papers will no longer be considered under submission (for the purposes of multiple submission policies) upon receipt of a rejection notification.  
 All papers will be available online to registered attendees no earlier than Thursday, January 26, 2023. If your accepted paper should not be published prior to the event, please notify production@usenix.org  . The papers will be available online to everyone beginning on the first day of the main conference, February 21, 2023. Accepted submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication on the USENIX FAST '23 website; rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential.  
 By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it. If the conference registration fee will pose a hardship for the presenter of the accepted paper, please contact conference@usenix.org  .
