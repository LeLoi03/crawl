 General information  
 The CIDR program consists of single-track keynote, paper and demo presentations. There are also evening sessions, including a lively gong show, and plenty of time for interaction among the delegates, who are researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry. CIDR encourages papers about innovative and risky data management system architecture ideas, systems-building experience and insight, resourceful experimental studies, and provocative position statements. Papers are encouraged to present novel approaches to data systems architecture and usage, to inspire discussions on the latest innovative and visionary ideas in the field. Authors are encouraged to submit their best systems work, and are limited to submit at most two papers.

 24-28 July 2023, Batumi, Georgia  
 About CiE 2023  
 The event is the 19th conference organized by CiE (Computability in Europe)  , a European association of mathematicians, logicians, computer scientists, philosophers, physicists and others interested in new developments in computability and their underlying significance for the real world. The conference will be held in hybrid mode.   
 When  
 Monday to Friday  
  24-28 July, 2023  
 Speakers  
 Submissions  
 Conference Topics | The CiE conferences serve as an interdisciplinary forum for research in all aspects of computability, foundations of computer science, logic, and theoretical computer science, as well as the interplay of these areas with practical issues in computer science and with other disciplines such as biology, mathematics, philosophy, or physics. 
  Paper Submission | THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE cordially invites all researchers, European and non-European, to submit their papers in all areas related to the above for presentation at the conference and inclusion in the proceedings of CiE 2023 at EasyChair  .  
 Papers to be considered in the conferences proceedings must be submitted in PDF format, using the LNCS style (see Springer conference proceedings guidelines  ) and must have a maximum of 12 pages, including references but excluding a possible appendix in which one can include proofs and other additional material. Papers building bridges between different parts of the research community are particularly welcome. 
  Informal Presentations | Continuing the tradition of past CiE conferences, we invite researchers to present informal presentations of their recent work. A proposal for an informal presentation must be submitted via EasyChair  , using the LNCS style (see Springer conference proceedings guidelines  ), and be 1 page long; a brief description of the results suffices and an abstract is not required. Informal presentations will not be published in the LNCS conference proceedings. Results presented as informal presentations at CiE 2023 may appear or may have appeared in other conferences with formal proceedings and/or in journals. 
  Important Dates | Article submission deadline: | February 15, 2023 | (AoE) 
  Author notification: | April 20, 2023 
  Camera-ready due: | May 1, 2023
