 Working Group Purpose & Mission   
 Human Systems Integration (HSI) is a transdisciplinary sociotechnical and management approach to systems engineering used to ensure that a system’s technical, organizational, and human elements are appropriately addressed across the whole system lifecycle, service or enterprise system. HSI considers systems in their operational context together with the necessary interactions between and among their human and technological elements to make them work in harmony and cost-effectively, from the early design to disposal.  
 Our mission  is to ensure all design and engineering disciplines include human and socio-technical interaction and integration to enable system performance.  
 Mission:  
 Human Systems Integration (HSI) is a transdisciplinary sociotechnical and management approach to systems engineering used to ensure that a system’s technical, organizational, and human elements are appropriately addressed across the whole system lifecycle, service or enterprise system. HSI considers systems in their operational context together with the necessary interactions between and among their human and technological elements to make them work in harmony and cost-effectively, from the early design to disposal.  
 Our mission  is to ensure all design and engineering disciplines include human and socio-technical interaction and integration to enable system performance.  
 Scope  
 HSI results from the convergence of Human Factors and Ergonomics  , which provides human-centred and organisation-centred evaluation techniques and tools (HCD), Information Technology  (including AI, Human-Computer Interaction, Modeling and Simulation) and System Engineering,  and the Operational Domain  of the System of Interest (Circle 3 in the figure 1).  HSI can be considered as both an enabling process  associating HCD and SE during the whole lifecycle of a system  , and a product  resulting from this process. Due to the breadth of human considerations and impacts that should be considered by a project - depending on its nature, complexity, and application area - HSI consists of a number of perspectives, such as Safety, Usability, Training, etc (see circle 2, on figure 1) These are used to help ensure that no significant human considerations are missed within requirements analysis, design, evaluation and acceptance testing, and risk management. These perspectives are not exhaustive and the degree to which they each apply will vary from project to project.  
 Figure  2  .   HSI emerges from the overlapping of three main  c  i  rcles   : (1) technology, organization, and people    
 within an environment at the heart; (2) examples of HSI perspectives; and (3) contributing disciplines    
 associated with the Operational Domain at stake in the periphery.   
 Goals  
 The HSI WG aims to demonstrate the value of HSI as an integral part of the Systems Engineering effort and to develop associated practices, resources, organizations, and training to support the Systems Engineering community's adoption of HSI.  
 Stay forefront of evolving SE practices to ensure that the presence of humans is integrated into the engineering in order to deliver successful sociotechnical systems across their life cycle. 
  Foster a community of practitioners from the contributing disciplines (System Engineering, Human Factors and Errgonomics, Information Technology, and Operational Domains) and develop a common framework.
