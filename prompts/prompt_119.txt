  IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems  
 The IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems (ACSOS) was founded as a merger of the IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC) and the IEEE International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems (SASO). The goal of the ACSOS is to provide a forum for sharing the latest research results, ideas and experiences in autonomic computing, self-adaptation and self-organization.  
 Large-scale systems of all types, such as data centers, computer clouds, smart cities, cyber-physical systems, sensor networks, and embedded or pervasive environments, are becoming increasingly complex and burdensome for people to manage. The complexity of current and emerging networks, software and services, especially in dealing with dynamics in the environment and problem domain, has led the software engineering, distributed systems and resource management communities to look for inspiration in diverse fields (e.g., complex systems, control theory, artificial intelligence, sociology, and biology) to find new ways of designing and managing such computing systems.  
 In this endeavor, a number of research problems and challenges exist related to engineering systems, networks and services based on principles from autonomic computing, self-adaptation and self-organization. One challenge in self-adaptation is to identify how to change a specific behavior to achieve the desired improvement in a reliable manner. Another challenge is how to predict and control emergent global system behavior resulting from self-organization. To address these challenges, novel modeling techniques are needed that help to understand the mapping from local behavior to global behavior, as well as the inverse relationship. Such models are a key condition for understanding, controlling, and designing emergent behavior in autonomic systems.

  ICAIL'2023 Conference Web site was launched.  
 19th ICAIL - International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law 2023 (ICAIL 2023)  .  
 Organized by  
  Topics  
 We invite submission of original papers on Artificial Intelligence & Law, covering foundations, methods, tools, systems and applications. Topics may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 Argument mining on legal texts 
  Classification and automatic summarization of legal text 
  Smart contracts and application of blockchain in the legal domain 
  Visualization techniques for legal information and data 
  ICAIL is keen to broaden its scope to include topics of growing importance and to establish links to neighboring disciplines. In addition to the regular paper track ICAIL 2023 will feature the following special tracks:  
 (1) a new special cross-disciplinary outreach track on Artificial Intelligence for Empirical Legal Studies  . Legal systems have seen an increasing need to leverage data analysis to inform stakeholders, decision makers, and policy actors. This potential comes with a mandate for credible empirical research, as well as constructive communication, across communities at the intersection of law and data-driven disciplines. The empirical legal studies and AI&Law communities stand to benefit from an exchange of ideas and collaborations around concrete legal use cases, technical approaches, and commitment to using data-driven technology for policy and social good. For this track we invite short and long submissions of original papers on topics including, but not limited to:  
 Use of machine learning and/or knowledge representation techniques as part of statistical analyses of data from the legal domain 
  Tools and best practices for data collection, curation, and statistical experimentation in the legal domain 
  (2) Innovative applications in AI and Law – Applications that fall within any of the core AI & Law topics. P apers in this track will be subject to the same rigorous reviewing process as regular papers, but the emphasis is less on novel scientific contributions, formal frameworks, or results and more on the innovative and novel application of techniques from AI & Law to real world problems and use cases.  
 (3) Legal, ethical, fairness, accountability, and transparency aspects of AI applications in legal practice, access to justice, compliance, and public administration – ICAIL is committed to not only further the state of the art in using AI technology in legal practice, but also about the legal and ethical ramifications of such applications. This track is intended to facilitate this discourse through the inclusion of case studies, reports on regulations efforts, lessons learned from experiments, technical contributions about monitoring and facilitating ethical use of AI in relevant areas, and other topical contributions. Papers in this track will be subject to the same rigorous reviewing process as regular papers.  
 Paper Submission  
 Papers (up to 10 pages including references for long papers, up to 5 pages including references for short papers) should present contributions from relevant topics. To maintain ICAIL’s relevance in the larger rapidly-moving field at the intersection of law and artificial intelligence, all papers must make clear their relation to legal information, reasoning, or processes as well as relation to prior work and novel scientific contribution, as well as contain a satisfying amount of discussion of their findings.  
 Papers on machine learning or data mining should include discussions of the data, methodology, results, and analysis in sufficient depth beyond merely reporting metrics. Submissions focusing on the reproduction, validation, constructive scrutinization, and extension of previously published works, datasets, and benchmarks are strongly encouraged. 
  Papers proposing formal or computational models should provide examples and/or reproducible simulations. Papers on applications should describe the motivations, techniques, implementation, and evaluation. 
  It is highly recommended for all submissions that code and data be published alongside the papers to facilitate reproducibility. Program committee members will be instructed to take data and code sharing into account in their reviews.  
 Submissions should be uploaded in the conference support system Conftool  by the submission deadline. For each submission, it should be indicated whether it belongs in the regular track or one of the special tracks (AI&Law for Empirical Legal Studies or Innovative Applications or Ethical and Legal Issues for AI in Legal Practice) using the facility provided by the submission system.  
 Reviewing will be double blind. Papers submitted for review must not include names and affiliations of the authors and not include an acknowledgments section. Any identifying text in the body of the paper (e.g. citing “our work”) should be removed or rephrased to be non-identifying. These aspects can be added at the camera-ready stage. Therefore, prior to submission of the paper, the authors should first register the paper on the conference support system in order to receive an ID number for the paper. Then, in order to submit the paper the paper should be revised so that the ID number of the paper replaces the names and affiliations of the authors. The references should include published literature relevant to the paper, including previous works of the authors, though care should be taken in the style of writing in order to preserve anonymity. References to code and data intended to be published alongside the papers are to be phrased such that anonymity is preserved.  
 Submitted papers may not be published as open access preprints before acceptance notifications have been sent. Papers that have already been published as preprints at the time of submission for review must be flagged as such in the review system and must not reference the preprint in the paper.  
 Papers submitted not adhering to the page limitation or the anonymity requirements may be rejected without review.   
 Demonstrations  
 A session will be organized for the demonstration of creative, robust, and practical working applications and tools. Where a demonstration is not connected to a submitted paper, a two-page extended abstract about the system should be submitted for review via the conference support system and following the instructions on paper submission. Accepted extended abstracts will be published in the conference proceedings. For those demonstrations that are connected to a paper in the main track, no separate statement about the demonstration need be submitted, but the author(s) should send an email to the Program Chair by the demo submission deadline to register their interest in demonstrating their work at this session.  
 Workshops & Tutorials  
 ICAIL 2023 will include workshops and tutorials on Monday, June 19 and Friday, June 23. Tutorials should cover a broad topic of relevance to the AI and Law community and should have one or more designated organizers/speakers. Workshops are intended for informal discussion and should have one or more designated organizers as well as an organizing and programming committee. Proposals must contain enough information to permit evaluation on the basis of importance, quality, and community interest. Proposals should be 2 to 4 pages and include at least the following information:  
 The workshop or tutorial topic and goals, their significance, and their appropriateness for ICAIL 2023 
  The intended audience, including the research areas from which participants may come, the likely number of participants (with some of their names, if known), and plans for publicizing the workshop 
  Organization of the workshop or tutorial, including the intended format (such as invited talks, presentations, panel discussions or other methods for ensuring an interactive atmosphere) and the expected length (full day or half day) 
  Organizers’ details: a description of the main organizers’ background in the proposed topic; and complete addresses including web pages of all organizers and committee members (if applicable) 
  Proposals for workshops and tutorials can be sent by email to the program chair, Matthias Grabmair  ( matthias.grabmair@tum.de  ) by the submission deadline.  
  Doctoral Consortium  
 ICAIL 2023 will feature a Doctoral Consortium aiming to promote the exchange of ideas from PhD researchers in the area of Artificial Intelligence and Law and to provide them with an opportunity to interact and receive feedback from leading scholars and experts in the field. Details about the consortium’s program and timeline will be published separately from this call for papers.  
 Awards  
 IAAIL has established three different awards, to be presented at the conference banquet.  
 Donald H. Berman Award for Best Student Paper  The best student paper award is in memory of Donald H. Berman, a professor of law at Northeastern University who was a co-founder of the Artificial Intelligence and Law journal. The award consists of a cash gift and free attendance at ICAIL 2023.

 ICAIL Conference 2023 Recap  
 30 juin 2023    
 Between the 19 and 23 June, the Cyberjustice Laboratory attended the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law (ICAIL 2023)   in Braga, Portugal. Our researchers, Hannes Westermann and Jinzhe Tan, contributed to several segments of the conference.  
 Hannes presented his work on JusticeBot, our AI tool providing legal information to laypeople, in the main conference. Both researchers also participated in the “Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Access to Justice” (AI4AJ), where they compared JusticeBot’s information quality with that of ChatGPT and presented the LLMediator, a tool using large language models such as GPT-4 for conflict mediation.  
 In the “Automated Semantic Analysis of Information in Legal Text” (ASAIL)   workshop, they shared their research on automatic suggestions of relevant legal issues to users. Finally, at the doctoral consortium, Tan presented his work on the impact of emotions in the judicial process.  
 We extend our thanks to the organizers for the opportunity to present our work and participate in these valuable discussions on AI and law!
