 IFIP AIAI Community  
 Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations (AIAI conference) started from Toulouse France.   
 Today, its society comprises of hundreds AI experts-enthusiasts, academicians and researchers from all over the globe (Europe, Asia, America and Australia). They are interacting by presenting their scientific achievements or by discussing numerous aspects of AI advances, under the 4th industrial revolution.  
  The AIAI conference now has its own society, consisting of followers who have been attending it for one or two decades in the row, while new members are constantly joining its family.  
  After almost two decades of continuous presence in the literature, the members of the AIAI society, have formed a very strong community under the auspices of the IFIP Working Group 12.5 (AI applications and Innovations). This group is divided in specific scientific subgroups-subcommunities, specializing in timely hot AI areas. Their members are organizing timely annual workshops specific by subject, which are run and attended by AI professionals-scientists who wish to share knowledge, ideas, problems and insights in every AI subdomain.  
 An indicative reference to the communities – societies that have been already formed under the auspices of the AIAI conference, would include (but not limited) the following:  
 • The Community of Mining Humanistic Data (driven by the Ionian University and the University of Patras, Greece).  
 Though the above communities are here to stay, the above list is dynamic, as new Communities devoted to new AI subdomains are joining to this global event every year.  
  Apart from the papers’ presentation, the distinguished members of the AIAI (IFIP WG12.5) society are offering new insights by giving free Tutorials to conference delegates. This adds actual more merit to the event and enhances the benefits of the members of the AIAI community  
  One of the many benefits for the members of these subcommunities is the fact that they bring together scientists, who are interested either in a narrow specific domain or in hot multidisciplinary areas, or in an emerging subject. This can lead to increased connection and awareness of developments.  
  Under the framework of this community, new researchers are encouraged to proceed further to their developments, by receiving best papers awards together with financial awards, or checks provided by Springer to offer them free access to important scientific publications. Moreover, under the guise of noble rivalry, old and young researchers are invited to complete their research and submit their extended paper for review in prestigious scientific journals. Especially for the young researchers of the AIAI community, this is a unique opportunity to publish not only in the springer proceedings which have millions of recent citations, but also in major scientific journals with a high citation rate.

7. AICE_1 conference:
AiCE began over 20 years ago as an organisation that sought to bring a broader focus to computing. Members included engineers, scientists, medical specialists and others who used information and communications technology (ICT) frequently in their professional lives, but would not qualify for membership of a professional ICT society. The conference series [1]   in recent years has focused increasingly on cybersecurity and ethics, whilst still being broad, inviting contributions on a wide variety of ICT ethics.

 2024 ABEN Annual Conference and HDR workshop 
 ABEN ANNUAL CONFERENCE   
 Thank you for attending the 13 th  Annual Australasian Business Ethics Network Conference hosted by Macquarie Business School, Macquarie University in the Sydney city campus.  
 Our hybrid event  offering face-to-face presentations and networking along with the option of online presentations was a wonderful experience for participants; with a engaging and inspiring array of presentations.  
 For specific feedback or questions, please email submissions@aben.org.au

 Conference Themes   
 Our three conference themes can be treated as independent as well as inter-dependent. This is deliberate to ensure sufficient scope and space for debate and dialogue. We welcome broad inter-disciplinary and theoretical/conceptual and empirical contributions; the conference offers a forum through which various ethical and sustainability-oriented challenges in business and society can be discussed.  
 Session Topics  
 In addition to business ethics, corporate social responsibility, and sustainability, the conference invites colleagues and postgraduate students (Masters and PhD) and their topics from a variety of disciplinary areas including, but not limited to, Accounting, Business Education, Economics, Finance, Human Resource Management, Information Systems, International Business, Law, Management, Marketing, and Operations & Supply Chain Management.  
 Sessions can be organised around topics such as but not limited to:  
 Artificial Intelligence (AI); 
 The theme of ‘stakeholders’ is well known and frequently used to understand both converging and competing interests among various individuals and collective actors and institutions. Embracing inclusive stakeholders design, we invite colleagues to focus on exploring the interplay between local, regional, national, and international stakeholders and how they can either dis-able or enable meaningful analyses of problems.  
 The theme of ‘struggles’ recognises that ethics is an inherently political process which often precipitates activism by stakeholders to achieve necessary change and innovation. Contestation emerges over different priorities, goals, and desired outcomes. Change isn’t always accepted or welcome due to existing power relationships that benefit from maintenance of the status quo.  
 The theme of ‘solutions’ highlights that stakeholders and those seeking change often propose normative and prescriptive outcomes to meet contemporary ethical and sustainability challenges. We invite colleagues to explore and discuss, with a focus on process and outcomes, how solutions can be designed and implemented; when do they work, under what circumstances, and in what contexts/settings?  
 Submission requirements   
 Short abstract    
 All submissions to the conference – extended abstracts or full papers – will be peer reviewed.  
 We have received several requests to extend the ABEN Conference Abstract submission date. To ensure you all have enough time and capacity to finalise your work in what we know is a busy teaching period, we decided to  extend the deadlines  for the abstract and full paper submission.
