 ISSTA/ECOOP'23: Welcome to Seattle and logistics  
 Dear ISSTA/ECOOP 2023 participants,  
 We look forward to welcoming you to the joint conference next week.  
 Below are a number of logistical notes as well as guidelines for presenters. (For convenience, this and other communications will appear on the conference website as well.)  
 On behalf of the ISSTA/ECOOP 2023 organizing committee, welcome to Seattle!  
 René Just  
 Light Rail   
 (The two buildings are adjacent, though the street numbers may suggest otherwise.)  
 Registration   
 Please pick up your conference badge and registration package at the registration desk in the Allen Center. Just enter the building through the sliding doors, and the reception desk will be in front of you. The registration desk will be staffed between 8am and 5pm, Monday through Thursday, and between 8am and noon on Friday.  
 Technical Program   
 You can find a program overview and details for the entire week on the ISSTA/ECOOP website  . (The programs on the ISSTA and ECOOP website instances are in sync with the overall program, but provide a view that is tailored to each conference.)  
 Guidelines for presenters   
 In-person presentations:  Presentation slots are 15 minutes (unless differently indicated by your track chair). Please follow the instructions provided to you by your track chair to allow for enough time for Q&A. Please go to your allocated room 15 minutes before the session start time to meet with the Session Chair (see technical program), review the pronunciation of your name, and familiarize yourself with the room and A/V set up, if needed (see Rehearsal and equipment check). You are expected to use your own laptop for presentations, which needs to be connected via HDMI. Some dongles (USB-C) may be available but bring your own adapter if needed. For ISSTA and ECOOP presentations, the A/V system is set up such that it will capture the screen, presenter, and audio, which will be streamed for remote participants via Zoom. Note that you do not need to join a Zoom meeting, simply plug in your device and use the wireless microphone provided. 
  ISSTA-Online presentations:  Presentation slots are 10 minutes. Prepare for 7.5 minutes of presentation and 2.5 minutes of Q&A. You will be required to present via Zoom. Please join the zoom meeting for your online session 15 minutes before the session start time. The zoom meeting details will be shared separately before the main conference. To avoid complications, please install the latest Zoom application on your computer and do not present via a web browser. Make sure your Zoom setup is working properly by running the Zoom audio/video test before joining the call. If your presentation contains any audio, you must enable the sharing of audio when sharing your screen. When you have finished your presentation, please stop sharing your screen and mute your microphone. 
  Rehearsal and equipment check:  We have reserved room G04 for presentation rehearsal and equipment testing. The A/V setup is identical in all conference rooms. If your set up works in G04, it should work everywhere. 
  Need Help?   
 Signs and student volunteers (in purple shirts) will guide you and help you find your way around campus. If you need additional help or support, please let a staff member at the registration desk know or email April and René.  
 Online sessions and Zoom links  
 Dear ISSTA/ECOOP 2023 participants,  
 Below are four meeting links for joining the conference remotely, grouped by conference room. These links are valid for the entire week, and each meeting will start at 10:15am (PDT) on any given day. Please see the online program  for details regarding sessions, rooms, and presentation order.  
 For online presenters   
 Please make sure to virtually join your meeting room 15 minutes prior to the start of your session to connect with your session chair and a student volunteer in the (physical) conference room.  
 For in-person participants   
 All remote presentations are streamed in the physical conference rooms (in the order as listed in the program). In-person participants will be able to ask questions using a wireless microphone and do not need to connect to Zoom.

 Call for Papers  
 ISSTA invites three kinds of submissions. The clear majority of submissions is expected to be “Research Papers”, but submissions that best fit the description of “Experience Papers” or “Replicability Studies” should be submitted as such.  
 Research Papers   
 Authors are invited to submit research papers describing original contributions in testing or analysis of computer software. Papers describing original theoretical or empirical research, new techniques, methods for emerging systems, in-depth case studies, infrastructures of testing and analysis, or tools are welcome.  
 Authors are invited to submit experience papers describing a significant experience in applying software testing and analysis methods or tools and should carefully identify and discuss important lessons learned so that other researchers and/or practitioners can benefit from the experience. Of special interest are experience papers that report on industrial applications of software testing and analysis methods or tools.  
 Replicability Studies   
 ISSTA would like to encourage researchers to replicate results from previous papers. A replicability study must go beyond simply re-implementing an algorithm and/or re-running the artifacts provided by the original paper. It should at the very least apply the approach to new, significantly broadened inputs. Particularly, replicability studies are encouraged to target techniques that previously were evaluated only on proprietary subject programs or inputs. A replicability study should clearly report on results that the authors were able to replicate as well as on aspects of the work that were not replicable. In the latter case, authors are encouraged to make an effort to communicate or collaborate with the original paper’s authors to determine the cause for any observed discrepancies and, if possible, address them (e.g., through minor implementation changes). We explicitly encourage authors to not focus on a single paper/artifact only, but instead to perform a comparative experiment of multiple related approaches.  
 In particular, replicability studies should follow the ACM guidelines on replicability (different team, different experimental setup): The measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team, a different measuring system, in a different location on multiple trials. For computational experiments, this means that an independent group can obtain the same result using artifacts which they develop completely independently. This means that it is also insufficient to focus on reproducibility (i.e., different team, same experimental setup) alone. Replicability Studies will be evaluated according to the following standards:  
 Depth and breadth of experiments 
  Availability of artifacts 
  We expect replicability studies to clearly point out the artifacts the study is built on, and to submit those artifacts to artifact evaluation (see below). Artifacts evaluated positively will be eligible to obtain the prestigious Results Reproduced badge.  
 Dual Submission Deadlines and Major Revisions   
 ISSTA 2023 features two submission deadlines: An early submission deadline (November 10, 2022) and a regular submission deadline (February 16, 2023). The instructions in this call apply to both deadlines. You can choose to submit at either deadline, but only papers submitted to the first deadline may  receive a chance to submit a major revision  of the initial submission to the regular deadline, addressing the reviewer comments. Papers submitted to the regular deadline will be decided using only the traditional paper outcomes of accept or reject.  
 Submission Guidelines   
 Submissions must be original and should not have been published previously or be under consideration for publication while being evaluated for ISSTA. Authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism  and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions  .  
 Research Papers, Experience Papers, and Replicability Studies should be at most 10 pages in length, with at most 2 additional pages for references. Experience papers and replicability studies should clearly specify their category in the paper title upon submission, e.g., “XXX (Experience Paper)”. All authors should use the official “ACM Master article template”, which can be obtained from the ACM Proceedings Template  pages. Latex users should use the “sigconf” option, as well as the “review” (to produce line numbers for easy reference by the reviewers) and “anonymous” (omitting author names) options. To that end, the following Latex code can be placed at the start of the Latex document:  
 \documentclass[sigconf,review, anonymous]{acmart} \acmConference[ISSTA 2023]{ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis}{17-21 July, 2023}{Seattle, USA}   Submit your papers via the HotCRP ISSTA 2023 submission website  .  
 Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Authors will have an opportunity to respond to reviews during a rebuttal period. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation, quality of presentation and appropriate comparison to related work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as the PC chair may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The authors will have a chance to read the additional reviews and respond to them during the additional short response period. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for presentation at the conference.  
 Double-blind Reviewing   
 ISSTA 2023 will conduct double-blind reviewing. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. They should also ensure that any citations to related work by themselves are written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work”.  
 Double-blind reviewing should not hinder the usual communication of results. But, during the review period, please don’t broadcast the work on social media. Also, to the extent possible, consider not publishing preprints of your work during or right before the review period. If the authors have already published a version of their paper to arXiv or similar sites, we request authors to use a different title for their submission, so that author names are not inadvertently disclosed, e.g., via a notification on Google Scholar.  
 Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chair by email.  
 Open Science Policy   
 ISSTA has adopted an open science policy. Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and that empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability.  
 Upon submission, authors are asked to make their data available to the program committee (via upload of anonymized supplemental material or a link to an anonymized private or public repository) or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. While sharing such a repository is not mandatory for submission or acceptance, this information will be passed to the program committee to inform its decision. Furthermore, authors are asked to indicate whether they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance.  
 Authors Take Note:   
 The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

  Ausgezeichnet: SOLA beim ISSTA 2023 
  Awarded: SOLA at ISSTA 2023  
 July 25, 2023 / Dirk Srocke   
 Double award for the Software Lab (SOLA). At the International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA 2023), two papers in which the research group of the Institute of Software Engineering (ISTE) was involved were now honoured.  
  [Picture: Alex Jafari (alex.jafari@aito-services.org)]  
  A bimodal taint analysis called "Fluffy"  
 The paper was written by Yi Wai Chow (during his master's thesis at the University of Stuttgart), Max Schaefer (GitHub) and Prof. Michael Pradel  (University of Stuttgart).  
  Surprising result for WebAssembly call graphs  
 Recognised as an ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Artifact was " That’s a Tough Call: Studying the Challenges of Call Graph Construction for WebAssembly  ". In their work, the researchers seek to better understand those challenges that arise in the static construction of call graphs for WebAssembly. Call graphs are at the core of many interprocedural static analysis and optimization techniques. In detail, twelve challenges are identified and examined on 8,000 real code examples. Surprising result: Four existing methods for static analysis are unreliable, without this having been documented so far.  
 Daniel Lehmann  (University of Stuttgart), Michelle Thalakottur (Northeastern University), Prof. Frank Tip (Northeastern University) and Prof. Michael Pradel  (University of Stuttgart) contributed to the paper.

  DOI 
 The award is given to a paper that has had a significant impact on the ISS community, the broader human-computer interaction community, or the industry. The jury evaluated papers from a number of perspectives, like citations and how they developed over time, which venues and what kinds of papers were citing the work, and the extent of forward-thinking ideas, concepts, or prototypes that would later be adopted widely.

  ACM Interactive Surfaces and Spaces (ISS)  
 Welcome!  
 Interactive Surfaces and Spaces increasingly pervade our everyday life, appearing in various sizes, shapes, and application contexts, offering a rich variety of ways to interact.  
 The ISS steering committee members are looking forward to your contribution and participation at the ISS.  
 Upcoming Event  
 Past Events  
 Call for bids: Hosting future ISS Conferences  
 As a first step before submitting a PDF with your bid, you might want to send us a lightweight expression of interest. If you are interested in hosting ISS we just need you to reply with an e-mail that indicates:  
 Main contact person (at least provisionally), and e-mail. 
  Possible geographical location (no need for detail at the moment—a hotel, city, or region is OK). 
 After your e-mail we will follow up about further details (e.g., putting together an organizing team), selecting dates, etc.  
  Alternatively, you might also send us the complete bid directly as a PDF document with the content as indicated below.  
 In either case, please get back to us by responding to the ACM ISS steering committee ( steering@iss.acm.org  ).  
 Bidding Process for ACM ISS  
 A call for bids for ACM ISS is issued by the SC Chair (typically, in November) and sent to all the members of the ACM ISS Program Committee and the wider ACM ISS community. Bids will continue to be accepted until the venues are decided. We will begin reviewing bids as they are received. As a formal bid, bidders should submit a single PDF document to the SC with the following information:  
 The proposal should address each aspect outlined below (approx. 5-6 pages). A PDF document providing further details on the content of the bid can be found here  .  Based on the merits of the proposals and when the proposals are submitted, the committee will choose the top candidates and then a finalist will be chosen and announced.   
 Location  
 Since ISS is an international forum, we expect that attendees travel from different parts of the world to the conference location. It is important that the proposed location is conveniently located for all attendees to reach by available means of transportation. Learning from experiences during the worldwide pandemic, we appreciate the inclusion of concepts for running hybrid conferences.  
 Time  
 ISS conferences have been held at various times during around early / mid November. Your bid should include a proposed time within that range with key dates (e.g., paper submission and notification). The choice of time should also take into account the weather conditions of the proposed location to avoid potential weather-caused travel delays and potential conflicts with other conferences and their submission deadlines (e.g., CHI, CSCW and most importantly UIST).  
 Venue  
 ISS officially includes four days with the workshops and tutorials on its first day, which need to be hosted in separate rooms (10-20 people) in parallel. To encourage interaction among the attendees, during the main conference, it is also desirable to have additional space at the venue to put up ISS posters for the attendees to visit during coffee breaks.  
 Accommodation & Travel Costs  
 Most attendees will travel by plane and need accommodation during the conference period. One of the responsibilities of the conference hosts/organizers is to locate and reserve a bulk of affordable lodging for attendees. Please describe the proposed accommodation options, including the price range of the hotel rooms and the distance to the main venue and approximate travel costs, at the time of the conference from major centres in Europe, US, Asia/Pacific.  
 Provisionary Budget Plan  
 Hosts/Organizers  
 Conference hosts/organizers should have knowledge of the ISS community (e.g., having attended and published regularly at ISS) and have experience with conference organization. One of the main ISS goals is to bring together people from diverse backgrounds. So ensuring the diversity of the organizing committee is highly encouraged and preferred. Please include short bios of the key hosts/organizers and roles of individuals, including the conference chair(s). Note that ISS uses the PACM HCI journal model of publishing, so Track Chairs are selected separately and are involved in the editorial process across multiple years, though we welcome suggestions.  
 The SC will attempt to balance the location of accepted bids to reflect the interests , diversity and geographical location of the community.  
 Mission Statement  
 The ACM Interactive Surfaces and Spaces (ISS) Steering Committee promotes and maintains the ACM ISS conference as the premiere venue for researchers and practitioners interested in the design, development and use of new and emerging tabletop, digital surface, and multi-surface technologies as well as interactive spaces.  
 Contact  
 For any questions or early expressions of interest for hosting a future conference please send an email to the following address:  
 Steering Committee | (steering@iss.acm.org) 
 Structure and People  
 The steering committee (SC) consists of six (6) to eight (8) long-time ISS community members who have strong engagement with the ISS community and have been invited to serve on the committee. Members normally serve on the SC for five (5) years. The SC is lead by a Chair, who is elected by the SC. An outgoing Chair may also advise the Chair to help with knowledge transfer. The SC should represent the diversity of the ISS community.  
 Current Steering Committee Members  
 Tasks and Duties  
 Steering Committee Responsibilities  
 The ISS Steering committee is responsible for:  
 soliciting bids for people interested in organizing a future ISS conference and continuity of the conference, 
  making the decision on where the ISS conference is held every year, 
  providing advice to and communicating with each year's ISS conference chairs, 
  developing the spirit and general direction of ISS and specifically the financial sustainability, the publication model and diversity of the conference. 
  ensuring the highest quality for the program of the conference, 
  promoting the ISS conference series to academia, industry and the public, 
  participating in the 10-year best paper selection process, 
  interfacing to ACM SIGCHI and other HCI sister conferences. 
 Steering Committee Duties  
 Members of the SC are expected to attend the annual ACM ISS Steering Committee meeting during the annual conference (in person ideally but via video conference in lieu of this). In addition SC members are expected to take part in the three-monthly video conferences. A member of the SC is expected to be actively involved in the conference series which can include, attending the annual conference, submitting papers, organising workshops, running tutorials, contributing to the SC discussion and decision process and attending SC meetings.  
 Membership  
 How to become an ACM ISS SC member?  
 The SC will invite future members, by choosing among the past general and program chairs of the ISS conference and people involved in ACM ISS over several years. The SC is expected to have less than 8 members and more than 6. People will drop of the SC after a maximum period of 5 years. Membership of a SC member terminates when (s)he is frequently inactive. Along with participation, the SC mailing list serves as an archive of members' activities and should be reported on by the chair of the SC at the start of each annual steering committee meeting.  
 Steering Committee Chair  
 SC Decision Process  
 Any SC member can raise an issue by sending an e-mail to the list of all SC members. Every SC member must reply to the mail on the list, describing her/his position within 10 days. If no consensus is apparent, the chair calls for a formal vote (Plurality voting) by email. Every SC member must reply sending her/his vote on the list within a week. A SC member is conflicted with voting for a bid to host a conference, if the SC member is general or program chair of the proposed bid. The member can talk part in the discussion, but it not allowed to vote.
