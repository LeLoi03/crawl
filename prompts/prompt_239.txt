 17th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems  
 Singapore, 18th-22nd September 2023  
 The ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys) is the premier international forum for the presentation of new research results, systems and techniques in the broad field of recommender systems. RecSys brings together the major international research groups working on recommender systems, along with many of the world’s leading companies active in e-commerce and other adjacent domains. It has become the most important annual conference for the presentation and discussion of recommender systems research. RecSys 2023, the seventeenth conference in this series, will be held in Singapore. It will bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to present their latest results and identify new trends and challenges in providing recommendation components in a range of innovative application contexts. In addition to the main technical track, the RecSys 2023 program will feature keynote and invited talks, tutorials covering state-of-the-art in this domain, a workshop program, an industrial track and a doctoral symposium.  
 Statement on Inclusion and Safety  
 As the organizers of RecSys 2023, we are committed to providing an inclusive, safe, and respectful conference environment for all attendees. As we increasingly realize the impact of our community’s work on society, we appreciate now more than ever the importance of providing an inclusive and accessible conference that brings together a diverse recommender systems community.  
  As an ACM conference, RecSys and its organizers, speakers, and attendees are bound by the ACM Policy Against Discrimination and Harassment  , which applies to both the conference venue and social media. As organizers, this is a policy that we fully endorse.  
  RecSys has made efforts over the last several years to be an accessible and inclusive community, across various perspectives, and we have sought throughout our planning of RecSys 2023 to continue and expand those efforts. The General Chairs (Shlomo Berkovsky, Li Chen and Jie Zhang) welcome your input  
 Accessibility and Inclusion at RecSys.  The RecSys conference values and cares about diversity, accessibility and inclusion. We have always been diverse in terms of disciplinary backgrounds (e.g. including both HCI- and data-focused work), professional affiliations (e.g. strong representation from both academia and industry), and application domains of our work. We are aware that members in our community may come from historically underrepresented groups, for which we wish to pro-actively encourage and support increased participation. To ensure the conference and its activities are accessible to all, we also explicitly seek to address the visible or invisible support needs members of our community may have.  
 Publications and Presentations.  RecSys hosts a variety of scientific discussions. Historically, we have prepared guidelines for accessible and inclusive presentations. We would like to emphasize that inclusive, safe and respectful addressing does not only apply to conference presentations, but also to the whole process leading towards these presentations, including the way in which research is presented and reviewed. We therefore would like to encourage our community members to already keep our best practice guidelines on inclusive language in mind, when preparing their manuscripts and peer reviewing.  
 Contact.  Should you experience or witness a violation of the anti-harassment policy, or have any other concerns regarding your ability to fully and safely participate in the conference, please email the RecSys General Chairs; you can also directly reach them at the conference venue.  
 We hope you have an amazing RecSys.

 RES  A Lightweight Method for Modeling Confidence in Recommendations with Learned Beta Distributions  
  by Norman Knyazev (Radboud University) and Harrie Oosterhuis (Radboud University). | Most recommender systems (RecSys) do not provide an indication of confidence in their decisions. Therefore, they do not distinguish between recommendations of which they are certain, and those where they are not. Existing confidence methods for RecSys are either inaccurate heuristics, conceptually complex or very computationally expensive. Consequently, real-world RecSys applications rarely adopt these methods, and thus, provide no confidence insights in their behavior. In this work, we propose learned beta distributions (LBD) as a simple and practical recommendation method with an explicit measure of confidence. Our main insight is that beta distributions predict user preferences as probability distributions that naturally model confidence on a closed interval, yet can be implemented with the minimal model-complexity. Our results show that LBD maintains competitive accuracy to existing methods while also having a significantly stronger correlation between its accuracy and confidence. Furthermore, LBD has higher performance when applied to a high-precision targeted recommendation task. Our work thus shows that confidence in RecSys is possible without sacrificing simplicity or accuracy, and without introducing heavy computational complexity. Thereby, we hope it enables better insight into real-world RecSys and opens the door for novel future applications.

  RES  A Multi-view Graph Contrastive Learning Framework for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation  
  by Zitao Xu (Shenzhen University), Weike Pan (Shenzhen University) and Zhong Ming (Shenzhen University). | Sequential recommendation methods play an irreplaceable role in recommender systems which can capture the users’ dynamic preferences from the behavior sequences. Despite their success, these works usually suffer from the sparsity problem commonly existed in real applications. Cross-domain sequential recommendation aims to alleviate this problem by introducing relatively richer source-domain data. However, most existing methods capture the users’ preferences independently of each domain, which may neglect the item transition patterns across sequences from different domains, i.e., a user’s interaction in one domain may influence his/her next interaction in other domains. Moreover, the data sparsity problem still exists since some items in the target and source domains are interacted with only a limited number of times. To address these issues, in this paper we propose a generic framework named multi-view graph contrastive learning (MGCL). Specifically, we adopt the contrastive mechanism in an intra-domain item representation view and an inter-domain user preference view. The former is to jointly learn the dynamic sequential information in the user sequence graph and the static collaborative information in the cross-domain global graph, while the latter is to capture the complementary information of the user’s preferences from different domains. Extensive empirical studies on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our MGCL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

  RES  Adversarial Collaborative Filtering for Free  
  by Huiyuan Chen (Visa Research), Xiaoting Li (Visa Research), Vivian Lai (Visa Research), Chin-Chia Michael Yeh (Visa Research), Yujie Fan (Visa Research), Yan Zheng (Visa Research), Mahashweta Das (Visa Research) and Hao Yang (Visa Research). | Collaborative Filtering (CF) has been successfully applied to help users discover the items of interest. Nevertheless, existing CF methods suffer from noisy data issue, which negatively impacts the quality of personalized recommendation. To tackle this problem, many prior studies leverage the adversarial learning principle to regularize the representations of users and items, which has shown great ability in improving both generalizability and robustness. Generally, those methods learn adversarial perturbations and model parameters using min-max optimization framework. However, there still have two major limitations: 1) Existing methods lack theoretical guarantees of why adding perturbations improve the model generalizability and robustness since noisy data is naturally different from adversarial attacks; 2) Solving min-max optimization is time-consuming. In addition to updating the model parameters, each iteration requires additional computations to update the perturbations, making them not scalable for industry-scale datasets.  
 In this paper, we present Sharpness-aware Matrix Factorization (SharpMF), a simple yet effective method that conducts adversarial training without extra computational cost over the base optimizer. To achieve this goal, we first revisit the existing adversarial collaborative filtering and discuss its connection with recent Sharpness-aware Minimization. This analysis shows that adversarial training actually seeks model parameters that lie in neighborhoods having uniformly low loss values, resulting in better generalizability. To reduce the computational overhead, SharpMF introduces a novel trajectory loss to measure sharpness between current weights and past weights. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our SharpMF achieves superior performance with almost zero additional computational cost comparing to adversarial training.

  RES  Alleviating the Long-Tail Problem in Conversational Recommender Systems  
  by Zhipeng Zhao (Singapore Management University), Kun Zhou (School of Information, Renmin University of China), Xiaolei Wang (Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China), Wayne Xin Zhao (Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China), Fan Pan (Poisson Lab, Huawei), Zhao Cao (Poisson Lab, Huawei) and Ji-Rong Wen (Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China). | Conversational recommender systems (CRS) aim to provide the recommendation service via natural language conversations. To develop an effective CRS, high-quality CRS datasets are very crucial. However, existing CRS datasets suffer from the long-tail issue, \ie a large proportion of items are rarely (or even never) mentioned in the conversations, which are called long-tail items. As a result, the CRSs trained on these datasets tend to recommend frequent items, and the diversity of the recommended items would be largely reduced, making users easier to get bored.  
 To address this issue, this paper presents \textbf{LOT-CRS}, a novel framework that focuses on simulating and utilizing a balanced CRS dataset (\ie covering all the items evenly) for improving \textbf{LO}ng-\textbf{T}ail recommendation performance of CRSs. In our approach, we design two pre-training tasks to enhance the understanding of simulated conversation for long-tail items, and adopt retrieval-augmented fine-tuning with label smoothness strategy to further improve the recommendation of long-tail items. Extensive experiments on two public CRS datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness and extensibility of our approach, especially on long-tail recommendation. All the experimental codes will be released after the review period.

  RES  Augmented Negative Sampling for Collaborative Filtering  
  by Yuhan Zhao (Harbin Engineering University), Rui Chen (Harbin Engineering University), Riwei Lai (Harbin Engineering University), Qilong Han (Harbin Engineering University), Hongtao Song (Harbin Engineering University) and Li Chen (Hong Kong Baptist University). | Negative sampling is essential for implicit-feedback-based collaborative filtering, which is used to constitute negative signals from massive unlabeled data to guide supervised learning. The state-of-the-art idea is to utilize hard negative samples that carry more useful information to form a better decision boundary. To balance efficiency and effectiveness, the vast majority of existing methods follow the two-pass approach, in which the first pass samples a fixed number of unobserved items by a simple static distribution and then the second pass selects the final negative items using a more sophisticated negative sampling strategy. However, selecting negative samples from the original items from a dataset is inherently limited due to the limited available choices, and thus may not be able to contrast positive samples well. In this paper, we confirm this observation via carefully designed experiments and introduce two major limitations of existing solutions: ambiguous trap and information discrimination.

  RES  AutoOpt: Automatic Hyperparameter Scheduling and Optimization for Deep Click-through Rate Prediction  
  by Yujun Li (Noah’s Ark Lab), Xing Tang (Noah’s Ark Lab), Bo Chen (Noah’s Ark Lab), Yimin Huang (Noah’s Ark Lab), Ruiming Tang (Noah’s Ark Lab) and Zhenguo Li (Noah’s Ark Lab). | Click-through Rate (CTR) prediction is essential for commercial recommender systems. Recently, to improve the prediction accuracy, plenty of deep learning-based CTR models have been proposed, which are sensitive to hyperparameters and difficult to optimize well. General hyperparameter optimization methods fix these hyperparameters across the entire model training and repeat them multiple times. This trial-and-error process not only leads to suboptimal performance but also requires non-trivial computation efforts. In this paper, we propose an automatic hyperparameters scheduling and optimization method for deep CTR models, \emph{AutoOpt}, making the optimization process more stable and efficient. Specifically, the whole training regime is firstly divided into several consecutive stages, where a data-efficient model is learned to model the relation between model states and prediction performance. To optimize the stage-wise hyperparameters, AutoOpt uses the \textit{global} and \textit{local} scheduling modules to propose proper hyperparameters for the next stage based on the training in the current stage. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks are conducted to validate the effectiveness of AutoOpt. Moreover, AutoOpt has been deployed onto an advertising platform and a music platform, where online A/B tests also demonstrate superior improvement.

  RES  Data-free Knowledge Distillation for Reusing Recommendation Models  
  by Cheng Wang (Huazhong University of Science and Technology), Jiacheng Sun (Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab), Zhenhua Dong (Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab), Jieming Zhu (Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab), Zhenguo Li (Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab), Ruixuan Li (Huazhong University of Science and Technology) and Rui Zhang (ruizhang.info). | A common practice to keep the freshness of an offline Recommender System (RS) is to train models that fit the user’s most recent behaviours while directly replacing the outdated historical model. However, many feature engineering and computing resources are used to train these historical models, but they are underutilized in the downstream RS model training. In this paper, to turn these historical models into treasures, we introduce a model inversed data synthesis framework, which can recover training data information from the historical model and use it for knowledge transfer. This framework synthesizes a new form of data from the historical model. Specifically, we ‘invert’ an off-the-shield pretrained model to synthesize binary class user-item pairs beginning from random noise without requiring any additional information from the training dataset. To synthesize new data from a pretrained model, we update the input from random float initialization rather than one- or multi-hot vectors. An additional statistical regularization is added to further improve the quality of the synthetic data inverted from the deep model with batch normalization. The experimental results show that our framework can generalize across different types of models. We can efficiently train different types of classical Click-Through-Rate (CTR) prediction models from scratch with significantly few inversed synthetic data (2 orders of magnitude). Moreover, our framework can also work well in the knowledge transfer scenarios such as continual updating and data-free knowledge distillation.

  RES  Disentangling Motives behind Item Consumption and Social Connection for Mutually-enhanced Joint Prediction  
  by Youchen Sun (Nanyang Technological University), Zhu Sun (A*STAR), Xiao Sha (Nanyang Technological University), Jie Zhang (Nanyang Technological University) and Yew Soon Ong (Nanyang Technological University). | Item consumption and social connection, as common user behaviors in many web applications, have been extensively studied. However, most current works separately perform either item or social link prediction tasks, possibly with the help of the other as an auxiliary signal. Moreover, they merely consider the behaviors in a holistic manner yet neglect the multi-faceted motives behind them (e.g., watching movies to kill time or with friends; connecting with others due to friendships or colleagues). To fill the gap, we propose to disentangle the multi-faceted motives in each network, defined respectively by the two types of behaviors, for mutually- enhanced joint prediction (DMJP). Specifically, we first learn the disentangled user representations driven by motives of multi-facets in both networks. Thereafter, the mutual influence of the two networks is subtly discriminated at the facet-to-facet level. The fine-grained mutual influence, proven to be asymmetric, is then exploited to help refine user representations in both networks, with the goal of achieving a mutually-enhanced joint item and social link prediction. Empirical studies on three public datasets showcase the superiority of DMJP against state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on both tasks.

  RES  Distribution-based Learnable Filters with Side Information for Sequential Recommendation  
  by Haibo Liu (School of Cyber Security and Computer, HeBei university), Zhixiang Deng (School of Cyber Security and Computer, HeBei university), Liang Wang (School of Cyber Security and Computer, HeBei university), Jinjia Peng (School of Cyber Security and Computer, HeBei university) and Shi Feng (School of Computer Science & Engineering, Northeastern University). | Sequential Recommendation aims to predict the next item by mining out the dynamic preference from user previous interactions. However, most methods represent each item as a single fixed vector, which is incapable of capturing the uncertainty of item-item transitions that result from time-dependent and multifarious interests of users. Besides, they fail to effectively exploit side information that helps to better express user preferences. At last, the noise in user’s access sequence, which is due to accidental clicks, can interfere with the next item prediction and lead to lower recommendation performance. To deal with these issues, we propose DLFS-Rec, a novel model that combines Distribution-based Learnable Filters with Side information for sequential Recommendation. Specifically, items and their side information are represented by stochastic Gaussian distribution, which is described by mean and covariance embeddings, and then the corresponding embeddings are fused to generate a final representation for each item. To attenuate noise, stacked learnable filter layers are applied to smooth the fused embeddings. The similarities between the distributions inferred from the last filter layer and candidates are measured by 2-Wasserstein distance for generating recommendation list. Extensive experiments on four public real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over state-of-the-art baselines, especially on cold start users and items.

  RES  Equivariant Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation  
  by Peilin Zhou (HKUST (Guangzhou)), Jingqi Gao (Upstage), Yueqi Xie (HKUST), Qichen Ye (Peking University), Yining Hua (Harvard Medical School), Jaeboum Kim (The University of Hong Kong Science and Technology, Upstage), Shoujin Wang (Data Science Institute, University of Technology Sydney) and Sunghun Kim (The University of Hong Kong Science and Technology). | Contrastive learning (CL) benefits the training of sequential recommendation models with informative self-supervision signals. Existing solutions apply general sequential data augmentation strategies to generate positive pairs and encourage their representations to be invariant. However, due to the inherent properties of user behavior sequences, some augmentation strategies, such as item substitution, can lead to changes in user intent. Learning indiscriminately invariant representations for all augmentation strategies might be sub-optimal. Therefore, we propose Equivariant Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation (ECL-SR), which endows SR models with great discriminative power, making the learned user behavior representations sensitive to invasive augmentations (e.g., item substitution) and insensitive to mild augmentations (e.g., feature-level dropout masking). In detail, we use the conditional discriminator to capture differences in behavior due to item substitution, which encourages the user behavior encoder to be equivariant to invasive augmentations. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that the proposed ECL-SR framework achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art SR models. The source code will be released.

  RES  Fast and Examination-agnostic Reciprocal Recommendation in Matching Markets  
  by Yoji Tomita (CyberAgent, Inc.), Riku Togashi (CyberAgent, Inc.), Yuriko Hashizume (CyberAgent, Inc.) and Naoto Ohsaka (CyberAgent, Inc.). | n matching markets such as job posting and online dating platforms, the recommender system plays a critical role in the success of the platform. Unlike standard recommender systems that suggest items to users, reciprocal recommender systems (RRSs) that suggest other users must take into account the mutual interests of users. In addition, ensuring that recommendation opportunities do not disproportionately favor popular users is essential for the total number of matches and for fairness among users. Existing recommendation methods in matching markets, however, face computational challenges on large-scale platforms and depend on specific examination functions in the position-based model (PBM). In this paper, we introduce the reciprocal recommendation method based on the matching with transferable utility (TU matching) model in the context of ranking recommendations in matching markets and propose a fast and examination-model-free algorithm. Furthermore, we evaluate our approach on experiments with synthetic data and real-world data from an online dating platform in Japan. Our method performs better than or as well as existing methods in terms of the number of total matches and works well even in a large-scale dataset for which one existing method does not work.

  by Zhi Zheng (University of Science and Technology of China), Ying Sun (The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)), Xin Song (Baidu), Hengshu Zhu (BOSS Zhipin) and Hui Xiong (The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)). | With the rapid development of enterprise Learning Management Systems (LMS), more and more companies are trying to build enterprise training and course learning platforms for promoting the career development of employees. Indeed, through course learning, many employees have the opportunity to improve their knowledge and skills. For these systems, a major issue is how to recommend learning plans, i.e., a set of courses arranged in the order they should be learned, that can help employees improve their work performance. Existing studies mainly focus on recommending courses that users are most likely to click on by capturing their learning preferences. However, the learning preference of employees may not be the right fit for their career development, and thus it may not necessarily mean their work performance can be improved accordingly. Furthermore, how to capture the mutual correlation and sequential effects between courses, and ensure the rationality of the generated results, is also a major challenge. To this end, in this paper, we propose the Generative Learning plAn recommenDation (GLAD) framework, which can generate personalized learning plans for employees to help them improve their work performance. Specifically, we first design a performance predictor and a rationality discriminator, which have the same transformer-based model architecture, but with totally different parameters and functionalities. In particular, the performance predictor is trained for predicting the work performance of employees based on their work profiles and historical learning records, while the rationality discriminator aims to evaluate the rationality of the generated results. Then, we design a learning plan generator based on the gated transformer and the cross-attention mechanism for learning plan generation. We calculate the weighted sum of the output from the performance predictor and the rationality discriminator as the reward, and we use Self-Critical Sequence Training (SCST) based policy gradient methods to train the generator following the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) paradigm. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world data clearly validate the effectiveness of our GLAD framework compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods and reveal some interesting findings for talent management

  RES  Gradient Matching for Categorical Data Distillation in CTR Prediction  
  by Cheng Wang (School of Cyber Science and Engineering,Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan), Jiacheng Sun (Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab), Zhenhua Dong (Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab), Ruixuan Li (School of Computer Science and Technology,Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan) and Rui Zhang (ruizhang.info). | The cost of hardware and energy consumption on training a click-through rate (CTR) model is highly prohibitive. A recent promising direction for reducing such costs is data distillation with gradient matching, which aims to synthesize a small distilled dataset to guide the model to a similar parameter space as those trained on real data. However, there are two main challenges to implementing such a method in the recommendation field: (1) The categorical recommended data are high dimensional and sparse one- or multi-hot data which will block the gradient flow, causing backpropagation-based data distillation invalid. (2) The data distillation process with gradient matching is computationally expensive due to the bi-level optimization. To this end, we investigate efficient data distillation tailored for recommendation data with plenty of side information where we formulate the discrete data to the dense and continuous data format. Then, we further introduce a one-step gradient matching scheme, which performs gradient matching for only a single step to overcome the inefficient training process. The overall proposed method is called Categorical data distillation with Gradient Matching (CGM), which is capable of distilling a large dataset into a small of informative synthetic data for training CTR models from scratch. Experimental results show that our proposed method not only outperforms the state-of-the-art coreset selection and data distillation methods but also has remarkable cross-architecture performance. Moreover, we explore the application of CGM on continual updating and mitigate the effect of different random seeds on the training results.

  RES  Incentivizing Exploration in Linear Contextual Bandits under Information Gap  
  by Huazheng Wang (Oregon State University), Haifeng Xu (University of Chicago), Chuanhao Li (University of Virginia), Zhiyuan Liu (University of colorado,boulder) and Hongning Wang (University of Virginia). | Contextual bandit algorithms have been popularly used to address interactive recommendation, where the users are assumed to be cooperative to explore all recommendations from a system. In this paper, we relax this strong assumption and study the problem of incentivized exploration with myopic users, where the users are only interested in recommendations with their currently highest estimated reward. As a result, in order to obtain long-term optimality, the system needs to offer compensation to incentivize the users to take the exploratory recommendations. We consider a new and practically motivated setting where the context features employed by the user are more \emph{informative} than those used by the system: for example, features based on users’ private information are not accessible by the system. We develop an effective solution for incentivized exploration under such an information gap, and prove that the method achieves a sublinear rate in both regret and compensation. We theoretically and empirically analyze the added compensation due to the information gap, compared with the case where the system has access to the same context features as the user does, i.e., without information gap. Moreover, we also provide a compensation lower bound of this problem.

  RES  InTune: Reinforcement Learning-based Data Pipeline Optimization for Deep Recommendation Models  
  by Kabir Nagrecha (University of California, San Diego), Lingyi Liu (Netflix, Inc.), Pablo Delgado (Netflix, Inc.) and Prasanna Padmanabhan (Netflix, Inc.). | Deep learning-based recommendation models (DLRMs) have become an essential component of many modern recommender systems. Several companies are now building large compute clusters reserved only for DLRM training, driving new interest in cost- & time- saving optimizations. The systems challenges faced in this setting are unique; while typical deep learning (DL) training jobs are dominated by model execution times, the most important factor in DLRM training performance is often online data ingestion.  
 In this paper, we explore the unique characteristics of this data ingestion problem and provide insights into the specific bottlenecks and challenges of the DLRM training pipeline at scale. We study real-world DLRM data processing pipelines taken from our compute cluster to both observe the performance impacts of online ingestion and to identify shortfalls in existing data pipeline optimizers. We find that current tooling either yields sub-optimal performance, frequent crashes, or else requires impractical cluster re-organization to adopt. Our studies lead us to design and build a new solution for data pipeline optimization, InTune. InTune employs a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to learn how to distribute CPU resources across a DLRM data pipeline to more effectively parallelize data-loading and improve throughput. Our experiments show that InTune can build an optimized data pipeline configuration within only a few minutes, and can easily be integrated into existing training workflows. By exploiting the responsiveness and adaptability of RL, InTune achieves significantly higher online data ingestion rates than existing optimizers, thus reducing idle times in model execution and increasing efficiency. We apply InTune to our real-world cluster, and find that it increases data ingestion throughput by as much as 2.29X versus current state-of-the-art data pipeline optimizers while also improving both CPU & GPU utilization.

  by Alberto Carlo Maria Mancino (Politecnico di Bari), Antonio Ferrara (Politecnico di Bari), Salvatore Bufi (Polytechnic University of Bari), Daniele Malitesta (Polytechnic University of Bari), Tommaso Di Noia (Polytechnic University of Bari) and Eugenio Di Sciascio (Polytechnic University of Bari). | Knowledge graphs (KG) have been proven to be a powerful source of side information to enhance the performance of recommendation algorithms. Their graph-based structure paves the way for the adoption of graph-aware learning models such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this respect, state-of-the-art models achieve good performance and interpretability via user-level combinations of intents leading users to their choices. Unfortunately, such results often come from and end-to-end learnings that considers a combination of the whole set of features contained in the KG without any analysis of the user decisions. In this paper, we introduce KGTORe, a GNN-based model that exploits KG to learn latent representations for the semantic features, and consequently, interpret the user decisions as a personal distillation of the item feature representations. Differently from previous models, KGTORe does not need to process the whole KG at training time but relies on a selection of the most discriminative features for the users, thus resulting in improved performance and personalization. Experimental results on three well-known datasets show that KGTORe achieves remarkable accuracy performance and several ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of its components.

  RES  Multi-Relational Contrastive Learning for Recommendation  
  by Wei Wei (University of Hong Kong), Lianghao Xia (University of Hong Kong) and Chao Huang (University of Hong Kong). | Dynamic behavior modeling has become a crucial task for personalized recommender systems that aim to learn users’ time-evolving preferences on online platforms. However, many recommendation models rely on a single type of behavior learning, which significantly limits their ability to represent user-item relationships in real-life applications where interactions between users and items often come in multiple types (e.g., click, tag-as-favorite, review, and purchase). To offer better recommendations, this paper proposes the Evolving Graph Contrastive Memory Network (EGCM) to model dynamic interaction heterogeneity. Firstly, we develop a multi-relational graph encoder to capture short-term preference heterogeneity and preserve the dedicated relation semantics for different types of user-item interactions. Additionally, we design a dynamic cross-relational memory network that enables EGCM to capture users’ long-term multi-behavior preferences and the underlying evolving cross-type behavior dependencies over time. To obtain robust and informative user representations with both commonality and diversity across multi-behavior interactions, we design a multi-relational contrastive learning paradigm with heterogeneous short- and long-term interest modeling. We further provide theoretical analyses to support the modeling of commonality and diversity from the perspective of enhancing model optimization. Experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our recommender system over various state-of-the-art baselines.

  by Xinyang Yi (Google), Shao-Chuan Wang (Google), Ruining He (Google), Hariharan Chandrasekaran (Google), Charles Wu (Google), Lukasz Heldt (Google), Lichan Hong (Google), Minmin Chen (Google) and Ed Chi (Google). | The last decade has witnessed many successes of deep learning-based models for industry-scale recommender systems. These models are typically trained offline in a batch manner. While being effective in capturing users’ past interactions with recommendation platforms, batch learning suffers from long model-update latency and is vulnerable to system biases, making it hard to adapt to distribution shift and explore new items or user interests. Although online learning-based approaches (e.g., multi-armed bandits) have demonstrated promising theoretical results in tackling these challenges, their practical real-time implementation in large-scale recommender systems remains limited. First, the scalability of online approaches in servicing a massive online traffic while ensuring timely updates of bandit parameters poses a significant challenge. Additionally, exploring uncertainty in recommender systems can easily result in unfavorable user experience, highlighting the need for devising intricate strategies that effectively balance the trade-off between exploitation and exploration. In this paper, we introduce \textsl{Online Matching}: a scalable closed-loop bandit system learning from users’ direct feedback on items in real time. We present a hybrid \textsl{offline + online} approach for constructing this system, accompanied by a comprehensive exposition of the end-to-end system architecture. We propose Diag-LinUCB — a novel extension of the LinUCB algorithm — to enable distributed updates of bandits parameter in a scalable and timely manner. We conduct live experiments in YouTube and show that Online Matching is able to enhance the capabilities of fresh content discovery and item exploration in the present platform.

  RES  Task Aware Feature Extraction Framework for Sequential Dependence Multi-Task Learning  
  by Xuewen Tao (Mybank, Ant Group), Mingming Ha (School of Automation and Electrical Engineering, University of Science and Technology Bejing; Mybank, Ant Group), Qiongxu Ma (Mybank, Ant Group), Hongwei Cheng (Mybank, Ant Group), Wenfang Lin (Mybank, Ant Group) and Xiaobo Guo (Institute of Information Science, Beijing Jiaotong Univeristy; Mybank, Ant Group). | In online recommendation, financial service, etc., the most common application of multi-task learning (MTL) is the multi-step conversion estimations. A core property of the multi-step conversion is the sequential dependence among tasks. Most existing works focus far more on the specific post-view click-through rate (CTR) and post-click conversion rate (CVR) estimations, which neglect the generalization of sequential dependence multi-task learning (SDMTL). Besides, the performance of the SDMTL framework is also deteriorated by the interference derived from implicitly conflict information passing between adjacent tasks. In this paper, a systematic learning paradigm of the SDMTL problem is established for the first time, which can transform the SDMTL problem into a general MTL problem and be applicable to more general multi-step conversion scenarios with longer conversion path or stronger task dependence. Also, the distribution dependence between adjacent task spaces is illustrated from a theoretical point of view. On the other hand, an SDMTL architecture, named Task Aware Feature Extraction (TAFE), is developed to enable dynamic task representation learning from a sample-wise view. TAFE selectively reconstructs the implicit shared information corresponding to each sample case and performs explicit task-specific extraction under dependence constraints. Extensive experiments on offline public and real-world industrial datasets, and online A/B implementations demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of proposed theoretical and implementation frameworks.

Though widely useful, such ‘trending now‘ carousels typically generate item lists based on simple heuristics, e.g., the number of interactions within a time interval, and therefore still leave much room for improvement. This paper aims to systematically study this under-explored but important problem from the new perspective of time series forecasting. We first provide a set of rigorous definitions related to item trendiness with associated evaluation protocols, and then propose a deep latent variable model, dubbed Trend Recommender (TrendRec), to forecast items’ future trend and generate trending item lists. Experiments on real-world datasets from various domains show that our TrendRec significantly outperforms the baselines, verifying our model’s effectiveness.

While recent years have witnessed many promising fairness aware recommender models, an important problem has been largely ignored, that is, the fairness can be biased due to the user personalized selection tendencies or the non-uniform item exposure probabilities. To study this problem, in this paper, we formally define a novel task named as unbiased fairness aware Top-N recommendation. For solving this task, we firstly define an ideal loss function based on all the user-item pairs. Considering that, in real-world datasets, only a small number of user-item interactions can be observed, we then approximate the above ideal loss with a more tractable objective based on the inverse propensity score (IPS). Since the recommendation datasets can be noisy and quite sparse, which brings difficulties for accurately estimating the IPS, we propose to optimize the objective in an IPS range instead of a specific point, which improve the model fault tolerance capability. In order to make our model more applicable to the commonly studied Top-N recommendation, we soften the ranking metrics such as Precision, Hit-Ratio and NDCG to derive an fully differentiable framework. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model based on four real-world datasets.

 RES  A Probabilistic Position Bias Model for Short-Video Recommendation Feeds  
  by Olivier Jeunen (ShareChat UK). | Modern web-based platforms often show ranked lists of recommendations to users, in an attempt to maximise user satisfaction or business metrics. Typically, the goal of such systems boils down to maximising the exposure probability — conversely, minimising the rank— for items that are deemed “reward-maximising” according to some metric of interest. This general framing comprises music or movie streaming applications, as well as e-commerce, restaurant or job recommendations, and even web search. Position bias or user models can be used to estimate exposure probabilities for each use-case, specifically tailored to how users interact with the presented rankings. A unifying factor in these diverse problem settings is that typically only one or several items will be engaged with (clicked, streamed, purchased, et cetera) before a user leaves the ranked list. Short-video feeds on social media platforms diverge from this general framing in several ways, most notably that users do not tend to leave the feed after, for example, liking a post. Indeed, seemingly infinite feeds invite users to scroll further down the ranked list. For this reason, existing position bias or user models tend to fall short in such settings, as they do not accurately capture users’ interaction modalities. In this work, we propose a novel and probabilistically sound personalised position bias model for feed recommendations. We focus on a 1st-level feed in a hierarchical structure, where users may enter a 2nd-level feed via any given 1st-level item. We posit that users come to the platform with a given scrolling budget that is drawn according to a discrete power-law distribution, and show how the survival function of said distribution can be used to obtain closed-form estimates for personalised exposure probabilities. Empirical insights gained through data from a large-scale social media platform show how our probabilistic position bias model more accurately captures empirical exposure than existing models, and paves the way for improved unbiased evaluation and learning-to-rank.

  RES  ADRNet: A Generalized Collaborative Filtering Framework Combining Clinical and Non-Clinical Data for Adverse Drug Reaction Prediction  
  by Haoxuan Li (Center for Data Science, Peking University), Taojun Hu (Peking University), Zetong Xiong (Zhongnan University of Economic and Law), Chunyuan Zheng (University of California, San Diego), Fuli Feng (University of Science and Technology of China), Xiangnan He (University of Science and Technology of China) and Xiao-Hua Zhou (Peking University). | Adverse drug reaction (ADR) prediction plays a crucial role in both health care and drug discovery for reducing patient mortality and enhancing drug safety. Recently, many studies have been devoted to effectively predict the drug-ADRs incidence rates. However, these methods either did not effectively utilize non-clinical data, i.e., physical, chemical, and biological information about the drug, or did little to establish a link between content-based and pure collaborative filtering during the training phase. In this paper, we first formulate the prediction of multi-label ADRs as a drug-ADR collaborative filtering problem, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide extensive benchmark results of previous collaborative filtering methods on two large publicly available clinical datasets. Then, by exploiting the easy accessible drug characteristics from non-clinical data, we propose ADRNet, a generalized collaborative filtering framework combining clinical and non-clinical data for drug-ADR prediction. Specifically, ADRNet has a shallow collaborative filtering module and a deep drug representation module, which can exploit the high-dimensional drug descriptors to further guide the learning of low-dimensional ADR latent embeddings, which incorporates both the benefits of collaborative filtering and representation learning. Extensive experiments are conducted on two publicly available real-world drug-ADR clinical datasets and two non-clinical datasets to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed ADRNet.

  RES  Using Learnable Physics for Real-Time Exercise Form Recommendations  
  by Abhishek Jaiswal (Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur), Gautam Chauhan (Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur) and Nisheeth Srivastava (Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur). | Good posture and form are essential for safe and productive exercising. Even in gym settings, trainers may not be readily available for feedback. Rehabilitation therapies and fitness workouts can thus benefit from recommender systems that provide real-time evaluation. In this paper, we present an algorithmic pipeline that can diagnose problems in exercises technique and offer corrective recommendations, with high sensitivity and specificity, in real-time. We use MediaPipe for pose recognition, count repetitions using peak-prominence detection, and use a learnable physics simulator to track motion evolution for each exercise. A test video is diagnosed based on deviations from the prototypical learned motion using statistical learning. The system is evaluated on six full and upper body exercises. These real-time interactive suggestions counseled via low-cost equipment like smartphones will allow exercisers to rectify potential mistakes making self-practice feasible while reducing the risk of workout injuries.

  RES  Analysis Operations for Constraint-based Recommender Systems  
  by Sebastian Lubos (Institute of Software Technology – Graz University of Technology), Viet-Man Le (Graz University of Technology), Alexander Felfernig (TU Graz) and Thi Ngoc Trang Tran (Graz University of Technology). | Constraint-based recommender systems support users in the identification of complex items such as financial services and digital cameras. Such recommender systems enable users to find an appropriate item within the scope of a conversational process. In this context, relevant items are determined by matching user preferences with a corresponding product (item) assortment on the basis of a pre-defined set of constraints. The development and maintenance of constraint-based recommenders is often an error-prone activity – specifically with regard to the scoping of the offered item assortment. In this paper, we propose a set of offline analysis operations that provide insights to assess the quality of a constraint-based recommender system before the system is deployed for productive use. The operations include a.o. automated analysis of feature restrictiveness and item (product) accessibility. We analyze usage scenarios of the proposed analysis operations on the basis of a simplified example digital camera recommender.

  RES  Beyond the Sequence: Statistics-driven Pre-training for Stabilizing Sequential Recommendation Model  
  by Sirui Wang (Meituan Group), Peiguang Li (Meituan Group), Yunsen Xian (Meituan Group) and Hongzhi Zhang (Meituan Group). | The sequential recommendation task aims to predict the item that user is interested in according to his/her historical action sequence. However, inevitable random action, i.e. user randomly accesses an item among multiple candidates or clicks several items at random order, cause the sequence fails to provide stable and high-quality signals. To alleviate the issue, we propose the StatisTics-Driven Pre-traing framework (called STDP briefly). The main idea of the work lies in the exploration of utilizing the statistics information along with the pre-training paradigm to stabilize the optimization of recommendation model. Specifically, we derive two types of statistical information: item co-occurrence across sequence and attribute frequency within the sequence. And we design the following pre-training tasks: 1) The co-occurred items prediction task, which encourages the model to distribute its attention on multiple suitable targets instead of just focusing on the next item that may be unstable. 2) We generate a paired sequence by replacing items with their co-occurred items and enforce its representation close with the original one, thus enhancing the model’s robustness to the random noise. 3) To reduce the impact of random on user’s long-term preferences, we encourage the model to capture sequence-level frequent attributes. The significant improvement over six datasets demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of the proposal, and further analysis verified the generalization of the STDP framework on other models.

One of the most highly acclaimed shallow autoencoders is EASE, favored for its competitive recommendation accuracy and simultaneous simplicity. However, the poor scalability of EASE (both in time and especially in memory) severely restricts its use in production environments with vast item sets. In this paper, we propose a hyperefficient factorization technique for sparse approximate inversion of the data-Gram matrix used in EASE. The resulting autoencoder, SANSA, is an end-to-end sparse solution with prescribable density and almost arbitrarily low memory requirements (even for training). As such, SANSA allows us to effortlessly scale the concept of EASE to millions of items and beyond.

  RES  M3REC: A Meta-based Multi-scenario Multi-task Recommendation Framework  
  by Zerong Lan (Dalian University of Technology), Yingyi Zhang (Dalian University of technology) and Xianneng Li (Dalian University of Technology). | Users in recommender systems exhibit multi-behavior in multiple business scenarios on real-world e-commerce platforms. A crucial challenge in such systems is to make recommendations for each business scenario at the same time. On top of this, multiple predictions (e.g., Click Through Rate and Conversion Rate) need to be made simultaneously in order to improve the platform revenue. Research focus on making recommendations for several business scenarios is in the field of Multi-Scenario Recommendation (MSR), and Multi-Task Recommendation (MTR) mainly attempts to solve the possible problems in collaboratively executing different recommendation tasks. However, existing researchers have paid attention to either MSR or MTR, ignoring the integration of MSR and MTR that faces the issue of conflict between scenarios and tasks. To address the above issue, we propose a Meta-based Multi-scenario Multi-task RECommendation framework (M3REC) to serve multiple tasks in multiple business scenarios by a unified model. However, integrating MSR and MTR in a proper manner is non-trivial due to: 1) Unified representation problem: Users’ and items’ representation behave Non-i.i.d in different scenarios and tasks which takes inconsistency into recommendations. 2) Synchronous optimization problem: Tasks distribution varies in different scenarios, and a unified optimization method is needed to optimize multi-tasks in multi-scenarios. Thus, to unified represent users and items, we design a Meta-Item-Embedding Generator (MIEG) and a User-Preference Transformer (UPT). The MIEG module can generate initialized item embedding using item features through meta-learning technology, and the UPT module can transfer user preferences in other scenarios. Besides, the M3REC framework uses a specifically designed backbone network together with a task-specific aggregate gate to promote all tasks to achieve the purpose of optimizing multiple tasks in multiple business scenarios within one model. Experiments on two public datasets have shown that M3REC outperforms those compared MSR and MTR state-of-the-art methods.

  by Lucien Heitz (University of Zurich), Juliane A. Lischka (University of Hamburg), Rana Abdullah (University of Hamburg), Laura Laugwitz (University of Hamburg), Hendrik Meyer (University of Hamburg) and Abraham Bernstein (University of Zurich). | News recommender systems are an increasingly popular field of study that attracts a growing, interdisciplinary research community. As these systems play an important role in our daily lives, the mechanisms behind their curation processes are under close scrutiny. In the domain of personalized news, many platforms make design choices that are driven by economic incentives. In contrast to such systems that optimize for financial gains, there exists norm-driven diversity objectives, putting normative and democratic goals first. Their impact on users, however, in terms of triggering behavioral changes or affecting knowledgeability, is still under-researched. In this paper, we contribute to the field of news recommender system design by conducting a user study that looks at the impact of these normative approaches. We a.) operationalize the notion of deliberative democracy for news recommendations, show b.) the impact on political knowledgeability and c.) the influence on voting behavior. We found that exposure to small parties is associated with an increase in knowledge about their candidates and that intensive news consumption about a party can change the direction of attitudes towards their issues.

This paper investigates the relevance of such a practice. For this purpose, we propose an expected precision score, designed to measure the consistency of an average embedding relative to the items used for its construction. We subsequently analyze the mathematical expression of this score in a theoretical setting with specific assumptions, as well as its empirical behavior on real-world data from music streaming services. Our results emphasize that real-world averages are less consistent for recommendation, which paves the way for future research to better align real-world embeddings with assumptions from our theoretical setting.

  by Balázs Hidasi (Gravity R&D, a Taboola company) and Ádám Tibor Czapp (Gravity R&D, a Taboola company). | Even though offline evaluation is just an imperfect proxy of online performance — due to the interactive nature of recommenders — it will probably remain the primary way of evaluation in recommender systems research for the foreseeable future, since the proprietary nature of production recommenders prevents independent validation of A/B test setups and verification of online results. Therefore, it is imperative that offline evaluation setups are as realistic and as flawless as they can be. Unfortunately, evaluation flaws are quite common in recommenders systems research nowadays, due to later works copying flawed evaluation setups from their predecessors without questioning their validity. In the hope of improving the quality of offline evaluation of recommender systems, we discuss four of these widespread flaws and why researchers should avoid them.

  by Giuseppe Spillo (University of Bari), Allegra De Filippo (University of Bologna), Cataldo Musto (Dipartimento di Informatica – University of Bari), Michela Milano (University of Bologna) and Giovanni Semeraro (University of Bari). | In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of the trade-off between the performance of state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms and their sustainability. In particular, we compared 18 popular recommendation algorithms in terms of both standard metrics (i.e., accuracy and diversity of the recommendations) as well as in terms of energy consumption and carbon footprint on three different datasets. In order to obtain a fair comparison, all the algorithms were run based on the implementations available in a popular recommendation library, i.e., RecBole, and used the same experimental settings. The outcomes of the experiments clearly showed that the choice of the optimal recommendation algorithm requires a thorough analysis, since more sophisticated algorithms often led to tiny improvements at the cost of an exponential increase of carbon emissions. Through this paper, we aim to shed light on the problem of carbon footprint and energy consumption of recommender systems, and we make the first step towards the development of sustainability-aware recommendation algorithms.

However, the common case where the value function is a parameterized function taking state and action as input results in a linearly increasing number of evaluations required to select an action, proportional to the number of candidate items. While slow training may be acceptable, this becomes intractable when considering the costly evaluation of the parameterized function, such as with deep neural networks, during model serving time. To address this issue, we propose an actor-based policy that reduces the evaluation of the Q-function to a subset of items, significantly reducing inference time and enabling practical deployment in real-world industrial settings. In our empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves equivalent user session engagement to a value-based policy, while significantly reducing the slate serving time by at least 4 times.

  RES  Looks Can Be Deceiving: Linking User-Item Interactions and User’s Propensity Towards Multi-Objective Recommendations  
  by Patrik Dokoupil (Department of Software Engineering, Charles University), Ladislav Peska (Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University, Prague, Czechia) and Ludovico Boratto (University of Cagliari). | Multi-objective recommender systems (MORS) provide suggestions to users according to multiple (and possibly conflicting) goals. When a system optimizes its results at the individual-user level, it tailors them on a user’s propensity towards the different objectives. Hence, the capability to understand users’ fine-grained needs towards each goal is crucial. In this paper, we present the results of a user study in which we monitored the way users interacted with recommended items, as well as their self-proclaimed propensities towards relevance, novelty and diversity objectives. The study was divided into several sessions, where users evaluated recommendation lists originating from a relevance-only single-objective baseline as well as MORS. We show that despite MORS-based recommendations attracted less selections, its presence in the early sessions is crucial for users’ satisfaction in the later stages. Surprisingly, the self-proclaimed willingness of users to interact with novel and diverse items is not always reflected in the recommendations they accept. Post-study questionnaires provide insights on how to deal with this matter, suggesting that MORS-based results should be accompanied by elements that allow users to understand the recommendations, so as to facilitate their acceptance.

  RES  Ti-DC-GNN: Incorporating Time-Interval Dual Graphs for Recommender Systems  
  by Nikita Severin (HSE University), Andrey Savchenko (Sber AI Lab), Dmitrii Kiselev (Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (AIRI)), Maria Ivanova (Sber AI Lab), Ivan Kireev (Sber AI Lab) and Ilya Makarov (Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (AIRI)). | Recommender systems are essential for personalized content delivery and have become increasingly popular in recent years. However, traditional recommender systems are limited in their ability to capture complex relationships between users and items. Recently, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a promising solution for improving recommender systems by incorporating temporal and sequential information in dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel method, “Ti-DC-GNN” (Time-Interval Dual Causal Graph Neural Networks), based on an intermediate representation of graph evolution as a sequence of time-interval graphs. The main parts of the method are the novel forms of interval graphs: graph of causality and graph of consequence that explicitly preserve inter-relationships between edges (user-items interactions). The local and global message passing are developed based on edge memory to identify both short-term and long-term dependencies. Experiments on several well-known datasets show that our method consistently outperforms modern temporal GNNs with node memory alone in dynamic edge prediction tasks.

  RES  Of Spiky SVDs and Music Recommendation  
  by Darius Afchar (Deezer Research), Romain Hennequin (Deezer Research) and Vincent Guigue (AgroParisTech). | The truncated singular value decomposition is a widely used methodology in music recommendation for direct similar-item retrieval or embedding musical items for downstream tasks. This paper investigates a curious effect that we show naturally occurring on many recommendation datasets: spiking formations in the embedding space. We first propose a metric to quantify this spiking organization’s strength, then mathematically prove its origin tied to underlying communities of items of varying internal popularity. With this new-found theoretical understanding, we finally open the topic with an industrial use case of estimating how music embeddings’ top-k similar items will change over time under the addition of data.

  RES  Stability of Explainable Recommendation  
  by Sairamvinay Vijayaraghavan (Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis) and Prasant Mohapatra (Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis). | Explainable Recommendation has been gaining attention over the last few years in industry and academia. Explanations provided along with recommendations for each user in a recommender system framework have many uses: particularly reasoning why a suggestion is provided and how well an item aligns with a user’s personalized preferences. Hence, explanations can play a huge role in influencing users to purchase products. However, the reliability of the explanations under varying scenarios has not been strictly verified in an empirical perspective. Unreliable explanations can bear strong consequences such as attackers leveraging explanations for manipulating and tempting users to purchase target items: that the attackers would want to promote. In this paper, we study the vulnerability of existent feature-oriented explainable recommenders, particularly analyzing their performance under different levels of external noises added into model parameters. We conducted experiments by analyzing three important state-of-the-art explainable recommenders when trained on two widely used e-commerce based recommendation datasets of different scales. We observe that all the explainable models are vulnerable to increased noise levels. Experimental results verify our hypothesis that the ability to explain recommendations does decrease along with increasing noise levels and particularly adversarial noise does contribute to a much stronger decrease. Our study presents an empirical verification on the topic of robust explanations in recommender systems which can be extended to different types of explainable recommenders in RS.

  by Aleksey Romanov (National Research University Higher School of Economics), Oleg Lashinin (Tinkoff), Marina Ananyeva (National Research University Higher School of Economics) and Sergey Kolesnikov (Tinkoff.AI). | In this paper we study the next basket recommendation problem. Recent methods use different approaches to achieve better performance. However, many of them do not use information about the time of prediction and time intervals between baskets. To fill this gap, we propose a novel method, Time-Aware Item-based Weighting (TAIW), which takes timestamps and intervals into account. We provide experiments on three real-world datasets, and TAIW outperforms well-tuned state-of-the-art baselines for next-basket recommendations. In addition, we show the results of an ablation study and a case study of a few items.

  REP  Everyone’s a Winner! On Hyperparameter Tuning of Recommendation Models  
  by Faisal Shehzad (University of Klagenfurt) and Dietmar Jannach (University of Klagenfurt) | The performance of a recommender system algorithm in terms of common offline accuracy measures often strongly depends on the chosen hyperparameters. Therefore, when comparing algorithms in offline experiments, we can obtain reliable insights regarding the effectiveness of a newly proposed algorithm only if we compare it to a number of state-of-the-art baselines that are carefully tuned for each of the considered datasets. While this fundamental principle of any area of applied machine learning is undisputed, we find that the tuning process for the baselines in the current literature is barely documented in much of today’s published research. Ultimately, in case the baselines are actually not carefully tuned, progress may remain unclear. In this paper, we showcase how every method in such an unsound comparison can be reported to be outperforming the state-of-the-art. Finally, we iterate appropriate research practices to avoid unreliable algorithm comparisons in the future.

  REP  HUMMUS: A Linked, Healthiness-Aware, User-centered and Argument-Enabling Recipe Data Set for Recommendation  
  by Felix Bölz (INSA Lyon & University of Passau), Diana Nurbakova (INSA Lyon), Sylvie Calabretto (INSA Lyon), Armin Gerl (University of Passau), Lionel Brunie (INSA Lyon) and Harald Kosch (University of Passau) | The overweight and obesity rate is increasing for decades worldwide. Healthy nutrition is, besides education and physical activity, one of the various keys to tackle this issue. In an effort to increase the availability of digital, healthy recommendations, the scientific area of food recommendation extends its focus from the accuracy of the recommendations to beyond-accuracy goals like transparency and healthiness. To address this issue a data basis is required, which in the ideal case encompasses user-item interactions like ratings and reviews, food-related information like recipe details, nutritional data, and in the best case additional data which describes the food items and their relations semantically. Though several recipe recommendation data sets exist, to the best of our knowledge, a holistic large-scale healthiness-aware and connected data sets have not been made available yet. The lack of such data could partially explain the poor popularity of the topic of healthy food recommendation when compared to the domain of movie recommendation. In this paper, we show that taking into account only user-item interactions is not sufficient for a recommendation. To close this gap, we propose a connected data set called HUMMUS (Health-aware User-centered recoMMedation and argUment enabling data Set) collected from Food.com containing multiple features including rich nutrient information, text reviews, and ratings, enriched by the authors with extra features such as Nutri-scores and connections to semantic data like the FoodKG and the FoodOn ontology. We hope that these data will contribute to the healthy food recommendation domain.

This concerns several research areas, and recommender systems are witnessing the same reproducibility crisis. Even solid works published at prestigious venues might not be reproducible for several reasons: data might not be public, source code for recommendation algorithms might not be available or well documented, and evaluation metrics might be computed using parameters not explicitly provided. In addition, recommendation pipelines are becoming increasingly complex due to the use of deep neural architectures or representations for multimodal side information involving text, images, audio, or video. This makes the reproducibility of experiments even more challenging. In this work, we describe an extension of an already existing open-source recommendation framework, called ClayRS, with the aim of providing the foundation for future reproducibility of recommendation processes involving images as side information. This extension, called ClayRS Can See, is the starting point for reproducing state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms exploiting images. We have provided our implementation of one of these algorithms, namely VBPR – Visual Bayesian Personalized Ranking from Implicit Feedback, and we have discussed all the issues related to the reproducibility of the study to deeply understand the main traps and pitfalls, along with solutions to deal with such complex environments. We conclude the work by proposing a checklist for recommender systems reproducibility as a guide for the research community.

  LBR  An Exploration of Sentence-Pair Classification for Algorithmic Recruiting  
  by Mesut Kaya (Aalborg University Copenhagen) and Toine Bogers (IT University of Copenhagen). | Recent years have seen a rapid increase in the application of computational approaches to different HR tasks, such as algorithmic hiring, skill extraction, and monitoring of employee satisfaction. Much of the recent work on estimating the fit between a person and a job has used representation learning to represent both resumes and job vacancies computationally and determine the degree to which they match. A common approach to this task is Sentence-BERT, which uses a Siamese network to encode resumes and job descriptions into fixed-length vectors and estimates how well they match based on the similarity between those vectors. In our paper, we adapt BERT’s next-sentence prediction task—predicting whether one sentence is likely to follow another in a given context—to the task of matching resumes with job descriptions. Using historical data on past (mis)matches between job-resume pairs, we fine-tune BERT for this downstream task. Through a combination of offline and online experiments on data from a large Scandinavian job portal, we show that this approach performs significantly better than Sentence-BERT and other state-of-the-art approaches for determining person-job fit.

  LBR  Analyzing Accuracy versus Diversity in a Health Recommender System for Physical Activities: a Longitudinal User Study  
  by Ine Coppens (WAVES – imec – Ghent University), Luc Martens (WAVES – imec – Ghent University) and Toon De Pessemier (WAVES – imec – Ghent University). | As personalization has great potential to improve mobile health apps, analyzing the effect of different recommender algorithms in the health domain is still in its infancy. As such, this paper investigates whether more accurate recommendations from a content-based recommender or more diverse recommendations from a user-based collaborative filtering recommender will lead to more motivation to move. An eight-week longitudinal between-subject user study is being conducted with an Android app in which participants receive personalized recommendations for physical activities and tips to reduce sedentary behavior. The objective manipulation check confirmed that the group with collaborative filtering received significantly more diverse recommendations. The subjective manipulation check showed that the content-based group assigned more positive feedback for perceived accuracy and star rating to the recommendations they chose and executed. However, perceived diversity and inspiringness was significantly higher in the content-based group, suggesting that users might experience the recommendations differently. Lastly, momentary motivation for the executed activities and tips was significantly higher in the content-based group. As such, the preliminary results of this longitudinal study suggest that more accurate and less diverse recommendations have better effects on motivating users to move more.

  LBR  Evaluating The Effects of Calibrated Popularity Bias Mitigation: A Field Study  
  by Anastasiia Klimashevskaia (MediaFutures, University of Bergen), Mehdi Elahi (MediaFutures, University of Bergen), Dietmar Jannach (University of Klagenfurt), Lars Skjærven (TV 2), Astrid Tessem (TV 2) and Christoph Trattner (MediaFutures, University of Bergen). | Despite their proven various benefits, Recommender Systems can cause or amplify certain undesired effects. In this paper, we focus on Popularity Bias, i.e., the tendency of a recommender system to utilize the effect of recommending popular items to the user. Prior research has studied the negative impact of this type of bias on individuals and society as a whole and proposed various approaches to mitigate this in various domains. However, almost all works adopted offline methodologies to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Unfortunately, such offline simulations can potentially be rather simplified and unable to capture the full picture. To contribute to this line of research and given a particular lack of knowledge about how debiasing approaches work not only offline, but online as well, we present in this paper the results of user study on a national broadcaster movie streaming platform in [country]1, i.e., [platform], following the A/B testing methodology. We deployed an effective mitigation approach for popularity bias, called Calibrated Popularity (CP), and monitored its performance in comparison to the platform’s existing collaborative filtering recommendation approach as a baseline over a period of almost four months. The results obtained from a large user base interacting in real-time with the recommendations indicate that the evaluated debiasing approach can be effective in addressing popularity bias while still maintaining the level of user interest and engagement

  LBR  How Users Ride the Carousel: Exploring the Design of Multi-List Recommender Interfaces From a User Perspective  
  by Benedikt Loepp (University of Duisburg-Essen) and Jürgen Ziegler (University of Duisburg-Essen). | Multi-list interfaces are widely used in recommender systems, especially in industry, showing collections of recommendations, one below the other, with items that have certain commonalities. The composition and order of these “carousels” are usually optimized by simulating user interaction based on probabilistic models learned from item click data. Research that actually involves users is rare, with only few studies investigating general user experience in comparison to conventional recommendation lists. Hence, it is largely unknown how specific design aspects such as carousel type and length influence the individual perception and usage of carousel-based interfaces. This paper seeks to fill this gap through an exploratory user study. The results confirm previous assumptions about user behavior and provide first insights into the differences in decision making in the presence of multiple recommendation carousels.

 DEM  EasyStudy: Framework for Easy Deployment of User Studies on Recommender Systems  
  by Patrik Dokoupil (Department of Software Engineering, Charles University) and Ladislav Peska (Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University, Prague, Czechia). | Improvements in the recommender systems (RS) domain are not possible without a thorough way to evaluate and compare newly proposed approaches. User studies represent a viable alternative to online and offline evaluation schemes, but despite their numerous benefits, they are only rarely used. One of the main reasons behind this fact is that preparing a user study from scratch involves a lot of extra work on top of a simple algorithm proposal. To simplify this task, we propose \textsc{EasyStudy}, a modular framework built on the credo “\textit{Make simple things fast and hard things possible}”. It features ready-to-use datasets, preference elicitation methods, incrementally tuned baseline algorithms, study flow plugins, and evaluation metrics. As a result, a simple study comparing several RS can be deployed with just a few clicks, while more complex study designs can still benefit from a range of reusable components, such as preference elicitation. Overall, \textsc{EasyStudy} dramatically decreases the gap between the laboriousness of offline evaluation vs. user studies and, therefore, may contribute towards the more reliable and insightful user-centric evaluation of next-generation RS.

  DEM  LLM Based Generation of Item-Description for Recommendation System  
  by Arkadeep Acharya (Sony Research India), Brijraj Singh (Sony Research India) and Naoyuki Onoe (Sony Research India). | The description of an item plays a pivotal role in providing concise and informative summaries to captivate potential viewers and is essential for recommendation systems. Traditionally, such descriptions were obtained through manual web scraping techniques, which are time-consuming and susceptible to data inconsistencies. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3.5, and open source LLMs like Alpaca have emerged as powerful tools for natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we have explored how we can use LLMs to generate detailed descriptions of the items. To conduct the study, we have used the MovieLens 1M dataset comprising movie titles and the Goodreads Dataset consisting of names of books and subsequently, an open-sourced LLM, Alpaca, was prompted with few-shot prompting on this dataset to generate detailed movie descriptions considering multiple features like the names of the cast and directors for the ML dataset and the names of the author and publisher for the Goodreads dataset. The generated description was then compared with the scraped descriptions using a combination of Top Hits, MRR, and NDCG as evaluation metrics. The results demonstrated that LLM-based movie description generation exhibits significant promise, with results comparable to the ones obtained by web-scraped descriptions.

To this end, we are interested in developing a locally-focused artist and event recommendation system called Localify.org that supports and promotes local music scenes. Local artists tend to be relatively obscure and reside in the long tail of the artist’s popularity distribution. In this demo paper, we describe both the overall system architecture as well as our core recommender system that uses artist-artist similarity information as opposed to user-artist preference information. We also discuss the role of popularity bias and how we attempt to ameliorate it in the context of local music recommendation.

  DEM  Re2Dan: Retrieval of medical documents for e-Health in Danish  
  by Antonela Tommasel (ISISTAN Research Institute, CONICET-UNCPBA), Rafael Pablos (Aarhus Universitet) and Ira Assent (Aarhus Universitet). | With the clinical environment becoming more data-reliant, healthcare professionals now have unparalleled access to comprehensive clinical information from numerous sources. Then, one of the main issues is how to avoid overloading practitioners with large amounts of (irrelevant) information while guiding them to the relevant documents for specific patient cases. Additional challenges appear due to the shortness of queries and the presence of long (and maybe noisy) contextual information. This demo presents Re2Dan, a web Retrieval and recommender of Danish medical documents. Re2Dan leverages several techniques to improve the quality of retrieved documents. First, it combines lexical and semantic searches to understand the meaning and context of user queries, allowing the retrieval of documents that are conceptually similar to the user’s query. Second, it recommends similar queries, allowing users to discover related documents and insights. Third, when given contextual information (e.g., from patients’ clinical notes), it suggests medical concepts to expand the user query, enabling a more focused search scope and thus obtaining more accurate recommendations. Preliminary analyses showed the effectiveness of the recommender in improving the relevance and comprehensiveness of recommendations, thereby assisting healthcare professionals in finding relevant information for informed decision-making.

  DS  Challenges for Anonymous Session-Based Recommender Systems in Indoor Environments  
  by Alessio Ferrato (Roma TRE). | Recommender Systems (RSs) have gained widespread popularity for providing personalized recommendations in manifold domains. However, considering the growing user privacy concerns, the development of recommender systems that prioritize data protection has become increasingly important. In indoor environments, RSs face unique challenges, and ongoing research is being conducted to address them. Anonymous Session-Based Recommender Systems (ASBRSs) can represent a possible solution to address these challenges while ensuring user privacy. This paper aims to bridge the gap between existing RS research and the demand for privacy-preserving recommender systems, especially in indoor settings, where significant research efforts are underway. Therefore, it proposes three research questions: How does user modeling based on implicit feedback impact on ASBRSs, considering different embedding extraction networks? How can short sessions be leveraged to start the recommendation process in ASBRSs? To what extent can ASBRSs generate fair recommendations? By investigating these questions, this study establishes the foundations for applying ASBRSs in indoor environments, safeguarding user privacy, and contributing to the ongoing research in this field.

  DS  Complementary Product Recommendation for Long-tail Products  
  by Rastislav Papso (Kempelen Institute of Intelligent Technologies). | Identifying complementary relations between products plays a key role in e-commerce Recommender Systems (RS). Existing methods in Complementary Product Recommendation (CPR), however, focus only on identifying complementary relations in huge and data-rich catalogs, while none of them considers real-world scenarios of small and medium e-commerce platforms with limited number of interactions. In this paper, we discuss our research proposal that addresses the problem of identifying complementary relations in such sparse settings. To overcome the data sparsity problem, we propose to first learn complementary relations in large and data-rich catalogs and then transfer learned knowledge to small and scarce ones. To be able to map individual products across different catalogs and thus transfer learned relations between them, we propose to create Product Universal Embedding Space (PUES) using textual and visual product meta-data, which serves as a common ground for the products from arbitrary catalog.

  DS  Overcoming Recommendation Limitations with Neuro-Symbolic Integration  
  by Tommaso Carraro (University of Padova / Fondazione Bruno Kessler). | Despite being studied for over twenty years, Recommender Systems (RSs) still suffer from important issues that limit their applicability in real-world scenarios. Data sparsity, cold start, and explainability are some of the most impacting problems. Intuitively, these historical limitations can be mitigated by injecting prior knowledge into recommendation models. Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) approaches are suitable candidates for achieving this goal. Specifically, they aim to integrate learning (e.g., neural networks) with symbolic reasoning (e.g., logical reasoning). Generally, the integration lets a neural model interact with a logical knowledge base, enabling reasoning capabilities. In particular, NeSy approaches have been shown to deal well with poor training data, and their symbolic component could enhance model transparency. This gives insights that NeSy systems could potentially mitigate the aforementioned RSs limitations. However, the application of such systems to RSs is still in its early stages, and most of the proposed architectures do not really exploit the advantages of a NeSy approach. To this end, we conducted preliminary experiments with a Logic Tensor Network (LTN), a novel NeSy framework. We used the LTN to train a vanilla Matrix Factorization model using a First-Order Logic knowledge base as an objective. In particular, we encoded facts to enable the regularization of the latent factors using content information, obtaining promising results. In this paper, we review existing NeSy recommenders, argue about their limitations, show our preliminary results with the LTN, and propose interesting future works in this novel research area. In particular, we show how the LTN can be intuitively used to regularize models, perform cross-domain recommendation, ensemble learning, and explainable recommendation, reduce popularity bias, and easily define the loss function of a model.

  by Andreas Peintner (University of Innsbruck). | Recommender systems (RecSys) traditionally leverage the users’ rich interaction data with the system, but ignore the sequential dependency of items. Sequential recommender systems aim to predict the next item the user will interact with (e.g., click on, purchase, or listen to) based on the preceding interactions of the user. Current state-of-the-art approaches focus on transformer-based architectures and graph neural networks. Specifically, the modeling of sequences as graphs has shown to be a promising approach to introduce a structured bias into the recommendation learning framework. In this work, we will outline our research of exploring different applications of graphs in sequential recommendation.

  by Junyi Shen (Apple), Dayvid Rodrigues de Oliveira (Apple), Jin Cao (Apple), Brian Knott (Apple), Goodman Gu (Apple), Sindhu Vijaya Raghavan (Apple) and Rob Monarch (Apple). | Recommendation systems in large-scale online marketplaces are essential to aiding users in discovering new content. However, state-of-the-art systems for item-to-item recommendation tasks are often based on a shallow level of contextual relevance, which can make the system insufficient for tasks where item relationships are more nuanced. Contextually relevant item pairs can sometimes have controversial or problematic relationships, and they could degrade user experiences and brand perception when recommended to users. For example, a recommendation of a divorce and co-parenting book can create a disturbing experience for someone who is downloading or viewing a marriage therapy book. In this paper, we propose a classifier to identify and prevent such problematic item-to-item recommendations and to enhance overall user experiences. The proposed approach utilizes active learning to sample hard examples effectively across sensitive item categories and uses human raters for data labeling. We also perform offline experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of this system for identifying and filtering controversial recommendations while maintaining recommendation quality.

  by Benedikt Schifferer (NVIDIA), Wenzhe Shi (ShareChat), Gabriel de Souza Pereira Moreira (NVIDIA), Even Oldridge (NVIDIA), Chris Deotte (NVIDIA), Gilberto Titericz (NVIDIA), Kazuki Onodera (NVIDIA), Praveen Dhinwa (ShareChat), Vishal Agrawal (ShareChat) and Chris Green (ShareChat). | Recommender systems are an essential component of online systems, providing users with a personalized experience. Some recommendation scenarios such as social networks or news are very dynamic, with new items added continuously and the interest of users changing over time due to breaking news or popular events. Incremental training is a popular technique to keep recommender models up-to-date in those dynamic platforms. In this paper, we provide an empirical analysis of a large industry dataset from the Sharechat app MOJ, a social media platform for short videos, to answer relevant questions like – how often should I retrain the model? – do different models, features and dataset sizes benefit from incremental training? – Do all users and items benefit the same from incremental training?

  IND  Learning From Negative User Feedback and Measuring Responsiveness for Sequential Recommenders  
  by Yueqi Wang (Google), Yoni Halpern (Google), Shuo Chang (Google), Jingchen Feng (Google), Elaine Ya Le (Google), Longfei Li (Google), Xujian Liang (Google), Min-Cheng Huang (Google), Shane Li (Google), Alex Beutel (Google), Yaping Zhang (Google) and Shuchao Bi (Google). | Sequential recommenders have been widely used in industry due to their strength in modeling user preferences. While these models excel at learning a user’s positive interests, less attention has been paid to learn from negative user feedback. Negative user feedback is an important lever of user control, and comes with an expectation that recommenders should respond quickly and reduce similar recommendations to the user. However, negative feedback signals are often ignored in the training objective of sequential recommenders, which primarily aim at predicting positive user interactions. In this work, we incorporate explicit and implicit negative user feedback into the training objective of sequential recommenders using a “not-to-recommend” loss function that optimizes for the log likelihood of not recommending items with negative feedback. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using live experiments on a large-scale industrial recommender system. Furthermore, we address a challenge in measuring recommender responsiveness to negative feedback by developing a counterfactual simulation framework to compare recommender responses between different user actions, showing improved responsiveness from the modeling change.

  IND  Leveling Up the Peloton Homescreen: A System and Algorithm for Dynamic Row Ranking  
  by Natalia Chen (Peloton Interactive), Nganba Meetei (Peloton Interactive), Nilothpal Talukder (Peloton Interactive) and Alexey Zankevich (Peloton Interactive). | At Peloton, we constantly strive to improve the member experience by highlighting personalized content that speaks to each individual user. One area of focus is our landing page, the homescreen, consisting of numerous rows of class recommendations used to captivate our users and guide them through our growing catalog of workouts. In this paper, we discuss a strategy we have used to increase the rate of workouts started from our homescreen through a Thompson sampling approach to row ranking, enhanced further with a collaborative filtering method based on user similarity calculated from workout history.

  IND  Optimizing Podcast Discovery: Unveiling Amazon Music’s Retrieval and Ranking Framework  
  by Geetha Aluri (Amazon), Paul Greyson (Amazon) and Joaquin Delgado (Amazon). | This work presents the search architecture of Amazon Music, which is a highly efficient system designed to retrieve relevant content for users. The architecture consists of three key stages: indexing, retrieval, and ranking. During the indexing stage, data is meticulously parsed and processed to create a comprehensive index that contains dense representations and essential information about each document (such as a music or podcast entity) in the collection, including its title, metadata, and relevant attributes. This indexing process enables fast and efficient data access during retrieval. The retrieval stage utilizes multi-faceted retrieval strategies, resulting in improved identification of candidate matches compared to traditional structured search methods. Subsequently, candidates are ranked based on their relevance to the customer’s query, taking into account document features and personalized factors. With a specific focus on the podcast use case, this paper highlights the deployment of the architecture and demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing podcast search capabilities, providing tailored and engaging content experiences.

  IND  Reward innovation for long-term member satisfaction  
  by Gary Tang (Netflix), Jiangwei Pan (Netflix), Henry Wang (Netflix) and Justin Basilico (Netflix). | Many large-scale recommender systems train on engagements because of their data abundance, immediacy of feedback, and correlation to user preferences. At Netflix and many digital products, engagement is an imperfect proxy to the overall goal of long-term user satisfaction. One way we address this misalignment is via reward innovation. In this paper, we provide a high-level description of the problem and motivate our approach. Finally, we present some practical insights into this track of work including challenges, lessons learned, and systems we’ve built to support the effort.

  IND  Station and Track Attribute-Aware Music Personalization  
  by M. Jeffrey Mei (SiriusXM Radio Inc.), Oliver Bembom (SiriusXM Radio Inc.) and Andreas Ehmann (SiriusXM Radio Inc.). | We present a transformer for music personalization that recommends tracks given a station seed (artist) and improves the accuracy vs. a baseline matrix factorization method by 10%. Adding more embeddings to capture track and station attributes further improves the accuracy of our recommendations, and also improves recommendation diversity, i.e. mitigates popularity bias. We analyze the learned embeddings and find they learn both explicit attributes provided at training and implicit attributes that may inform listener preferences. We also find that unlike matrix factorization, our model can identify and transfer relevant listener preferences across different genres and artists.

  IND  Track Mix Generation on Music Streaming Services using Transformers  
  by Walid Bendada (Deezer Research), Théo Bontempelli (Deezer Research), Mathieu Morlon (Deezer Research), Benjamin Chapus (Deezer Research), Thibault Cador (Deezer Research), Thomas Bouabça (Deezer Research) and Guillaume Salha-Galvan (Deezer Research). | This paper introduces Track Mix, a personalized playlist generation system released in 2022 on the music streaming service Deezer. Track Mix automatically generates “mix” playlists inspired by initial music tracks, allowing users to discover music similar to their favorite content. To generate these mixes, we consider a Transformer model trained on millions of track sequences from user playlists. In light of the growing popularity of Transformers in recent years, we analyze the advantages, drawbacks, and technical challenges of using such a model for mix generation on the service, compared to a more traditional collaborative filtering approach. Since its release, Track Mix has been generating playlists for millions of users daily, enhancing their music discovery experience on Deezer.
