  2.  Background   
 Formal methods have been advocated as a means of increasing the reliability of systems, especially those which are safety or business critical, but the industrial uptake of such methods has been slow. This is due to the perceived difficulty of mathematical nature of these methods, the lack of tool support, and the lack of precedents where formal methods has been proven to be effective. It is even more difficult to develop automatic specification and verification tools due to limitations like state explosion, undecidability, etc. This working group will bring together researchers of the ERCIM consortium in order to promote the use of formal methods within industry.  
 The behaviour of reactive systems is largely conditioned by the interaction with events of the external environment the sequentialization of which is not predictable. The complexity of the systems' behaviour increases considerably when the timing dependencies in the execution of events are taken into account.  
 The above features are typical of a large class of systems including control systems, automation systems, and communication systems and results in the extreme difficulty of the verification of their correctness.  
 In the industrial context correctness verification is usually performed by means of testing; the system is provided with input sequences drawn from a proper "coverage set" and its resulting behaviour is observed.  
 Due to the multiplicity of possibilities both for inputs to a system and originating from more and more use of parallelism and concurrency this approach turns out to be very costly and in any case it does not allow for the exhaustive verification of the correctness of the system. It allows only to detect errors which take place during the execution sequences used for the test.  
 In the last decade several theories have been developed which aim at coping with the problem of systems correctness by means of formal methodologies for the specification, design and verification of systems. These theories have been extended in order to deal with time, probability and stochastic aspects of behaviours.  
 Also real-time models where time is a dense quantity and verification can be done algorithmically (automatically) has been developed.  
  validation of the specification 
  design 
  verification of the final product against the requirements 
  For each of the above activities different techniques have been developed independently. They are usually not at all integrated neither compatible and quite often they have been tried only on toy-examples, bringing to results which are rather difficult to compare. Finally, most of the automatic tools developed for supporting the use of formal methods lack of industrial strength and so turn out to be unpractical when used in the industrial context.

 Title | : | SMT: Something you Must Try [Joint talk with iFM] 
  Abstract | : SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solving is a technology for the fully automated solution of logical formulas. Due to their impressive efficiency, SMT solvers are nowadays frequently used in a wide variety of applications. These tools are general purpose and as off-the-shelf solvers, their usage is truly integrated. A typical application encodes real-world problems as logical formulas, whose solutions can be decoded to solutions of the real-world problem. In this talk we give some insights into the mechanisms of SMT solving, discuss some areas of application, and present a novel application from the domain of simulation.

 Trust Modelling and Verification Using Event-B   
 Authors: | Asieh Salehi Fathabadi and Vahid Yazdanpanah 
  Abstract: | Trust is a crucial component in collaborative multiagent systems (MAS) involving humans and autonomous AI agents. Rather than assuming trust based on past system behaviours, it is important to formally verify trust by modelling the current state and capabilities of agents. We argue for verifying actual trust relations based on agents' abilities to deliver intended outcomes in specific contexts. To enable reasoning about different notions of trust, we propose using the refinement-based formal method Event-B. Refinement allows progressively introducing new aspects of trust - from abstract to concrete models incorporating knowledge and runtime states. We demonstrate modelling three trust concepts and verifying associated trust properties in MAS. The formal, correctness-by-construction approach allows deducing guarantees about trustworthy autonomy in human-AI partnerships. Overall, our contribution facilitates rigorous verification of trust in multiagent systems. 
 Runtime Verification of Learning Properties for Reinforcement Learning Algorithms   
 Authors: | Tommaso Mannucci and Julio de Oliveira Filho 
  Abstract: | Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms interact with their environment in a trial-and-error fashion. Such interactions can be expensive, inefficient, and timely when learning on a physical system rather than in a simulation. This work develops new runtime verification techniques to predict when the learning phase has not met or will not meet qualitative and timely expectations. This paper presents three verification properties concerning the quality and timeliness of learning in RL algorithms. With each property, we propose design steps for monitoring and assessing the properties during the system's operation. 
 Online Reachability Analysis and Space Convexification for Autonomous Racing   
 Authors: | Sergiy Bogomolov, Taylor T Johnson, Diego Manzanas, Patrick Musau, and Paulius Stankaitis 
  Abstract: | This paper presents an optimisation-based approach for an obstacle avoidance problem within an autonomous vehicle racing context. Our control regime leverages online reachability analysis and sensor data to compute the maximal safe traversable region that an agent can traverse within the environment. The idea is to first compute a non-convex safe region, which then can be convexified via a novel coupled separating hyperplane algorithm. This derived safe area is then used to formulate a nonlinear model-predictive control problem that seeks to find an optimal and safe driving trajectory. We evaluate the proposed approach through a series of diverse experiments and assess the runtime requirements of our proposed approach through an analysis of the effects of a set of varying optimisation objectives for generating these coupled hyperplanes. 
 What to tell when? -- Information Provision as a Game   
 Authors: | Astrid Rakow, Akhila Bairy, and Mehrnoush Hajnorouzi 
  Abstract: | Constantly informing systems (CIS), that is technical systems that provide us with information over a long period of time, face the challenge of providing us with helpful information. The information base of a human model changes over time but also his mood and his ability to accept information. An information provision strategy should hence take such aspects into account. In this paper, we describe our vision of an approach to aid the design of CIS. We envision using psychological models of the human mind and emotions in an information provision game. Its analysis gives comparative insights into design variants. 
 Model checking for Robot Reactive Planning   
 Authors: | Christopher Chandler, Bernd Porr, Alice Miller, and Giulia Lafratta 
  Abstract: | In this paper, we show how model checking can be used to create multi-step plans for a differential drive wheeled robot so that it can avoid immediate danger. Using a small, purpose built model checking algorithm in situ we generate plans in real time in a way that reflects the egocentric reactive response of simple biological agents. Our approach is based on chaining temporary control systems which are spawned to eliminate disturbances in the local environment that disrupt an autonomous agent from its preferred action (or resting state). The method involves a novel discretization of 2D LiDAR data which is sensitive to bounded stochastic variations in the immediate environment. We operationalise multi-step planning using invariant checking by forward depth-first search, using a cul-de-sac scenario as a first test case. Our results demonstrate that model checking can be used to plan efficient trajectories for local obstacle avoidance, improving on the performance of a reactive agent which can only plan one step. We achieve this in near real-time using no pre-computed data. While our method has limitations, we believe our approach shows promise as an avenue for the development of safe, reliable and transparent trajectory planning in the context of autonomous vehicles. 
 Towards Formal Fault Injection for Safety Assessment of Automated Systems   
 Authors: | Ashfaq Farooqui and Behrooz Sangchoolie 
  Abstract: | Reasoning about the safety, security, and other dependability attributes of autonomous systems is a challenge that needs to be addressed before the adoption of such systems in day-to-day life. _Formal methods_ contain a class of methods that can mathematically reason about the system's behavior. Since these methods employ mathematical techniques, a correctness proof is sufficient to conclude the system's dependability. However, these methods are usually applied to abstract models of the system, which might not fully represent the actual system. _Fault injection_, on the other hand, is a class of testing methods that are often used to evaluate the dependability of systems at different phases of the development lifecycle. However, the amount of testing required to evaluate the system is rather large and often a problem. This vision paper presents the concept of _formal fault injection_, a fusion of these two techniques. Our vision involves integrating them throughout the development lifecycle to enhance the dependability of autonomous systems. We advocate for a more cohesive approach by identifying five areas of mutual support between formal methods and fault injection. By forging stronger ties between the two fields, we pave the way for developing safe and dependable autonomous systems. This paper delves into the integration's potential and outlines future research avenues, addressing open challenges along the way. 
 Formal Verification of Long Short-Term Memory based Audio Classifiers: A Star based Approach   
 Authors: | Neelanjana Pal and Taylor T Johnson 
  Abstract: | Formally verifying audio classification systems is essential to ensure accurate signal classification across real-world applications like surveillance, automotive voice commands, and multimedia content management, preventing potential errors with serious consequences. Drawing from recent research, this study advances the utilization of star-set-based formal verification, extended through reachability analysis, tailored explicitly for Long Short-Term Memory architectures and their Convolutional variations within the audio classification domain. By conceptualizing the classification process as a sequence of set operations, the star set-based reachability approach streamlines the exploration of potential operational states attainable by the system. The paper serves as an encompassing case study, validating and verifying sequence audio classification analytics within real-world contexts. It accentuates the necessity for robustness verification to ensure precise and dependable predictions, particularly in light of the impact of noise on the accuracy of output classifications. 
 Correct-by-Construction Control for Stochastic and Uncertain Dynamical Models via Formal Abstractions   
 Authors: | Thom Badings, Licio Romao, Alessandro Abate, and Nils Jansen 
  Abstract: | Automated synthesis of correct-by-construction controllers for autonomous systems is crucial for their deployment in safety-critical scenarios. Such autonomous systems are naturally modeled as stochastic dynamical models. The general problem is to compute a controller that provably satisfies a given task, represented as a probabilistic temporal logic specification. However, factors such as stochastic uncertainty, imprecisely known parameters, and hybrid features make this problem challenging. We have developed an abstraction framework that can be used to solve this problem under various modeling assumptions. Our approach is based on a robust finite-state abstraction of the stochastic dynamical model in the form of a Markov decision process with intervals of probabilities (iMDP). We use state-of-the-art verification techniques to compute an optimal policy on the iMDP with guarantees for satisfying the given specification. We then show that, by construction, we can refine this policy into a feedback controller for which these guarantees carry over to the dynamical model. In this short paper, we survey our recent research in this area and highlight two challenges (related to scalability and dealing with nonlinear dynamics) that we aim to address with our ongoing research. 
 Automatic Generation of Scenarios for System-level Simulation-based Verification of Autonomous Driving Systems   
 Authors: | Srajan Goyal, Alberto Griggio, Jacob Kimblad, and Stefano Tonetta 
  Abstract: | With the increasing complexity of Automated Driving Systems (ADS), ensuring their safety and re- liability has become a critical challenge. The Verification and Validation (V&V) of these systems are particularly demanding when AI components are employed to implement perception and/or control functions. In the ESA-funded project VIVAS, we developed a generic framework for system-level simulation-based V&V of autonomous systems. The approach is based on a simulation model of the system, an abstract model that describes symbolically the system behavior, and formal methods to generate scenarios and to verify the simulation executions. Various coverage criteria can be defined to guide the automated generation of the scenarios. In this paper, we describe the instantiation of the VIVAS framework for an ADS case study. This is based on the integration of CARLA, a widely-used driving simulator, and its ScenarioRunner tool, which enables the creation of diverse and complex driving scenarios. This is also used in the CARLA Autonomous Driving Challenge to validate different ADS agents for perception and control based on AI, shared by the CARLA community. We describe the development of an abstract ADS model and the formulation of a coverage criterion that focuses on the behaviors of vehicles relative to the vehicle with ADS under verification. Leveraging the VIVAS framework, we generate and execute various driving scenarios, thus testing the capabilities of the AI components. The results show the effectiveness of VIVAS in automatically generating scenarios for system-level simulation- based V&V of an automated driving system using CARLA and ScenarioRunner. Therefore, they highlight the potential of the approach as a powerful tool in the future of ADS V&V methodologies. 
 Extending Neural Network Verification to a Larger Family of Piece-wise Linear Activation Functions   
 Authors: | László Antal, Hana Masara, and Erika Ábrahám 
  Abstract: | In this paper, we extend an available neural network verification technique to support a wider class of piece-wise linear activation functions. Furthermore, we extend the algorithms, which provide in their original form exact respectively over-approximative results for bounded input sets represented as star sets, to allow also unbounded input sets. We implemented our algorithms and demonstrate their effectiveness on some case studies.

 Reducing the likelihood of faults and failures in the development and in the use of interactive systems becomes a more and more inescapable necessity.: Indeed the use of such systems is becoming widespread in applications that demand high dependability due to usability, safety or, security requirements while taking into account additional considerations such as User Experience or Learnability. Interactive systems make use of more and more sophisticated electronic devices and are made up by multiple hardware and software components. These systems are in fact large artifacts that are also becoming increasingly ubiquitous and being used in new and more complex situations.  
 Consequently, the use of formal methods in providing some assurance on the dependability of interactive systems should take into account the wider socio-technical system. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers in computer science, human factors, and other areas of HCI, from both academia and industry, who are interested in both formal methods and interactive system design and development.
