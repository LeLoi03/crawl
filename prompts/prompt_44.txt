Non-citable documents   
 Not every article in a journal is considered primary research and therefore "citable", this chart shows the ratio of a journal's articles including substantial research (research articles, conference papers and reviews) in three year windows vs. those documents other than research articles, reviews and conference papers.

19th International Conference on Network and Service Management   
  Niagara Falls, Canada, // 30 October - 2 November 2023   
  Network and Service Management in the Era of Generative AI and Digital Twins    
 Falls View 
 Welcome to CNSM 2023  
 It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2023 edition of CNSM, the International Conference on Network and Service Management. CNSM is the annual Fall event of the network management community, co-sponsored by its technical committees, namely the IFIP working group 6.6 on Network and Distributed Systems Management and the IEEE Communications Society Committee on Network Operations and Management.  
 CNSM 2023 program builds on the timely and overarching topics of AI and digitalization under the theme of network and service management in the Era of Generative AI and Digital Twins. The 3-day main program features a total of 8 plenary technical paper presentation sessions, a line-up of 5 compelling keynotes from academia and industry, a panel discussion among experts in the field, as well as posters and demonstrations. A mini conference and the 3rd International Workshop on Analytics for Service and Application Management precede the main conference program for focused and scoped technical discussions.  
 CNSM 2023 would have not been possible without the tireless efforts of the organizing and technical committees and the contribution of the authors and the reviewers. We are most grateful to them and to our patrons, sponsors and supporters. We hope that you will enjoy CNSM 2023 technical and social programs in Niagara Falls.
