 In addition to being an historical event for the scientific community, NOMS 2023 will host an exciting program including keynotes, panels, technical sessions, demo sessions, dissertation session, mini-conference sessions, poster sessions, tutorials, and workshops. These events provide rich opportunities for participants to learn, share, exchange, and set the current and future directions and developments of network operations and management.  
 NOMS 2023 comes at the right time where the networks and services play a critical role in new value creation, businesses growth but also in contributing to the development of humanity.  
 This year's theme is “Integrated Management Towards Resilient Networks and Services.”  
 Technologies evolve at a fast pace in networking: 5G networks are being deployed and 6G network technological components are already developed and the overall architecture is in an active specification phase. Softwarization is being generalized at all levels of the protocol stacks and agile processes are in place to speed up dynamic service delivery and quality assurance across the globe and beyond. Digital twins of networks emerge to ease and automate the huge demand on monitoring, control and management of the underlying highly dynamic environments. Finally, numerous machine learning approaches are already utilized for optimized control, security and management.  
 Recent history has shown that the dynamics and manageability of networks are major value to maintain connectivity and service quality under extreme external conditions like the pandemics or in a situation of war. All-level programmability also opens new challenges to make the complex task of networking resilient.  
 NOMS 2023 is becoming a reality thanks to the involvement of all those in the network and service management community who share their passion for the field and who spend time to its development: participants, sponsors, authors, PhD and Master students, engineers working in the field, TPC co-chairs and members, Workshop, tutorial, session organizers and many more. As General Co-Chairs, we are extremely proud and happy to help the field grow !

  IFIP/IEEE NOMS 2023 Conference Highlights  
 By Kemal Akkaya - General Co-Chair, Florida International University, USA   
 The conference venue was FIU Kovens Center which was located at Florida International University (FIU) Biscayne Bay Campus by the ocean. Indeed, FIU was not only a local supporter of the event with its venue and volunteers but also a gold patron through its Cybersecurity Preeminent program, which is a university wide center focusing on interdisciplinary cybersecurity research and education.  
 Other patron was Futurewei Technologies which was at the Platinum level. The location of the venue by the beach and accessibility of Miami from various locations in the world made Miami a competitive candidate for winning the hosting of NOMS 2023.  
 After finishing the Formula 1 race held in Miami, conference participants attended the first day of NOMS on Monday May 8th with 3 workshops, mini-conference and a tutorial. The main conference started on Tuesday with a welcoming from conference organizers and a keynote. On the evening of the same day, the conference welcomed its guests to the reception on the terrace of the beautiful Kovens Center. The attendees enjoyed a beautiful Miami breeze along with a spectacular ocean bay view while enjoying their conversations after a long time that was shadowed with on-line conferences.  
 The following days of NOMS conference also included a packed program with 4 more keynotes, panels, demos, distinguished expert panels, tutorials as well as many technical paper sessions. The demos, in particular, attracted a lot of lively one-to-one discussions and offer great engagement. The conference banquet was held on Wednesday again at the Kovens Center ballroom and conference participants again had the opportunity to mingle on the terrace on a beautiful Miami evening. The last day of the conference, on Thursday evening, the conference chairs announced the best paper, demo, picture and other awards while inviting people for NOMS 2024, which will be held in Seoul, S. Korea. On the same evening, the conference organizing and steering committees held their meeting with an enjoyable dinner. On Friday, May 12th, the conference resumed with 3 more workshops, mini-conference and a tutorial and concluded with a great success.  
 During 5 days at the conference, participants had countless opportunities to network with each other for collaboration and exchange of numerous technical ideas. FIU Biscayne Bay campus allowed the participants to take a short walk on the campus trail by the beach. Whoa app which was used as the official communication app of the conference was full of pictures from the participants enjoying their time on campus as well as performing other attractions in greater Miami area that included scenes from beaches, Miami Heat NBA game, shopping malls and of course alligators!  
 Overall, IFIP/IEEE NOMS 2023 has been a great success with its lively technical sessions, abundant opportunities for networking and beautiful weather for its social events. After 3 years of online conferences, many participants acknowledged the fact that on-site conferences are much more engaging and useful and thus they should not be replaced with online options. The only complaint about the conference came from Europeans who said that Kovens center was too cold, and they were freezing during the sessions! We look forward to seeing the network management community again next year in S. Korea.

 About the India HCI conference  
 India HCI is a premier international conference in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) that is held annually in India. It aims to positively impact and shape humanity through high-quality research in HCI and Design. The 14th international India HCI 2023 conference is hosted by the  School of Design at   UPES   in-cooperation with the  ACM  amongst Dehradun’s beautifully lush and verdant environs.   
 The conference theme is “  HCI for Enabling Creativity”  and aims to initiate dialogues, debates, and discussions that enable synergies between Creativity and HCI. We invite authors to present bold ideas and research that further expand the boundaries of HCI research.   
 We live in an exciting era where new technologies have transformed how we engage and interact with people, products, services, and our environment. In the past few years, it has advanced to the point where it significantly influences the creative expression of individuals and the way we work and engage with artefacts. Advances in technology raise important and exciting questions about how to use technology to augment and foster creative activity and simultaneously challenge the very concept of creativity itself. The role of HCI and design in fostering creativity will be critical.   
 The theme of IndiaHCI 2023 encourages authors and delegates to think critically about how emerging media and technology facilitate creativity in all its forms. Using a Design lens, this theme will enable discussions that push the boundaries of creativity research in HCI by gaining a holistic understanding of how people and citizens interact with new technologies, AI, materials, and emerging media.

 Papers   
 India HCI 2023 is the 14th edition of the international conference series on Human-Computer Interaction. Papers are the main medium for conveying new research results at India HCI. Submissions are sought that describe original unpublished work generally in the field of HCI. India HCI uses an anonymous submission process (similar to CHI) for paper submissions. Please consult the India HCI ‘23 Author’s Guide  for information on the ACM Paper Format (also mentioned below) and conference policies on previous and simultaneous publications. To preserve anonymity during review, the authors must remove their names and affiliations from the manuscript  . If authors have conducted relevant prior work, they must cite it appropriately while also referring to this work in third person. Authors can revise their submissions based on the reviews they receive, prior to submitting their camera-ready manuscripts. Until the camera-readies have been checked off by the programme committee, these must be considered conditionally accepted.  
 Topics of relevance include but are not limited to:   
  HCI for Creativity/ Creativity in HCI/ Creativity and HCI 
  Web 3.0/ Metaverse/ AR/VR/MR/ Avatar Psychology 
  A ll papers should be submitted electronically to  India HCI Electronic Submission site  by  July 13,  2023.   
 Paper Length   
 To be considered Full Papers, contributions should be more than six pages long (single column template). There is no hard page limit, but long papers without a proportional contribution are more likely to be rejected. Previous papers (if converted to the new ACM single-column format) would have run 14-18 pages in length.  
 Reviewing Process   
 All acceptances will be conditional pending changes that the papers committee may suggest or require for the final camera-ready draft of the paper. The primary author of each accepted paper will receive detailed instructions on how to submit a final, publication-ready version of the paper. The paper will not be formally accepted to India HCI until authors revise it and submit a final draft for approval by the programme committee. Some submissions may be asked to undergo a more intense shepherding process in order to bring them to the standard required for India HCI. The deadline for submitting the “camera ready” version after all changes will be September 30, 2023  . Additionally, at least one author of each paper needs to register for the conference by this date.  
 Associate Chairs   
 Dipanjan Chakraborty, BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus
