 The Security of “2FLIP” Authentication Scheme for VANETs: Attacks and Rectifications   
 October 2022  · IEEE Open Journal of Vehicular Technology

  Wireless broadcast transmission enables Inter-vehicle or Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication among nearby vehicles and with nearby fixed equipment, referred to as Road Side Units (RSUs). The vehicles and RSUs within transmission range establish a self-organizing network called Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET). The V2V communication in VANETs is vulnerable to cyber attacks involving message ... [Show full abstract]  manipulation. Thus, mechanisms should be applied to ensure both the authenticity and integrity of the data broadcast. However, due to privacy concerns, it is important to avoid the use of identifiers that may aid tracking and surveillance of drivers. This is a serious constraint on authentication mechanisms. Recently, Wang et al. [1] proposed A Two-Factor Lightweight Privacy Preserving Authentication Scheme for VANET named 2FLIP. They claim that their scheme includes a secure system-key update protocol to restore the whole system when necessary and further that this resists an adversary obtaining any information about the updated system-key. In this paper, we show that this is incorrect: 2FLIP does not provide perfect forward secrecy. This results in a known-key attack, as well as message forgery attack by an external adversary who may be an unregistered vehicle user. This external adversary can generate valid anonymous messages and further, they cannot be traced. The 2FLIP scheme is efficient, so we propose a modification to improve the security. We provide a formal security proof to show that our proposal is indeed provably secure. We demonstrate the efficiency of our proposal by conducting extensive performance analysis. We believe the enhanced system-key update protocol will be useful for application by researchers and designers in current and future VANET authentication schemes.

  Quantum computing is emerging as a significant threat to information protected by widely used cryptographic systems. Cryptographic methods, once deemed secure for decades, are now at risk of being compromised, posing a massive threat to the security of sensitive data and communications across enterprises worldwide. As a result, there is an urgent need to migrate to quantum-resistant cryptographic ... [Show full abstract]  systems. This is no simple task. Migrating to a quantum-safe state is a complex process, and many organisations lack the in-house expertise to navigate this transition without guidance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework designed to assist enterprises with this migration. Our framework outlines essential steps involved in the cryptographic migration process, and leverages existing organisational inventories. The framework facilitates the efficient identification of cryptographic assets and can be integrated with other enterprise frameworks smoothly. To underscore its practicality and effectiveness, we have incorporated case studies that utilise graph-theoretic techniques to pinpoint and assess cryptographic dependencies. This is useful in prioritising crypto-systems for replacement.

  In intelligent vehicular networks, vehicles have enhanced sensing capabilities, and carry computing and communication platforms to enable new versatile systems known as Vehicular Communication (VC) systems. Vehicles communicate with other vehicles and with nearby fixed equipment to support different applications, including those which increase driver awareness of the surroundings. This should ... [Show full abstract]  result in improved safety and may optimize traffic. However, VC systems are vulnerable to cyber attacks involving message manipulation. Research aimed at tackling this problem has resulted in the proposal of multiple authentication protocols. Several existing survey papers have attempted to classify some of these protocols based on a limited set of characteristics. However, to date there is no generic framework to support the comparison of these protocols and provide guidance for design and evaluation. Most existing classifications either use computation complexity of cryptographic techniques as a criterion, or they fail to make connections between different important aspects of authentication. This paper provides such a framework; proposing a new taxonomy to enable a consistent means of classifying authentication schemes based upon seven main criteria. The main contribution of this study is a framework to enable protocol designers and investigators to adequately compare and select authentication schemes when deciding on particular protocols to implement in an application. Our framework can be applied in design, making choices appropriate for the intended context in both intra-vehicle and inter-vehicle communications. We demonstrate the application of our framework using two different types of case study: individual analysis and hypothetical design. Additionally, this work makes several related contributions. We present the network model, outline the applications, list the communication patterns and the underlying standards, and discuss the necessity of using cryptography and key-management in VC systems. We also review the threats, authentication, and privacy requirements in vehicular networks.

 Pervasive User Data Collection from Cyberspace: Privacy Concerns and Countermeasures

  The increasing use of technologies, particularly computing and communication paradigms, has significantly influenced our daily lives. Interconnecting devices and networks provides convenient platforms for information exchange and facilitates pervasive user data collection. This new environment presents serious privacy challenges. User activities can be continuously monitored in both digital and ... [Show full abstract]  physical realms. Gathered data can be aggregated and analysed, revealing aspects of user behaviour that may not be apparent from a single data point. The very items that facilitate connectivity simultaneously increase the risk of privacy breaches. The data gathered to provide services can also be used for monitoring and surveillance. This paper discerns three novel categories of privacy concerns relating to pervasive user data collection: privacy and user activity in cyberspace, privacy in personal cyber–physical systems, and privacy in proactive user-driven data collection. We emphasise the primary challenges, ranging from identity tracking in browsing histories to intricate issues in opportunistic networks, situating each within practical, real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we assess the effectiveness of current countermeasures, investigating their strengths and limitations. This paper explores the challenges in preserving privacy in user interactions with dynamic interconnected systems and suggests countermeasures to mitigate identified privacy risks.

 This book constitutes the proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Advanced Concepts for Intelligent Vision Systems, ACIVS 2023, held in Kumamoto, Japan, during August 2023.  
 Semi-supervised Classification and Segmentation of Forest Fire Using Autoencoders  
  Forests play a crucial role in sustaining life on earth by providing vital ecosystem services and supporting a wide range of species. The unprecedented increase in forest fires aka ‘infernos’ due to global warming i.e. rising temperatures and changing weather patterns, is quite alarming. Recently, machine learning and computer vision-based techniques are leveraged to proactively analyze forest fire events. To this end, we propose novel semi-supervised classification and segmentation techniques using autoencoders to analyse forest fires, that require significantly less labelling effort in contrast to the fully-supervised methods. In particular, semi-supervised classification of forest fire using Convolutional autoencoders is proposed. Further, Class Activation Map-based techniques and patch-wise extraction methods are envisaged for the segmentation task. Extensive experiments are carried out on two publicly available large datasets i.e. FLAME and Corsican datasets. The proposed models are found to be outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches.

 YOLOPoint: Joint Keypoint and Object Detection  
  Intelligent vehicles of the future must be capable of understanding and navigating safely through their surroundings. Camera-based vehicle systems can use keypoints as well as objects as low- and high-level landmarks for GNSS-independent SLAM and visual odometry. To this end we propose YOLOPoint, a convolutional neural network model that simultaneously detects keypoints and objects in an image by combining YOLOv5 and SuperPoint to create a single forward-pass network that is both real-time capable and accurate. By using a shared backbone and a light-weight network structure, YOLOPoint is able to perform competitively on both the HPatches and KITTI benchmarks.

 Segmentation of Range-Azimuth Maps of FMCW Radars with a Deep Convolutional Neural Network  
  In this paper, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network for the segmentation of Range-Azimuth (RA) maps produced by a low-power Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar to facilitate autonomous operation on a moving platform in a dense, feature-rich environment such as warehouses, storage and industrial sites. Our key contribution is a compact neural network architecture that estimates the extent of free space with high distance and azimuth resolution, yielding high-quality navigation cues at a much lower computational cost than full 2D space segmentation techniques. We demonstrate our method on a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in an industrial warehouse environment.

 Upsampling Data Challenge: Object-Aware Approach for 3D Object Detection in Rain  
  Lidar-based 3D object detection has been widely adopted for autonomous vehicles. However, adverse weather conditions, such as rain, pose significant challenges by reducing both detection distance and accuracy. Intuitively, one could adopt upsampling to improve detection accuracy. Nevertheless, the task of increasing the number of target points, especially the key detection points crucial for object detection, remains an open issue. In this paper, we explore how an additional data upsampling pre-processing stage to increase the density of the point cloud can potentially benefit deep-learning object detection. Unlike the state-of-the-art upsampling approaches which aim to improve point cloud appearance and uniformity, we are interested in object detection. The object of interest, rather than full scenarios or small patches, is used to train the network - we call it object-aware learning. Additionally, data collection and labelling are time-consuming and expensive, especially for rain scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we propose a semi-supervised upsampling network that can be trained using a relatively small number of labelled simulated objects. Lastly, we verify a well-established sensor/rain simulator, using a publicly available database. The experimental results on a database generated by this simulator are promising and have shown that our object-aware networks can extend the detection range in rainy scenarios and can achieve improvements in Bird’s-eye-View Intersection-over-Union (BEV IoU) detection accuracy.

 A Single Image Neuro-Geometric Depth Estimation  
  This paper introduces a novel neuro-geometric methodology for single image object depth estimation, abbreviated as NGDE. The proposed methodology can be described as a hybrid methodology since it combines a geometrical and a deep learning component. NGDE leverages the geometric camera model to initially estimate a set of probable depth values between the camera and the object. Then, these probable depth values along with the pixel coordinates that define the boundaries of an object, are propagated to a deep learning component, appropriately trained to output the final object depth estimation. Unlike previous approaches, NGDE does not require any prior information about the scene, such as the horizon line or reference objects. Instead, NGDE uses a virtual 3D point cloud projected to the 2D image plane that is used to estimate probable depth values indicated by 3D-2D point correspondences. Then by leveraging a multilayer perceptron (MLP) that considers both the probable depth values and the 2D bounding box of the object, NGDE is capable of accurately estimating the depth of an object. A major advantage of NGDE over the state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods is that it utilizes a simple MLP instead of computationally complex Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The evaluation of NGDE on KITTI indicates its advantageous performance over relevant state-of-the-art approaches.

 IRIS Segmentation Technique Using IRIS-UNet Method  
  Precise segmentation of the iris from the eye images is an essential task in iris diagnosis. Most of the predictions fail due to improper segmentation of iris images, which results in false predictions of the patient’s disease. However, the traditional methods for segmenting the iris are not suitable for iris diagnosis applications. In the field of medical purposes. The iris of the eye could be separated from the eye using deep learning techniques. To overcome this issue, we design a model called Iris-UNet which can effectively segment the limbic and pupillary boundary from the eye images. Using the Iris-UNet model, high-level features are extracted in the encoder path, and segmentation of limbic and pupillary boundaries takes place in the decoder path. We have evaluated our Iris-UNet model on real patient datasets: CASIA, MMU, and PEC datasets. Our Iris-UNet model shows an outperforming solution through the experimental results compared with other traditional methods.

 Quality Assessment for High Dynamic Range Stereoscopic Omnidirectional Image System  
  This paper focuses on visual experience of high dynamic range (HDR) stereoscopic omnidirectional image (HSOI) system, which includes such as HSOI generation, encoding/decoding, tone mapping (TM) and terminal visualization. From the perspective of quantifying coding distortion and TM distortion in HSOI system, a “no-reference (NR) plus reduced-reference (RR)” HSOI quality assessment method is proposed by combining Retinex theory and two-layer distortion simulation of HSOI system. The NR module quantizes coding distortion for HDR images only with coding distortion. The RR module mainly measures the effect of TM operator based on the HDR image only with coding distortion and the mixed distorted image after TM. Experimental results show that the objective prediction of the proposed method is better compared some representative method and more consistent with users’ visual perception.

 Multimodal Representations for Teacher-Guided Compositional Visual Reasoning  
  Neural Module Networks (NMN) are a compelling method for visual question answering, enabling the translation of a question into a program consisting of a series of reasoning sub-tasks that are sequentially executed on the image to produce an answer. NMNs provide enhanced explainability compared to integrated models, allowing for a better understanding of the underlying reasoning process. To improve the effectiveness of NMNs we propose to exploit features obtained by a large-scale cross-modal encoder. Also, the current training approach of NMNs relies on the propagation of module outputs to subsequent modules, leading to the accumulation of prediction errors and the generation of false answers. To mitigate this, we introduce an NMN learning strategy involving scheduled teacher guidance. Initially, the model is fully guided by the ground-truth intermediate outputs, but gradually transitions to an autonomous behavior as training progresses. This reduces error accumulation, thus improving training efficiency and final performance. We demonstrate that by incorporating cross-modal features and employing more effective training techniques for NMN, we achieve a favorable balance between performance and transparency in the reasoning process.
