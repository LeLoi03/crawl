 SEMANTICS 2023: 19th International Conference on Semantic Systems  
  21/Sep   
 International representatives from business and research organisations will gather this September, in Leipzig (Germany) for the 19th edition of SEMANTiCS and Language Intelligence 2023 conference, to exchange ideas on data and information management, artificial intelligence, and  
  digital transformation. Don’t miss out on this exceptional opportunity to be part of SEMANTiCS / Language Intelligence 2023, where the worlds of Knowledge Graphs, Multilingual Artificial Intelligence, and semantic technologies converge.  
  At SEMANTiCS researchers, industry experts and business leaders can develop a thorough understanding of trends and application scenarios in the fields of Machine Learning, Data Science, Linked Data and Natural Language Processing. Indeed, this edition will focus on the use of  
  knowledge graphs and artificial intelligence in semantic technologies. SEMANTiCS is organised in conjunction with LANGUAGE INTELLIGENCE 2023, which will showcase the latest developments in Multilingual Artificial Intelligence: speech interaction, deep meaning processing and multilingual communication and cognition. Both conferences will take place from September 20-22, 2023, at the Hyperion Hotel in Leipzig (Germany).  
  SEMANTiCS has a longstanding reputation for bridging the gap between academic research and practical industry applications, creating an environment where ideas flourish, and knowledge is shared. By changing venues between Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands, SEMANTiCS ensures the Semantic Web community across Europe can unite, collaborate, and shape the future of semantic technologies. Besides, the organising committee comprises a diverse pool of members from different countries: Germany, the USA, Italy, Spain, the UK, Austria, and the Netherlands. In an exciting collaboration, SEMANTiCS has integrated the program of the Language Intelligence 2023 conference, enriching the event with the presence of leading experts in the field of language intelligence. This convergence is crucial to foster an interdisciplinary environment, facilitating the exchange of ideas and knowledge across diverse domains.  
  SEMANTiCS / Language Intelligence 2023 invites professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts from around the world to gather in Leipzig (Germany). This esteemed event offers a unique opportunity to engage with international experts in artificial intelligence, data and information management, and foundation models. We are happy to bring domain experts to Leipzig (Germany) from all over the world.

 ACM SenSys  
 The ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems (SenSys) introduces a highly selective, single-track forum for research on systems issues of sensors and sensor-enabled smart systems, broadly defined. Systems of smart sensors will revolutionize a wide array of application areas by providing an unprecedented density and fidelity of instrumentation. They also present various systems challenges because of resource constraints, uncertainty, irregularity, mobility, and scale. This conference provides an ideal venue to address research challenges facing the design, development, deployment, use, and fundamental limits of these systems. Sensing systems require contributions from many fields, from wireless communication and networking, embedded systems and hardware, energy harvesting and management, distributed systems and algorithms, data management, and applications, so we welcome cross-disciplinary work.  
 SenSys the leading conference for research on systems of networked sensing and actuation. It is jointly sponsored by ACM SIGCOMM, SIGMOBILE, SIGARCH, SIGOPS, SIGMETRICS, and SIGBED.
