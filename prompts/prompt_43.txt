 Design of System for Chinese Sign Language Corpus Construction Peng Jin 1,2,a  , Yi Liu 3,b  , Xueqiang Lv 1  and Siyuan Jing 2,3   
 ABSTRACT  
 One of the factors that hinder the development of sign language recognition and translation is the absence of large-scale corpus of sign language. However, construction of a large corpus with hundreds of thousands of sign language sentences as well as the aligned videos, annotations, skeleton etc., is not a simple task without the support of a system. In this paper, we introduce a system for management of construction of large-scale corpuses of Chinese sign language. The process of construction includes four steps, which are original data collection, gloss transcription, video record and video annotation. For each step, an operation of quality check is required. Moreover, some intelligent techniques are exploited to facilitate the management of corpus construction, such as text similarity identification, gloss word retrieval, and so on. The details of the system design and crucial techniques are explained in the paper. We hope the proposed system can promote the development of large-scale sign language construction as well as the recognition and translation of sign language.  
 Keywords:  Sign language, Pattern recognition, Machine translation, Corpus, System design.

 CLEI 2023: Towards an integrated and cross-cutting vision of Cybersecurity in LATAM  
 Published by admin   on 20/12/2023  20/12/2023   
 It is a satellite event on Cybersecurity, to be held in the framework of the Latin American Conference of Informatics, organised in alliance between the Latin American Centre for Informatics Studies (CLEI) and the Network of Excellence in Cybersecurity in Latin America and the Caribbean (Red CiberLaC), with the support of the Inter-American Development Bank  .  
 The cross-cutting nature of cybersecurity requires its treatment from management, teaching, research, training and awareness and practice. This is why this event aims to generate a broad exchange of knowledge and experiences, but, above all, to be a meeting place.  
 The event was held with the participation of renowned actors in the field of cybersecurity from academia, government and industry, as well as international organisations in the region. It also seeks to disseminate different relevant topics on cybersecurity, and to give visibility to the progress and development needs of the region in this field.  
 Presentations were given covering different aspects of cybersecurity. In the morning, individual presentations were given by renowned researchers in the field of public key infrastructure (PKI) and digital signatures, cybersecurity training platforms and post-quantum cryptography. In the afternoon, there were panels covering aspects of governance, interaction with civil society, standards and government cybersecurity policies.

 The International Conference on Cloud Computing and Services Science (CLOSER), focuses on the highly important area of Cloud Computing, inspired by some latest advances that concern the infrastructure, operations, and available services through the global network. Further, the conference considers as essential the link to Services Science, acknowledging the service-orientation in most current IT-driven collaborations. The conference is nevertheless not about the union of these two (already broad) fields, but about Cloud Computing where we are also interested in how Services Science can provide theory, methods and techniques to design, analyze, manage, market and study various aspects of Cloud Computing.
