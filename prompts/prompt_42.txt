  Welcome Message of CISIS-2023 International Conference Organizers  
  Welcome to the 17th International Conference on Complex, Intelligent and Software Intensive Systems (CISIS-2023), which will be held from July 5 to July 7, 2023, in conjunction with the 17th International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing (IMIS 2023). The aim of the conference is to deliver a platform of scientific interaction between the three interwoven challenging areas of research and development of future ICT-enabled applications: software intensive systems, complex systems, and intelligent systems. Software intensive systems are systems, which heavily interact with other systems, sensors, actuators, devices, other software systems, and users. More and more domains are involved with software intensive systems, e.g., automotive, telecommunication systems, embedded systems in general, industrial automation systems, and business applications. Moreover, the outcome of Web services delivers a new platform for enabling software intensive systems. The conference is thus focused on tools, practically relevant, and theoretical foundations for engineering software intensive systems. Complex systems research is focused on the overall understanding of systems rather than its components. Complex systems are very much characterized by the changing environments in which they act by their multiple internal and external interactions. They evolve and adapt through internal and external dynamic interactions. The development of intelligent systems and agents, which is each time more characterized by the use of ontologies and their logical foundations build a fruitful impulse for both software intensive systems and complex systems. Recent research in the field of intelligent systems, robotics, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and cognitive sciences are very important factors for the future development and innovation of software intensive and complex systems. This conference is aiming at delivering a forum for in-depth scientific discussions among the three communities. The papers included in the proceedings cover all aspects of theory, design, and application of complex systems, intelligent systems, and software intensive systems. We are very proud and honored to have two distinguished keynote talks by Dr. Salvatore Venticinque, University of Campania “Luigi Vanvitelli”, Italy, and Prof. Sanjay Kumar Dhurandher, Netaji Subhas University of Technology, India, who will present their recent work and will give new insights and ideas to the conference participants. The organization of an International Conference requires the support and help of many people. A lot of people have helped and worked hard to produce a successful technical program and conference proceedings. First, we would like to thank all authors for submitting their papers, the Program Committee Members, and the reviewers who carried out the most difficult work by carefully evaluating the submitted papers. We are grateful to Honorary Chair Prof. Makoto Takizawa, Hosei University, Japan, for his guidance and support.

  Evolution of Intelligent Software Agents  
  Salvatore Venticinque University of Campania “Luigi Vanvitelli”, Caserta, Italy Abstract. The talk will focus on the evolution of models, techniques, technologies, and applications of software agents in the last years. Rapidly evolving areas of software agents range from programming paradigms to artificial intelligence. Driven by different motivations, an heterogeneous body of research is carried out under this banner. In each research area, the acceptance of agents has always been at once critical or skeptical and enthusiastic for promising future opportunities. Nevertheless, the efforts have been continuously spent to advance the research in this field. One example is the semantic Web vision, whereby machine-readable Web data could be automatically actioned upon by intelligent software Web agents. Maybe it has yet to be realized; however, semantic enrichment of Web metadata of digital archives is constantly growing including links to domain vocabularies and ontologies by supporting more and more advanced reasoning.

  Abstract. Quantum computing is a rapidly growing ﬁeld of computing that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to signiﬁcantly speed up computations that are beyond the capabilities of classical computing. This type of computing can revolutionize the ﬁeld of trustworthy artiﬁcial intelligence, where decision-making is data-driven, complex, and time-consuming. Diﬀerent trust-based AI systems have been proposed for diﬀerent AI applications. In this paper, we have reviewed diﬀerent trustbased AI systems and summarized their alternative quantum algorithms. This review provides an overview of quantum algorithms for three trustbased AI applications: fake user detection in social networks, medical diagnostic system, and ﬁnding the shortest path used in social network trust aggregation.

  3.2.2 Quantum Support Vector Machine The quantum support vector machine algorithm performs the least square-SVM using a quantum computer [29]. This quantum algorithm uses phase estimation and a quantum matrix inversion algorithm to maximize the algorithm’s speed. Considering there are N data points (xi , yi ): i = 1, 2.....N), where xi is the feature vector, and yi is the binary label of the data, the goal of the SVM is to ﬁnd the hyperplane w.x + b = 0 that divides the data points into two categories. The quantum least square SVM algorithm calculates the kernel matrix using the quantum random access memory [10] and solves the linear equation using the quantum algorithm for solving linear equations and then performs classiﬁcation using the trained qubits. Following are the steps of the quantum support vector machine algorithm. Algorithm 3. Quantum Support Vector Machine Input: Training Data and Test Data Output: Classiﬁcation: +1 or -1 Procedure: Step 1: Calculate the kernel metrics using the quantum inner product algorithm [24]. Step 2: Solve the linear equation using the quantum algorithm for linear equations [10]. Step 3: Classify the test data using the training results, using a quantum algorithm [29].  
  The complexity of the quantum SVM algorithm is O(logN M ) as compared to the traditional SVM, which has the complexity of O(M 2 (M + N )). Here N is the N-dimensional feature vector, and M is the number of data points. 3.2.3 Traditional Logistic Regression Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm widely used for classiﬁcation tasks. This algorithm classiﬁes observations into a discrete set of classes. Logistic regression predicts the probability of an event occurring based on a set of independent variables or predictors. The algorithm models the relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a logistic function, which produces an S-shaped curve [21]. This logistic function transforms the linear combination of input variables and coeﬃcients into a probability value of 0 and 1. The logistic regression algorithm minimizes the diﬀerence between the predicted probabilities and the actual output in the training data by ﬁnding the optimal values for the coeﬃcients. Logistic regression is widely used in many ﬁelds, including healthcare, ﬁnance, and social sciences. It has many advantages: it can handle categorical and continuous variables as input features. However, this algorithm does not perform well if there is a non-linear relationship between the input and output variables and is time-consuming when applied to big datasets. 3.2.4 Quantum Logistic Regression Logistic regression is an important algorithm used for classiﬁcation tasks. But this algorithm can be slow for large data sets as it involves a gradient descent

  Abstract. In order to realize distributed applications, conﬂicting transactions are required to be serializable. The Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) is widespread to not only improve the concurrency of transactions but also serialize transactions. The Multi-Version Timestamp Ordering (MVTO) algorithm is one of algorithms to realize the MVCC. However, the MVTO algorithm does not consider the electric energy consumption of servers to perform transactions. In this paper, the Energy-Saving Multi-Version Timestamp Ordering with Virtual Machines (ESMVTO-VM) algorithm is newly proposed to not only improve the concurrency of transactions but also decrease the electric energy consumption of a cluster of servers which are equipped with virtual machines without performing meaningless write methods. In evaluation, we show the ESMVTO-VM algorithm can decrease the electric energy consumption of a cluster of servers than the MVTO algorithm.

  initiated to utilize provided application services. Therefore, a scalable and high performance computing system like a cloud computing system [2] is required to provide application services. A cloud computing system is composed of a cluster of physical servers. Virtual machines are equipped with each physical server to eﬃciently utilize the computation resources of the server. Objects are deployed to virtual machines in a server cluster. Conﬂicting transactions issued by users have to be serialized [6–10] to maintain consistency among objects. The Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) [8,9] is so far proposed to serialize conﬂicting transactions based on the “read data from” relation [8,9]. The latest committed version of each object is read by each read method in the MVCC. Therefore, each read method conﬂicts with neither any read nor write methods on diﬀerent resources. Hence, the concurrency of transactions can be improved. The Multi-Version Timestamp Ordering (MVTO) algorithm [8,9] is one of algorithms to realize the MVCC. However, reduction of electric energy consumption of servers to perform methods on each object is not considered in the MVTO algorithm. In a server cluster, not only performance of a system but also reduction of electric energy consumed by servers have to be considered as discussed in Green computing [3–5,11]. In this paper, the Energy-Saving Multi-Version Timestamp Ordering with Virtual Machines (ESMVTO-VM) algorithm based on the MVTO algorithm is newly proposed to decrease the electric energy consumption of a server cluster equipped with virtual machines without performing meaningless write methods [11] on each object. We evaluate the ESMVTO-VM algorithm compared with the MVTO algorithm. In evaluation, we show the electric energy consumed by servers can be decreased in the ESMVTO-VM algorithm than the MVTO algorithm. The system model of this paper is presented in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3, we newly propose the ESMVTO-VM algorithm. Evaluation results of the ESMVTO-VM algorithm are shown in Sect. 4.

  A method opi locally precedes another method opj (opi →mvSh opj ) in a local multi-version schedule mvSh of an object oh iﬀ opi →mvS opj . [Absorption] A write method opj is absorbed by another full write method opi in a local schedule mvSh iﬀ one of the following conditions holds: 1. opj →mvSh opi and there is no read method op such that opj →mvSh op →mvSh opi . 2. opi absorbs op and op absorbs opj for some method op . A pair of multi-version schedules mvS 1 and mvS 2 are equivalent iﬀ the same state is obtained by mvS 1 and mvS 2 for every state in the system. A write method w is meaningless iﬀ a multi-version schedule mvS 1 is equivalent to another multi-version schedule mvS 2 even if the write method w is removed from mvS 1 . [Meaningless Write Methods] A write method w is meaningless on an object oh iﬀ the write method w is absorbed by another full write method f w in the local schedule mvSh . In this paper, the Energy-Saving Multi-Version Timestamp Ordering in Virtual Machine environment (ESMVTO-VM) algorithm is newly proposed based on the MVTO algorithm [8,9] to decrease the TPE consumption of a server cluster without performing meaningless write methods. A method opi issued by a transaction T i is performed on an object oh by ESMVTO-VM algorithm shown in Algorithm 1. A variable oh .wcheck shows a write method wtj (djh ) issued by a transaction T j . A write method wtj (djh ) shown by oh .wcheck waits for performing until a method op to be performed just after the write method wtj (djh ) is received by the object oh . If the write method wtj (djh ) shown by oh .wcheck is absorbed by the method op , the method op is performed on the object oh without performing the write method wtj (djh ). The TPE consumption of a server cluster can decrease in the ESMVTOVM algorithm without performing meaningless write methods on each object. The ESMVTO-VM algorithm can also reduce the execution time of each transaction than the MVTO algorithm since each transaction can commit without performing meaningless write methods.

  Towards a Blockchain-Based Crowdsourcing Method for Robotic Ontology Evolution Wafa Alharbi1,2(B) and Farookh Khadeer Hussain1 1 School of Computer Science, University of Technology, Sydney, NSW, Australia [email protected]  , [email protected]  , [email protected]  2 College of Computer Science and Information Technology, Shaqra University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia  
  Abstract. All domain knowledge may change over time due to the addition or updating of new concepts, rules or requirements, especially when the domain is in its infancy such as robotics. This mandates the need to evolve the corresponding ontologies. In this paper, we propose a new blockchain-based robotic ontology evolution method using a crowdsourcing approach. The proposed method integrates the use of a crowdsourcing approach to allow a crowd of robotic experts to evolve the ontology and then use blockchain as a storage mechanism to store and manage the different versions of the ontology. We aim to solve some of the issues emanating from the methods proposed in the literature, such as preventing manipulation in ontologies, accessing different versions of ontologies, and involving a good number of domain experts in proposing changes and seeking their approval. Keywords: Crowdsourcing · Blockchain · Ontology · Ontology Evolution  
  W. Alharbi and F. K. Hussain  
  A key issue with ontology is the evolution of ontologies [4]. As domain knowledge changes overtime, it necessitates a change in the corresponding domain ontology. Unfortunately, a number of ontologies are static in nature, in the sense that once engineered, they are unable to evolve or change over time to accommodate the new (or in some instances changed) knowledge. This has given rise to the notion of ‘ontology evolution’. Crowdsourcing has been proposed as one of the approaches to enable ontology evolution [5]. In the crowdsourcing method, a requester identifies a set of tasks that have to be undertaken and the crowd voluntarily undertakes these tasks. We apply the concept of crowdsourcing to evolve robotics ontology, where the crowd (robotic expert community) is involved in improving or updating the robotic ontology. Using approaches such as crowdsourcing for ontology evolution will result in ontology transitioning from a static semantic body of knowledge to a dynamic semantic body of knowledge. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: in Sect. 2, we review some of the methods proposed in the literature. In Sect. 3, we discuss our proposed approach, crowdsourcing blockchain-based robotic ontology evolution. In Sect. 4, we illustrate an example of the proposed method and we conclude the work in Sect. 5.  
  2 Ontology Evolution Related Work Ontology evolution is necessary when an expert’s perception of domain knowledge changes over time. Hence, there is a need for the corresponding domain ontology to evolve. When reading through the existing literature on ontology evolution, it is observed that the studies in this field can be classified into three main groups: the first group proposes ontology evolution methods; the second group focuses on storing and versioning the ontology changes without paying any attention to the ontology evolution methodologies; and the third group measures the impact of ontology evolution on dependent applications which is not in the scope of this study. Many studies have proposed new methodologies for ontology evolution. One of the proposed methods to enable ontology evolution is “Ontology Evolution Wiki” which is based on the crowdsourcing technique of Wikipedia, where different community users are involved in the evolution of ontologies by proposing changes/updates and discussing them with domain experts until reaching an agreement [6]. In a similar vein, the proposed method in [5] employed the use of a crowdsourcing technique to allow learners in an online learning environment to contribute to ontology generation and evolution. This approach has been tested on three learning activities: a semantic annotation activity, a knowledge graph activity, and a reverse quiz activity. In [7], the authors presented a semantic navigation support service and tool for ontology evolution called OntoAssist. It evolves a base ontology by aggregating knowledge from a large number of actual web users.  
  23  
  Other studies in the literature tried to solve the issue of ontology history access. [8] proposed a method to manage and simplify the versioning of an ontology by storing all the evolved versions of an ontology in a rational database. This involves identifying all types of primitive operations that are used to evolve an ontology and identifying each version of the ontology with a unique timestamp. Then, any version of the ontology can be manipulated, reconstructed or retrieved using SQL queries. In a similar premise, [9] proposed a hybrid approach which also used rational databases to store ontology versions. In their approach, they tried to build a space-efficient storage strategy that keeps a complete history of ontology evolution by capturing the semantics of a domain using a predefined reference version and the most recent version of the ontology. A formal framework was developed by [10] to track the changes in an ontology by assigning a timestamp to each version of the ontology. The framework then takes two states of an ontology as input and returns a description of the changes. The framework treats the ontology changes in four levels: concepts, concepts’ relations, instances and their relations. In robotics domain, there are number of ontologies that have been built in the literature. Some of these works employ ontologies to support robot capabilities in the working environment by defining a conceptualization of all instructions and situations of the required task [11], while other studies built ontologies for technical terminologies of robots and robot parts [12]. For instance, an IEEE standard ontology termed as “Core Ontology for Robotics and Automation (CORA)” is developed in [13], that ontology describes the physical design of robots and it is currently being used to build other robotic ontologies that cover other robotic sub-domains. The authors of [14] built a domain ontology that is designed to facilitate humanrobot collaboration by considering three contexts: the Environment, the Behavior and the Production contexts. However, none of these works discussed how to evolve the proposed robotic ontologies. In this paper, we are aiming to address the limitations in the current ontology evolution methods such as: 1. All robotic ontologies in the literature are static. We aim to allow robotic ontology evolution to change the nature of robotic ontologies to be dynamic ontologies. 2. There is no automated method to recover the previous version of the ontology before applying the changes [4].

  5 Conclusion In this paper, we proposed a new method for robotic ontology evolution. The proposed method is based on using the crowdsourcing method that engages a community of robotic experts and robotic users to participate in proposing changes in ontologies. It also integrates the use of blockchain as the platform for proposing changes and seeking their approval (via a consensus vote). The approved changed will then be manually made to the ontology by the robotic experts. The robotic experts participate in the voting process for each proposed change. Once a community member makes a change to the ontology, this change will not be added to the chain until it has been approved by the majority of experts, then it will be added as a block at the end of the ontology chain. Using blockchain as a storage mechanism has numerous benefits: the immutability feature of blockchain ensures the stored ontologies are secure and the transparency of blockchain allows reliable and trusted old versions of ontologies to be accessed.  
  Abstract. In this paper, we present the performance of a Dynamic Thresholdbased Anti-packet Generation (DTAG) method for Delay-/Disruption-/Disconnection-Tolerant Networking (DTN) considering a real road map scenario. We imported road data around Kagoshima central station, which is located in South Kyushu region in Japan. We considered the combination of DTAG method and anti-packet with Epidemic protocol. Based on the simulation results, we observed that the combination of the proposed DTAG method with the Epidemic protocol reduces overhead regardless the number of nodes.

  In this paper, we present the performance of the proposed DTAG method combined with Epidemic protocol considering a real road map scenario. For evaluation, we considered a road model around Kagashima central staion in Japan. Based on the simulation results, we observed that the combination of the proposed DTAG method with the Epidemic protocol reduces overhead regardless the number of nodes. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the contact-based DTN protocols. In Sect. 3, we explain the approach for combining the DTAG method with the Epidemic protocol. The simulation scenario and results are presented in Sect. 4. The paper concludes with Sect. 5.  
  2 Contact-Based DTN Protocols The Epidemic protocol involves sending a group of messages along with two control messages throughout the network. To keep track of the messages stored by each node, a Summary Vector (SV) is periodically distributed by every node. The SV is checked by nodes against their stored data, and in case an unknown bundle message is detected, the node generates a REQUEST. However, the constant copying and storing of bundle messages by nodes to their neighbors poses a significant challenge to network resources and storage capacity. The copied bundle messages may remain in the storage even after being received by destinations and being deleted too late by recovery methods such as anti-packet. Typical anti-packets are transmitted by destinations and contain a list of bundles received. Nodes are able to delete the messages from their storage once they have been verified and distributed the anti-packet to other nodes. However, anti-packets may have adverse effects on network resources.  
  3 Combination of DTAG Method with Epidemic Protocol We combine the proposed DTAG Method with Epidemic protocol. The flowchart of the proposed DTAG method is illustrated in Fig. 1. The method has a procedure for handling received messages, including SVs, REQUESTs, MESSAGEs and anti-packets. The DTAG approach generates anti-packets at intermediate nodes before the bundle messages reach their destination. To calculate the number of new and identical messages, the node counts the received SVs without any predetermined threshold in the DTAG procedure. If the result of Eq. (1) is true, the DTAG method generates an anti-packet. Otherwise, if Eq. (1) is false, the message is stored in the node’s storage. Count New Msgs Count Same Msgs ≥ , (Count New Msgs and All Msgs = 0). (1) Count All Msgs Count All Msgs  
  situation reversed towards the end of the duration as the vehicle density increased. This is because the number of messages increased with more vehicles, and some vehicles were unable to receive anti-packets, leading to an increase in storage usage.  
  5 Conclusions In this paper, we have presented the performance evaluation of the proposed DTAG method combined with Epidemic protocol considering a real-world road map scenario. Specifically, we considered the road model around Kagoshima central station in Japan and implemented two scenarios by combining the proposed DTAG method and conventional anti-packet method with Epidemic protocol. We conducted simulations to evaluate the implemented scenarios. Based on the simulation results, we observed that the combination of the proposed DTAG method with Epidemic protocol reduces overhead regardless the number of nodes. In future work, we plan to explore other recovery methods and evaluate other parameters to improve the performance of proposed approach.

  Abstract. Various types of devices are scalably interconnected in addition to computers like servers in the IoT (Internet of Things) and the IoT consumes large electric energy. In the FC (Fog Computing) model of the IoT, application processes for calculating on sensor data from devices are executed on both servers and fog nodes. The TBFC (Tree-Based FC) model is proposed to reduce the total energy consumption of the IoT. The FTBFC (Flexible TBFC) model is also proposed, where operations for changing the tree structure. In this paper, a DC (Dynamical Change) algorithm is newly proposed to change the FTBFC model where a node is changed each time the node is congested Here, the tree structure and processes supported by nodes are changed to reduce the total energy consumption. In the evaluation, the total energy consumption of the IoT is shown to be reduced in the DC algorithm. Keywords: Green computing · FTBFC model · IoT (FC) model · DC algorithm · Energy consumption

  with the child nodes and parent node. Each node receives data from the child nodes. The node then processes the data and sends the processed data to the parent node. The FTTBFC (Fault-Tolerant TBFC) model [22–24] is proposed to be tolerant of node faults. In addition to node faults, traﬃc of sensor data is ﬂuctuated. In order to adapt to the ﬂuctuation of sensor data, the DTBFC (Dynamic TBFC) model [18,24] is proposed. Processes supported by a node f are changed to reduce the energy consumption of congested nodes. In the TBFC model, nodes with which each node can communicate are ﬁxed. In the NFC (network FC) model [25], each fog node f negotiates with another fog node g on whether or not g can process data sent by f . Operations to change the tree are proposed In the FTBFC (Flexible TBFC) model [16]. A DC (Dynamic Change) algorithm is newly proposed in this paper, by which parent-child relations and processes of nodes are changed each time more data units are queued in the nodes. The total energy consumption is shown to be reduced in the DC algorithm in the evaluation. In Sect. 2, we present the FTBFC model. In Sect. 3, we propose the DC algorithm. In Sect. 4, we evaluate the DC algorithm.  
  2 2.1  
  Change Operations  
  If some node fI is congested, fI is a point of energy consumption bottleneck. Here, if some input DUs of fI are sent to another node, the energy consumption of fI gets smaller since the node fI receives and calculates on smaller amount of input DUs. Each node fI has a receipt queue RQIi to receive input DUs from each child node fIi (1 ≤ i ≤ bI ). qlIi shows the length, i.e. number of input DUs  bI of a receipt queue RQIi . The total queue length qlI is the total number i=1 qlIi of input DUs in the receipt queues RQI1 , . . ., RQIbI . In this paper, a node fI is referred to as more congested than another node fJ (fI > fJ ) if qlI > qlJ . For a process sequence P = p1 , . . . , pm , suppose a node fI supports a process subsequence PI = ptI , ptI +1 , . . ., plI  and its child node fIi supports a subsequence PIi = ptIi , ptIi +1 , . . ., plIi . Here, plI +1 = ptIi . For every pair of child nodes pIi and pIj , the top processes ptIi and ptIj are the same while the tail processes plI and plI may not be the same. In order to change the tree T , we consider the following change operations on a node fI for changing the tree structure and making the process migrate  
  An Energy-Aware Dynamic Algorithm for the FTBFC Model of the IoT  
  Abstract. A Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) is expected to be used for temporary networks during disasters and networks for IoT devices in factories since it can provide a stable wireless sensor network over a wide area. Since the placement of mesh routers has a significant impact on the overall WMN communication, a mesh router placement problem is defined to decide efficient mesh router placement. In our previous work, we proposed various optimization methods for the mesh router placement optimization problem. However, these methods may result in a dense placement of mesh routers. Therefore, by spreading the interval between mesh routers, it is possible to spread the range that can be covered by the mesh routers in the entire subject area. In this paper, we propose an optimization method for mesh router placement considering electric field strength with the Finite Difference Time Domain Method (FDTD). We carried out some simulations and from the simulation results, the Area Ratio of Strong Electric field (ARSE) increases about 3 [%] by the proposed method from we proposed optimization methods in our previous work.  
  router placement optimization problem is defined to decide efficient placement of mesh routers [4–8]. We previously proposed the Coverage Construction Method (CCM) [9], CCMbased Hill Climbing (HC) [10] and CCM-based Simulated Annealing (SA) [11] to solve the problem. In the mesh router placement optimization problem, the main objective functions are the Size of Giant Component (SGC), which indicates network connectivity and the Number of Covered Mesh Clients (NCMC), which indicates the number of mesh clients within the communication range of the mesh routers. However, these methods may results in a dense placement of mesh routers and even if the clients can be covered, the range in which the entire subject area can be communicated may be narrow range. By spreading the interval between mesh routers, it is possible to expand the range that can be covered by the mesh routers in the entire subject area. Therefore, we consider applying radio wave propagation by electromagnetic waves analysis to improve these proposed methods. There is the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method [12–17] as a method for electromagnetic waves analysis. The FDTD method divides the space into a mesh of small rectangular or cubic elements called cells and uses an updated formula formulated based on Faraday’s law and Ampere’s law. The electromagnetic field of each cell is successively updated at each time according to the updating formula formulated based on Faraday’s law and Ampere’s law. In this paper, we propose a CCM and SA based FDTD approach as an optimization method for the placement of mesh routers considering the coverage area of the electric field strength. Also, we perform simulations to evaluate the proposed method. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we present an overview of the proposed system. In Sect. 3, we show the simulation results. Finally, in Sect. 4, we conclude the paper.  
  2 Proposed Method Figure 1 shows the image of the proposed method. The proposed method that the CCM and SA expansive approach based on radio propagation analysis by FDTD method decides the optimal placement of mesh routers considering the electric field strength. The electric field strength is derived through FDTD based radio propagation analysis. Also, the method optimizes the placement of the mesh routers to maximize the stable communication range in the considered area. 2.1 CCM The CCM [9] is a method that derives a solution to maximize SGC in the mesh routers optimization problem. One coordinate is randomly decided and a mesh router is placed. Then again the one coordinate is randomly decided and a mesh router is placed. Each mesh router considers the radio communication ranges as a circle and collision detection is performed between two mesh routers and repeated until the radio communication ranges overlap. The generated mesh router is detected for collision with the previously generated mesh routers. The new mesh router is generated when any of the mesh routers  
  Fig. 1. Image of the proposed method.  
  have overlapping radio communication ranges. This process is continued until the number of mesh routers has been set. This process is repeated and the solution with the highest NCMC among generated solutions is the final solution for CCM. 2.2  
  CCM-Based SA  
  The CCM-based SA [11] derives the optimal solution by performing SA to the placement of mesh routers derived by CCM. The SA is the nearest neighbour search method that enables escape from local solutions by neighbourhood search and the state transition by random selection. Also, SA updates the solution according to the state transition probability (STP) which consists of the solution evaluation and temperature. In CCMbased SA, one mesh router is randomly selected and moved place. When the SGC is maximum, the NCMC derives and updates the placement of mesh routers if the NCMC is increasing. If the NCMC is decreased or un-updated, the placement of mesh routers is updated according to STP. This process is repeated in any number of iterations and derives the placement of mesh routers which is the results of the final iteration as the optimal solution.  
  A CCM, SA and FDTD Based Mesh Router Placement Optimization in WMN  
  The proposed method set the simulation area as an open area and the second-order Mur Absorbing Boundary Condition (ABC) in the Mur ABC [18]. The Mur ABC is the one type of artificial boundary to limit the computational area in the numerical simulation of waves. Also, the Mur ABC include the first-order Mur ABC that considers only the perpendicular incident waves and the second-order Mur ABC also considers the oblique incident waves. The FDTD method applies ABC after performing electric field calculations and performs magnetic field calculations. By repeating this process for multiple time steps, we can simulate the behavior of electromagnetic waves. We consider two factors to evaluate the stability of wireless communication: one is the Area Ratio of Strong Electric field (ARSE) and the other is the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of the mesh routers Communication Range Overlap Point (CROP). The ARSE derives from the rate of area numbers with electric field strength above any value. The RSSI derives from the Average Electric Fields Strength (AEFS) at CROP of the mesh routers. The AEFS is calculated by taking the average of electric field strength for each time step in each area. In the proposed method, the mesh routers placement is decided by CCM-based SA as the initial solution and derives the RSSI in each CROP. The electric field strength of the CROP and the AEFS in the simulation area calculates by the FDTD method. One CROP with an AEFS significantly different from the target value selects randomly within the list of CROPs. One of the mesh router comprising the selected CROP is moved to a neighbourhood. The target value set a number that stabilizes communication between the mesh routers. If the SGC and NCMC are not maximized when the mesh router is moved, the placement of the mesh routers is returned to the placement before the move. Also, the CROP and the AEFS with the mesh routers moved are derived by the FDTD method. When the mesh router is moved, if the AEFS of CROP is close to the target value or ARSE increases, the current solution is updated. This process is repeated in any number of iterations and derives the placement of mesh routers which is the results of the final iteration as the optimal solution.

The residual power energy can be used for additional energy for regional area, such as electric power supply for EV car and automotive EV bus services. Furthermore, in case of blackout by disaster, VPP can provide the emergency power supply even the general power facilities are out of order. Thus, VPP can perform local production for local power consumption. In this paper, the communication network protocol to realize the distributed VP in regional area are discussed. In the followings, the related works with VPP are introduced in section two. Then system configuration of power system with VPP is discussed in the section three. Next, communication protocol architecture among distributed VPP to monitor supply and demand and control the energy balance is explained in section four. After that, as example of VPP use case, geographically distributed DERS in local area is considered in section five. Finally, the concluding remarks of consideration and discussion of this research direction and future works are described in section six.

  A University timetabling problem entails that a set of courses is to be delivered to a group of students over a term or semester which is divided into a set of days, with each day divided into a set of time slots which can be referred to as a period. This group of students is called student group. A student group can be assigned the same course by the same lecturer in the given period and room. The other basic entities of the problem are the courses to be scheduled, the rooms available for the allocation of courses and teachers to deliver the lecture. The basic requirements of a timetable include: • Lecture constraint (LC): a unique course must be assigned in a room at distinct periods. • Room constraint (RC): not all rooms can be assigned to all courses; some may require lab or seminar halls and capacity of the room must be optimally utilised. • Order constraint (OC): there may be some order of preference for some courses. • Room occupancy (RO): at most one lecture can be assigned to each room in a period. • Conflict Constraint (CC): the student group should not be assigned with more than one activity during the same period. The above-mentioned constraints which should not be violated in the scheduling process are called hard constraints. The objective of the University Course Timetabling Problem (UCTP) is to develop a timetable which satisfies all LC, RC, OC, RO and CC by minimizing the penalty which are the weights assigned on violation of the soft constraints like: • Room Capacity: when the room capacity is less than the size of the student group assigned leading to under utilization. • Room stability: Total number of distinct rooms assigned. The present research considers all the basic requirements of a timetabling problem and incorporates additional constraints such as • Courses which require specific rooms like lab sessions • Class sessions with different time duration. The model solves timetabling problems and are amenable for extra constraints if any. The rest of the sections of the paper is presented as follows: Sect. 2 summarizes review of literature, Sect. 3 explains the Course Timetabling Problem (CTP), Sect. 4 elaborates the implementation and outcome of the proposed algorithm, and finally, Sect. 5 ends with conclusion.  
  2 Literature Review We focus only on literature related to course and timetable scheduling in educational institutions. Linear programming, Genetic algorithms, heuristic approach etc. has gained wide popularity. Integer Programming Classroom scheduling is formulated as a LP model in Nakasuwan et al. [10]. The formulation objective is reducing the cost of scheduling the class where weights are penalty of  
  3 Problem Description This part of the paper describes the proposed model for optimization of university class scheduling. Class scheduling problem is based on the following key components: (1) number of days in a week, (2) number of working hours in a day, (3) number of courses,  
  S. M. Buhari and J. Manoj  
  and (4) number of rooms and room types available. This work aims to assign classes to respective student groups and classrooms based on time, with due contribution towards the objective and constraints. Consideration is also given for objectives or constraints that could conflict each other. The vast problem of scheduling the entire term of a university is broken down into two stages: (1) Weekly lecture allocation, and (2) Creating schedule. This will help simplify the task and the solution to be more comprehensible. Weekly schedule is to be obtained with the objective of optimizing the resource utilization. Furthermore, the results could be further optimized. Evaluation of the proposed approach is based on two main factors: (1) quality of the solution, and (2) algorithmic time complexity. These two-evaluation metrics also bring in trade-offs, thus obtaining a perfect solution could be impossible. The University Class Scheduling problem considered in this study can be explained as follows. The scheduling is planned on for a term and weekly schedule is to be prepared. Resources that are to be allocated are teachers and classrooms, assuming that all classrooms are equally equipped with ICT and other requirements. Once the students decide the courses or programme for study, term wise schedule is to be provided. A group of students who have opted for a programme is referred to as student group, there is no restriction on the size of the student group. The duration of each class hour is constant, one hour for a lecture and two hours for a lab session. All other activities are also of one-hour duration. General Elements Any university class scheduling problem considers certain basic parameters like time, room, courses, students etc. (1) Time: Times indicate the number of weeks considered in a term, number of days within a week and the number of time slots per day. (2) Rooms: Rooms available for course allocation might vary on size, facilities, and time. Certain rooms like seminar hall or lecture theatre must be allocated for certain meetings, which occur at specific times during the week. (3) Courses: Courses might be structured in such a way that students are required to attend all offerings, whether a lab or lecture, of a specific course within a week. (4) Students: Students are grouped as student groups based on their term of study. The number of students per group will determine the number of sections required per course. Constraints Constraints can be classified as soft and hard constraints [23, 24]. The four basic parameters used in this research are total number of time slots, number of activities, number of student group and number of resources of different type available. Let the institution have np total number of time slots where p refers to the time period which will be engaged with na number of activities, where a being a specific activity which have ns number of student groups where s represents different student group. The two resources considered ri refers to rooms and teachers and let nri be the number of resource available of type i. The hard constraints formulate the optimization parameters and are thus required to be satisfied. Not satisfying soft constraints will affect the quality of the solution.  
  Solving University Course Scheduling  
  The hard or required constraints include: (1) Resource Related: In general, resources like rooms might vary in their capacities. Resource usage could be evaluated in terms of resource frequency (ratio of the number of used time periods over available time periods) and resource utilization (ratio of used to available resources considered over all the available time periods). i. The resources must be optimum utilized. Resource utilization cannot exceed a certain limit but must be utilized above a minimum. Instructors might have load limits on certain number of lectures/workload in a week [InstructorWorkload]. ii. Every resource will have single booking at any point of time. a. A classroom can accommodate only one lecture at a time [RoomOccupancy]. b. An instructor can teach only one class at a time [InstructorTeach]. (2) Activity Related: i. All activities must happen at least once in a week [WeeklyOnce]. ii. Activity must be assigned according to a chosen order. iii. Some courses might need to be offered at the same time [CourseOverlap]. iv. Every student and every resource may only have one activity booked at a time [OneAtATime]. v. Activities have varied duration & required resource [VariedAspects]. Soft constraints include: Based on student requirements: Student workload should be as even as possible; Daily workload must not violate the restrictions [StudentWorkload]. Certain number of breaks should be there in a day. There should not be gap between the schedules in the daily meetings of a course, i.e., two-hour lecture should be continuous. Notation Definition

  Notations used for Formulation of the Problem In order to formalize the given problem, certain notations are required. Terms for courses: Here, the decision is made with regards to which courses are offered in a specific term. Two options exist: (1) fixed courses per term, and (2) dynamically allocated due to resource [rooms, instructors, etc.] constraints. If the number of courses per term is fixed, there is no need for this process.

  3.2 Arabic Sentiment Benchmark Datasets This paper conducts experiments using seven Arabic benchmark datasets written in Egyptian dialects and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). Moreover, it demonstrates the adaptability of our model across diverse domains. We have used two sentiment classes,  
  Structured Data  
  Structured data includes basic customer information, which can be used to extract additional derived features for the prediction models. This data is obtained from customers’ entered personal information on the company’s web page. Often, some customers may enter oﬀensive words which do not indicate buying intent. We also identify the relationships between diﬀerent data categories to increase the number and quality of features. Various analytical methods are used to analyze the structured data as follows. 1. Oﬀensive Word Detection We use databases containing words that are commonly regarded as oﬀensive to identify the potentially inappropriate language in customer proﬁles. Users who include such terms in their proﬁles may be deemed non-genuine or not serious, potentially lowering the chances of successful transactions. 2. Name Entity Recognition Providing a real name, brand, or product represents the desired shopping needs of a customer, thus signiﬁcantly improving the probability that the user is a purchaser. We utilize the most widely used NER (Name Entity Recognition) System [18] to determine whether the description contains a real name, brand, etc., to determine the likelihood that the user will be a purchaser. This approach is also used for unstructured data.  
  J. Ning et al.  
  3. Phone Number and Email Address Check Often, many data items have the same phone number, which could result from a massive cyber attack. In other scenarios, hackers may ﬁll in the same email address to increase the platform’s workload. These users are meaningless to the business, so they have the lowest priority. 4. Correlation between Phone Number and City Suppose the area code in the phone number matches the city entered by the user. In that case, it indicates that the user’s information is relatively reliable, which can be used to judge whether the user will become a purchaser. 5. Reasonability of Budget Comparing the budget and priority vehicle type ﬁlled in by a user can serve as a reference to determine whether the customer has the ﬁnancial ability to make a potential purchase. 2.2  
  Unstructured Data  
  J. Ning et al.  
  SVM works by optimizing the separation between classes using hyperplanes [15]. However, its traditional form prioritizes accuracy and may not be suitable for cost-sensitive requirements [14]. This is where a weighted SVM comes into play. Weighted SVM is a cost-sensitive version of SVM that assigns different weights to each class based on their relative importance. The weighted SVM algorithm can prioritize speciﬁc categories and increase the penalty for false negatives within those categories. This helps to ensure that every potential customer is given appropriate consideration and is not overlooked due to a misclassiﬁcation. By implementing a weighted SVM approach, e-commerce platforms can reduce the occurrence of false negatives and improve the prediction model’s performance. The kernel is the mathematical function that determines how support vector machines operate. The kernel’s role is to process the input data to the desired format. Diﬀerent SVM algorithm uses diﬀerent type of kernel, such as linear, nonlinear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid [16]. Our model uses the polynomial kernel as it has demonstrated better prediction results in our experiments. The formula of the polynomial kernel is: K(X1 , X2 ) = (a + XT1 X2 )b

  Abstract. Trust is used as the foundation for decision-making in many situations. Therefore, the concept of trust is attracting attention in various research fields. Emotional trust is one of the essential aspects of the trust. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy-based system for assessment of emotional trust considering three parameters: Expectation (Ex), Willingness (Wi) and Attitude (At). We evaluate the proposed system by simulations. The simulation results show that when Ex, Wi and At are increasing, the ET parameter is increased.

  Digital environments should consider trust concept. For example, the trust concept is adopted to 5G and beyond networks to provide security guarantees and quantiﬁes how much a system can be trusted to maintain a speciﬁc level of performance. Also, the trustworthy in Cloud, Fog and Edge computing is important for deducing the risk of a transaction and preventing data and privacy leakage [2–5]. In this paper, we propose a Fuzzy-based system for assessment of emotional trust considering three parameters: Expectation (Ex), Willingness (Wi) and Attitude (At). We evaluate the proposed system by simulations. The simulation results show that when Ex, Wi and At are increasing, the ET parameter is increased. The rest of the paper is constructed into the following sections. In Sect. 2 is presented an overview of Trust Computing. In Sect. 3, we present Fuzzy Logic. In Sect. 4, we describe Proposed Fuzzy-based System. In Sect. 5, we describe the simulation results. In Sect. 6, we give conclusions and future work.

  Trust Computing  
  The digital data and devices are increasing every day and allow sensors, smart phones and other devices to communicate with each other. When diverse devices connect with each other, the physical and social environments are integrated with the digital world [1]. The information exchange via the digital world has a strong impact on the society. Thus, digital exchanges need to be more secure and trustworthy. Integrating of digital, social, and physical worlds bring new and more complex vulnerabilities. Thus, the authenticated access control and security protocols may be unfeasible. Also, malicious entities can cause many problems and issues in digital networks. Therefore, the trust computing is a very good approach. Trust computing is a social concept used for interaction between people and entities. Considering the social properties of trust into the digital world, the digital entities can perceive others and choose their interactions, the same as in the real world. The trust computing is very diﬃcult to be quantiﬁed and the perception mechanisms of physical and social world are not available to be implemented in digital environments. Therefore, trust modelling can be used for evaluation and decision-making in real life problems [1].  
  Fuzzy Logic Overview  
  An Fuzzy Logic (FL) system is capable of handling linguistic information and numerical data independently and can perform nonlinear mapping of the input data vector into the scalar output. In addition, it can handle opinions or demands that may be true, untrue or have a middle level of the truth value. The FL systems are implemented in several controlling applications, including TV picture correction, Sendai subway running, and airplane control (Rockwell Corp. (Sony) [7,8]. Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) structure consists of four components: Fuzziﬁer, Inference Engine, Fuzzy Rule Base and Defuzziﬁer as shown in Fig. 3. In the ﬁrst phase, the Fuzziﬁer combines crisp values with linguistic variables associated with fuzzy sets to generate fuzzy inputs. Then, the Inference Engine uses fuzziﬁed input values and fuzzy rules for inferring fuzziﬁed output. Three diﬀerent kinds of fuzzy inference techniques are typically employed: Sugeno, Mamdani, and Tsukamoto fuzzy inference. The fuzzy rules could be provided by a professional or derived from numerical data. Finally, Defuzziﬁcation convert a fuzziﬁed output into a crisp control output [9,10].

  Proposed Fuzzy-Based System  
  In this paper, we use FL to implement the proposed system. The proposed system is called Fuzzy-based System for Assessment of Emotional Trust (FSAET). The structure of FSAET is shown in Fig. 4. For the implementation of our system, we consider three input parameters: Expectation (Ex), Willingness (Wi), Attitude (At) and the output parameter is Emotional Trust (ET).  
  Fig. 4. Proposed system structure.  
  Conclusions and Future Work  
  In this paper, we proposed and implemented a Fuzzy-based system for assessment of emotion trust. We evaluated the proposed system by simulations. From the simulation results, we found that three parameters have diﬀerent eﬀects on the ET. When Ex, Wi and At are increasing, the ET parameter is increased. In the future, we will consider other parameters and make extensive simulations to evaluate the proposed system.  
  Exploratory Landscape Analysis and Sampling  
  Exploratory landscape analysis [12] is a family of techniques that analyze the objective and solution (search) spaces of a problem. They construct features that are estimated from discrete points sampled over the continuous problem landscapes. The main purpose of diﬀerent sampling strategies is to systematically generate a set of discrete problem solutions for which the values of the ﬁtness function(s) and other important problem properties will be evaluated. A wide range of sampling methods has been introduced to obtain points and ﬁtness values that allow eﬃcient and accurate characterization of the underlying problem. They are used to scatter the samples across the ﬁtness landscape in diﬀerent ways. The features computed from the samples can be diﬀerent, as ˇ demonstrated for single-objective problems by Reanu et al. [13] and Skvorc et al. [15]. In this paper, we focus on bi-objective problems and investigate diﬀerent sampling strategies from various points of view including, e.g., the provision of features that enable accurate problem classiﬁcation and sensitivity to problem dimension and the number of samples. The following 5 sampling strategies were considered. Uniform random sampling (Uniform) is the standard sampling method that uses a pseudorandom generator with a uniform probability distribution to generate the solutions. Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) generates near-random samples by dividing multi-dimensional spaces into a square grid and selecting one sample from each grid cell [11]. An optimized variant of LHS, LHSO, uses random permutation of coordinates to improve the space ﬁlling robustness and lower the centered discrepancy. Sobol’s sequence-based sampling (Sobol) utilizes the Sobol’s low-discrepancy sequence. It is a quasi-random sequence with base 2  
  P. Kr¨ omer and V. Uher  
  that binarily represents the position of each dimension [16]. It uses a linear matrix scramble with digital random shifting to improve the discrepancy (i.e., the space-ﬁlling properties) of the sequence. Halton’s sequence-based sampling (G-Halton) is a strategy built upon the generalized Halton’s sequence with coprime integers as its bases [4]. Figure 1 illustrates the diﬀerent space-ﬁlling properties of two sampling strategies, Uniform and LHSO. It clearly displays that various patterns occur among the sampled points and the density of samples generated by the methods varies in diﬀerent areas of the search space. It visually conﬁrms that diﬀerent sampling strategies result in diﬀerent views of the ﬁtness landscapes due to under- or oversampling of some regions.

The lower triangle shows the densities of the points in every cell of the corresponding (10 × 10) grid.  
  Eﬃcient FPGA Implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network for Surgical Image Segmentation Focusing on Recursive Structure Takehiro Miura, Shuto Abe, Taito Manabe, Yuichiro Shibata(B) , Taiichiro Kosaka, and Tomohiko Adachi Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan [email protected]   
  Abstract. This paper discusses FPGA implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for surgical image segmentation, which is part of a project to develop an automatic endoscope manipulation robot for laparoscopic surgery. From a viewpoint of hardware design, the major challenge to be addressed is that simple parallel implementation with spatial expansion requires a huge amount of FPGA resources. To cope with this problem, we propose a highly eﬃcient implementation approach focusing on the recursive structure of the proposed network. Experimental results showed that the dominant computing resources could be reduced by about half in exchange for a 6% increase in memory resources and a 0.01% increase in latency. It was also observed that the operations performed on the network itself did not change, keeping the same inference results and throughput.

  Convolution Layer  
  The network mainly consists of three small networks. Figure 2 shows each shape. The ﬁlter sizes are all 3 × 3, and padding is performed in each layer to keep the input and output sizes the same. The activation function is the Leaky ReLU [6]: f (x) = max(ax, x), where a = 0.25. ReLU, which is often used as the activation function for general neural networks, outputs 0 for any negative input, and negative numbers with large absolute values may appear in the middle of operations as learning progresses [7]. Since this implementation uses ﬁxed-point numbers for hardware, this phenomenon leads to an increase in the bit width required for arithmetic operations and a decrease in arithmetic precision. Leaky ReLU, on the other hand, has a non-zero weight even in the negative region, which mitigates this problem. For the value of a, we adopted a = 0.25 = 2−2 , which can be implemented simply by a bit shift operation.  
  Resource Usage  
  The resource usage is summarized in Fig. 16. The results demonstrate that the application of the proposed method reduced the amount of dominant computational resources (LUT, FF, and CARRY8) to about half. Although there is an increase of about 6% in memory resources due to the additional delay buﬀers, their utilization is small and acceptable compared to the other resources. The required number of FPGA chips are also reduced from 7 to 3, which is beneﬁcial in terms of cost and portability.

  Proposed Network Models  
  Based on the YOLOv3-tiny, we designed the following variant models introducing depthwise separable convolution and grouped convolution. • Tiny-sep model In this model, depthwise separable convolution was applied to all 3 × 3 convolution layers except the ﬁrst layer in the YOLOv3-tiny. • Tiny-sep-grouped model In this model, both depthwise separable convolution and grouped convolution were applied, aiming at reducing the computational costs of pointwise (1 × 1) convolution in the tiny-sep model. To avoid loss of accuracy, grouped convolution was applied to the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, and 12th convolution layers rather than all pointwise convolution layers. Three numbers of groups (G) were compared: 2, 4, and 8. • Tiny-grouped model For comparison, only grouped convolution was applied to the original YOLOv3-tiny in this model. The target layers are the same as the abovementioned tiny-sep-grouped model. Also, three numbers of G were compared: 2, 4, and 8. Hereafter, the original YOLOv3-tiny is referred to simply as the tiny model. The evaluated models and their sizes are listed in Table 1. Table 1. Compared models and their sizes Model Name

  found to be more dominant than that of depthwise convolution, and this trend is more pronounced for layers with a large number of channels. The suppressive eﬀect of the gropued convolution on tiny-sep models suggests that TensorRT CUDA kernels allow 3 × 3 ﬁlters to be more eﬃciently computed, probably due to the SIMD characteristics of the GPU architecture. Regarding the grouped convolution, as shown in Fig. 4, the tiny model shows a greater reduction in processing time than the tiny-sep model thanks to the introduction of grouped convolution. The tiny-sep model did not beneﬁt from the increase in the number of groups. The grouped convolution is performed for 3 × 3 ﬁlters in the tiny model, while the grouped convolution is applied to the pointwise convolution of 1 × 1 ﬁlters in the tiny-sep model.

  take better decisions. Some of these technologies include vehicular navigation, camera and image processing to monitor vehicle speed, vehicle detection, security and accident detection, smart toll payments, weather information, detection of traﬃc signal control and rules violation, and so on. Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) is a relevant component of ITS, which enhance the safety and eﬃciency in transportation systems. In VANETs, the vehicles are able to interact with the environment by communicating with the infrastructure and other nearby vehicles. Moreover, diﬀerent artiﬁcial intelligent approaches including Fuzzy Logic (FL) are used to make better predictions in these systems. In a previous work [1], we proposed an intelligent system based on FL that evaluated the driver’s stress as one the most important factors that leads to accident. The driver’s stress was determined based on driver’s impatience signs, the dangerous behavior of other nearby drivers and traﬃc condition. In this work, we take into consideration internal factors that can make drivers take a wrong decision. Such factors include recognition error caused by internal and external distractions, decision error which happens by a wrong decision taken consciously, and performance error which is the improper physical response done unintentionally, as the most important ones. We evaluate the proposed system by computer simulations. Based on the output value, the proposed system can determine whether the driver poses a risk for himself and other road users. The structure of the paper is as follows. In Sect. 2, we present an overview of VANETs and its evolution from traditional to cloud-fog-edge SDN-VANETs. Section 2 we describe in detail the combination of two emerging technologies that are SDN and VANETs, and the advantages this combination brings. In Sect. 4, we describe the proposed fuzzy-based system and its implementation. In Sect. 5, we discuss the simulation results. Finally, conclusions and future work are given in Sect. 6.

  Abstract. In this paper, we consider three intelligent algorithms: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Hill Climbing (HC) and Distributed Genetic Algorithm (DGA), and implement a new hybrid intelligent system for Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) called WMN-PSOHCDGA. For distribution of mesh clients, we consider Subway distribution and we carry out simulations for different instances (different scales) of WMNs. We compare the simulation results of a Fast Convergence Rational Decrement of Vmax Method (FC-RDVM) with Random Inertia Weight Method (RIWM). By simulation results, we found that FC-RDVM performs better than RIWM for load balancing and middle scale WMNs.  
  node placement problem [1, 3, 7, 8]. In [9, 10], we implemented intelligent simulations systems for WMNs considering simple heruistic algorithms. In this paper, we present a new hybrid intelligent system for Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) called WMN-PSOHCDGA, which integrates three intelligent algorithms: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Hill Climbing (HC) and Distributed Genetic Algorithm (DGA). We compare the results of a Fast Convergence Rational Decrement of Vmax Method (FC-RDVM) with Random Inertia Weight Method (RIWM) considering Subway distribution of mesh clients and different instances (different scales of WMNs). The simulation results show that FC-RDVM has better performance and load balancing than RIWM for middle scale WMNs. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we introduce intelligent algorithms. In Sect. 3, we present the implemented hybrid simulation system. The simulation results are given in Sect. 4. Finally, we give conclusions and future work in Sect. 5.  
  2 Intelligent Algorithms 2.1 Particle Swarm Optimization The PSO is a local search algorithm, which considers particles swarm for optimization process. The particles in the swarm move according to some rules considering the previous and the best known position. The PSO algorithm generates the initial positions of particles in random way and after every iteration the position and velocity of each particle is changed in order to move towards the desired location. The acceleration coefficients are weighting in order to improve the efficiency of local search and convergence to the global optimum solution. 2.2 Hill Climbing Algorithm The HC algorithm is also a local search algorithm, which can find the best solution from a set of possible solutions. The HC algorithm is easily implemented and is used for different optimization problems. The HC algorithm can find quickly the local optima, but sometime it can get stuck in local optima and may not find the global optimum. The performance of HC algorithm depends on initial solution, so a good initial solution is needed. 2.3 Genetic Algorithm Genetic Algorithm (GA) searches through a population of individuals and can operate on different representations. The main GA operators are Selection, Crossover and Mutation. The GA is successfully applied to different optimization problems, but it is computationally expensive and time-consuming. In our research work, we use Distributed GA (DGA), which has an additional mechanism to escape from local optima by considering multiple islands.  
  Abstract. Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) are a popular technology due to their numerous advantages, but they have some issues that are related with wireless communication. Node placement is a critical factor in addressing these issues, but optimizing the placement of mesh routers is a complex problem that falls under the category of NP-hard problems. To tackle this problem, we propose a system for node placement problem in WMNs based on a metaheuristic algorithm called Cuckoo Search (CS). We call this system WMN-CS. We evaluated the proposed system by computer simulations considering Normal Distribution and Uniform distribution of mesh clients. The simulation results show that the proposed system can achieve good results for Normal distribution of mesh clients. For Uniform distribution, we need to add more mesh routers to cover all mesh clients. But this increases the cost of WMN.

  The rest of this paper is organised as follows. In Sect. 2, we brifly introduce the related works. The mesh router nodes placement problem is defined in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4, we present CS algorithm. The proposed simulation system is discussed in Sect. 5. Simulation results are presented in Sect. 6, followed by our conclusions and suggestions for future work in Sect. 7.  
  2 Related Works Many researchers have investigated to solve the node placement problem, resource allocation, node selection, and routing problems which are essential for the future of WMNs [1, 14]. There rae many solutions to solve these problems, including mixedinteger linear programming (MILP)-based optimization models and heuristic-based methods such as Hill Climbing (HC), Simulated Annealing (SA), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) [5, 6, 8–11, 13]. Heuristic-based methods are commonly used to solve NP-hard problems and are more time-efficient than MILP-based methods [15]. Many proposed solutions for WMNs are evaluated based on simulation results. Heuristic-based methods are promising approaches for solving the node placement problem in WMNs and other related issues [16].

  We define the fitness function as: Fitness = 𝛼 × SGC(𝒙, 𝒚, 𝒓) + 𝛽 × NCMC(𝒙, 𝒚, 𝒓). The fitness function in WMN-CS is a combination of two metrics: the Size of the Giant Component (SGC) and the Number of Covered Mesh Clients (NCMC). Both of which are calculated from WMN graph using vectors 𝒙, 𝒚, and 𝒓 representing the positions and communication distances of mesh nodes. The SGC measures the connectivity of mesh routers, while NCMC measures the user coverage. The fitness function includes weight coefficients 𝛼 and 𝛽 to balance the contributions of SGC and NCMC, respectively. WMN-CS can generate different mesh clients distributions. In this paper, we consider Normal and Uniform distribution of mesh clients as shown in Fig. 2. The Normal  
  Abstract. The recent emergence of open-source medical cyber-physical systems has rapidly transformed the healthcare industry. This can be attributed to advancements in 3D printing technology and the growing popularity of open-source microcomputer systems like Arduino and Raspberry Pi. However, the increased use of these systems in hospitals has also raised cybersecurity concerns. In particular, new technologies, such as IoT devices and other mobile devices, have posed new challenges in exploiting modern botnets and determining their effectiveness with limited resources. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and full-encrypted crossplatform botnet system that provides a proof-of-concept demonstration of how a botnet attack can block control flow from the syringe pump in a testbed of an IoT medical network. The emphasis is placed on minimal deployment time and resource usage, making this lightweight botnet different from most traditional botnets, thus furthering cybersecurity research in intrusion detection for open-source medical systems.  
  identified by a specific name. The name of the file is determined by the execution node when it issues the put command. This file can then be retrieved and executed by name using Python’s eval statement. The ping statement confirms that the bot server is still operational. Despite its name, this statement does not generate an ICMP echo request. Instead, it establishes a connection over the same socket for all other bot communication. When the bot receives this command, it dispatches a ping notification to the web server. It is important to keep track of the number of active bots at any given time. In addition, activity monitoring tools can assist the bot manager in identifying network connectivity problems or software issues. Currently, activity monitoring is carried out on-demand, meaning the execution node must issue a ping command. Furthermore, we need to ensure that malicious sources cannot commandeer our bots, so we require a method for our bots to authenticate the commands they receive. Each bot updates the control server whenever it starts up, performs an activity, or shuts down. For example, an activity is storing a file (in response to a put command), executing a file (in response to an exec command), or responding to a ping. The bot will transmit these notifications to the address specified in bot.conf . In addition, each notification includes the port number on which the bot server operates. When the control server receives these notifications, it will update the bot_status table to reflect the appropriate notification time, message, and port. When a bot receives communication through its listening socket, the first step is verifying the command. To verify the command, MD5 is used to hash the command, which is then transmitted through a GET request to the configured validate_addr. The MD5 command hash is sent as this request’s ‘command’ parameter. The web service checks the command_log table when the validated request is received. It computes the MD5 of all commands transmitted within the last 10 s. If the supplied hash is found among them, the value True will be transmitted in response to the bot. If not, False will be sent instead. This mechanism verifies both the origin of the command (i.e., the execution node) and the timeliness of the command.  
  Abstract. With the development of 5G communication technology, the construction of the electric power Internet of Things relying on new technologies such as cloud computing, big data, and artificial intelligence has promoted the data integration of various electric power systems to achieve resource sharing services. With the continuous access of mass terminals to the Internet of Things, the attendant security authentication issues are becoming increasingly prominent. The traditional password based or digital certificate based authentication methods can no longer meet the access control of mass power terminals to power servers. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a strong identity authentication scheme based on SM9 cryptographic algorithm for the power Internet of Things without digital certificates and passwords, providing an effective solution for using intelligent terminals to achieve identity authentication for power Internet of Things systems in the Internet environment. Keywords: SM9 algorithm · Internet of Things · Identity Authentication · Safety Certification  
  1 Introduction With the development of 5G communication technology, facing the access of a large number of mobile terminals in the electric power Internet of Things, various types of electric power operation data are collected and analyzed, and a large amount of fragmented data is collected and provided to the data center for management through different devices. With the increasing frequency of information interaction between power systems, the security of access agents affects the reliability of data and instructions, and the identity authentication technology of devices will also play an important role in increasingly complex network environments.  
  2 Identity Authentication Technology Traditional identity authentication methods mainly include passwords, tokens, and cliometrics. In recent years, in order to improve the security of identity authentication, researchers have made various improvements to identity authentication schemes, ranging from multifactor and public key cryptography and more biometric schemes [1, 2]. In order to resist various attacks and solve problems such as key escrow, these schemes typically employ a third-party (CA) certification authority [3]. However, these schemes require creating a digital certificate for each terminal and establishing a key management center to provide key generation and storage for the authentication process [4]. At the same time, these schemes require the exchange of a large number of digital certificates, placing a heavy burden on the authentication management system. Therefore, lightweight and convenient identity authentication mechanisms have become one of the important research directions. With the vigorous promotion of domestic cryptographic algorithms, there has been more research on identity authentication schemes based on the national secret algorithm. Scheme [5] proposes a Kerberos identity authentication protocol based on the national secret algorithm, which requires a third-party (CA) authentication authority. Due to the fact that the State Security SM9 algorithm can implement identity authentication schemes without digital certificates, and has the advantages of flexibility, scalability, and simplicity compared to traditional PKI, SM9-based identity authentication schemes have attracted the attention of researchers. Scheme [6] proposes a distributed identity authentication scheme for distribution networks based on the SM9 algorithm, which can effectively achieve distributed control of power grid system identity authentication and has strong security. Scheme [7] proposes a mobile internet identity authentication scheme based on the SM9 algorithm, which can effectively resist replay attacks, phishing attacks, intelligent device loss, and other attacks, providing a direction for implementing strong identity authentication schemes in the mobile internet environment. Based on the research of Scheme 4, combined with the advantages of existing 5G technology and SM9 algorithm, this scheme proposes a strong authentication scheme suitable for network access the Electric Power Internet of Things, providing an effective solution for Internet of Things.  
  3 SM9 Algorithm As a type of identity password, the public and private keys of National Secret SM9 are calculated by the Key Generation Centre (KGC) using the device identity, master key, master private key, and public algorithm parameters. It mainly uses various unique identifiers as public keys for data encryption and identity authentication, which is very suitable for e-mail protection, secure circulation of official documents, service and client security communication, identity authentication Applications such as Internet of Things security communication and cloud data protection have natural password delegation functions, which are very suitable for supervised electric-power application environments. They also have great advantages in monitoring the interconnection equipment of various duty stations [8].

Otherwise, calculate t2 = s · t1(−1) and dA = t2 · P1 , dA as the user’s signature private key, QA = H1 (IDA hid , N ) · P2 + Ppuk as the public key to verify the signature. (3) Signature Generation For a message M ∈ {0, 1}∗ to be signed, signer A can digitally sign message M by following the steps below. ➀ Randomly generating a random number r ∈ [1, N − 1]. ➁ Calculating the elements ω = gr in a group GT . ➂ Calculate an integer number h = H2 (Mω, N). ➃ Calculate an integer number ξ = (r − h) mod N. if ξ = 0 then return to step ➀. ➄ Calculating the elements S = ξ · dA in a group G1 . ➅ Output the digital signature σ = (h, S) of message M. (4) Signature Verification Given the signature message M ∈ {0, 1}∗ and σ = (h , S ), recipient B performs the following operation to verify the validity of the signature σ = (h , S ) of message M . ➀ Calculating the element t = gh in a group GT . ➁ Calculate an integer number h1 = H1 (IDA hid , N ). ➂ Calculate the element P = h1 · P2 + Ppuk in the group G2 . ➃ Calculate the elements π = e(S , P) and ϕ = π · t in the group GT . ➄ Calculate the integer number h2 = H2 (M ϕ , N) and then check h2 = h whether it is true. If it is true, the verification passes, otherwise the verification fails.  
  4 Strong Identity Authentication Scheme for the Power Network Based on SM9 Encryption Algorithm In the context of the power network, SM9 algorithm can easily achieve user authentication. However, due to the management of private keys on the user side, there is a significant potential for theft. Once the private key is leaked, it will pose a significant threat to the access verification of the power network. In order to prevent the risk of key theft, at terminals connected to the power network, additional biometric identification devices that support fingerprint, voice, pupil, face, and other biometric identification are added to obtain user ID information, achieving strong “password free” identity authentication for users, and improving the security of accessing the power network system. 4.1 Scheme Design The scheme is divided into a power terminal and a power server. The power terminal is responsible for collecting legitimate user biological information, such as fingerprints, faces, voice prints, etc., generating user unique identifiers, and storing user private keys. The server is mainly composed of KGC, Identity Authentication System (AS), Registration Center(RS) and cloud DB to achieve key generation.  
  decryption and verification have passed, thereby obtaining IDA , QA , RA1 and RAi of user A. ➂ Verify those IDA , QA and RA1 of user A in the terminal registry are equal to these IDA , QA and RA1 of user A. If not, the authentication of user A is rejected. ➃ The server provides the authenticated user A with access rights or corresponding resources based on the preset user permissions, and replaces RAi with RA1 in the registry. After the user passes the authentication, perform the calculation dA = dA ⊕ H1 (IDA ||RAi ) and replace dA with dA as important information for the next identity authentication request. 4.2.4 Key Negotiation After the identity authentication between the user and the server, the public and private key pairs generated by the SM9 algorithm can be used to achieve information ciphertext and transmission, or the random number used for authentication can be used as the symmetric encryption key for temporary sessions. The one-time encryption method can also ensure the security of the transmitted information.

The properties of bilinear pairs are: ➀ ∀P1 , P2 ∈ G1 , Q ∈ G2 , there is a conclusion that e(P1 + P2 , Q) = e(P1 , Q) · e(P2 , Q). ➁ ∀Q1 , Q2 ∈ G2 , P ∈ G1 , there is a conclusion that e(P, Q1 + Q2 ) = e(P, Q1 ) · e(P, Q2 ). ➂ For any number α, β ∈ [1, N − 1], ∀P ∈ G1 ,Q ∈ G2 , there is a conclusion that e(α · P, β · Q) = e(P, Q)α·β = e(β · P, Q)α = e(P, α · Q)β = e(β · P, α · Q).

  Abstract. Machine learning algorithms play an important role in resource management, allowing the improvement of the efficiency of resource usage in data centers (DCs) by predicting workload trends. In this paper, we propose a simplified system to predict the CPU usage of virtual machines (VMs) in a DC using Linear Regression Models while performing VM clustering based on common statistical characteristics of VM time series, which facilitates grouping VMs with similar behaviors and establishing clusters based on these characteristics. For each cluster, three representative VMs are established based on the time series of the closest VM to the cluster centroid, averaged time series for the cluster, and concatenated time series. Then, training of representative VMs is performed to finally choose the one with the lowest mean error per cluster. Simulation results show that, by performing clustering and training the model with representative time series, it is indeed possible to obtain a low mean error while reducing the local training time per VM. Keywords: Clustering · Data Center · Machine Learning · Time series · Prediction  
  However, there are risks associated with trying to manage a large number of VMs. Thus, one critical task is to detect, identify, and generate alerts regarding anomalous events of VMs in DC to avoid any malfunctioning of other users’ VMs [9]. Virtual Machine (VM) dynamic deployment is one key technique for virtual resource management enabling the prediction of the resources used by the virtual machine and managing them accordingly. Virtual Machine resource dynamic deployment focuses on the fine-grained resource adjustment strategy. Therefore, there is a need of predicting the usage of resources for the virtual machine to avoid delays or over/underprovisioning. Time series prediction models can be used for these predictions because the VM resources are dependent on time. Various types of resources such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk read times, disk write times, and network usage are predicted using the above models. In the literature, some approaches have been proposed to predict one metric or several metrics of interest based on the dataset. Moreover, it is possible to take preventive actions with these predictions. Based on these predictions, the warning rules can be improved in case of new unexpected events and the thresholds of the previously established metrics can be also adjusted [17]. This motivates our work to analyze historical data logs to predict CPU consumption. In this paper, we propose to analyze several traditional machine learning models along with clustering techniques that can improve the prediction of a preferred metric (e.g. CPU usage). Using statistical characteristics of VM’s time series and applying Kmeans clustering, we determine the clusters of VM with similar performance. Then, we select the best ML prediction models for the time series of different proposed types of representative VM belonging to a cluster. Owing to the fact that several VMs may have very similar behavior due to the services they run, we propose to evaluate clustering methods for VM before selecting the prediction model for any virtual machine. Thus, it is possible to use a single prediction model per cluster and to void the computational effort of performing the learning process for every single VM within clusters. Moreover, we propose to analyze several linear regression models along with k-means clustering techniques that can improve the prediction of CPU usage. In the event that a new virtual machine is created in the data center, it should be added to the cluster with similar characteristics in terms of the mean and standard deviation of CPU usage and the mean and standard deviation of memory usage. In addition, the training process needs to be performed again if the VM modifies the time series for the representative VMs and the new best representative VM should be determined for the cluster. The main contributions of this paper are: • A clustering algorithm for virtual machines in a DC together with a mechanism to determine three representative VMs per cluster for monitoring and predicting the CPU usage. • An evaluation of various linear regression prediction models and the selection of the most appropriate for each cluster based on the root mean square error. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the related work taking into account the prediction of computational workloads in DCs. Section 3 describes the proposed model to predict CPU usage based on the clustering of VMs. In Sect. 4,  
  numerical results are presented using the dataset. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes our work and proposes future work.  
  2 Related Work One of the most important challenges in DC is the efficient usage of computing resources in order to increase available resources and improve resource utilization. For this reason, this has been investigated using machine learning methods for DC resource consumption predictions[4]. In this section, we briefly present some time series based predictive models that can be found in the literature. There have been many efforts to predict DC resource utilization based on time series solutions with several purposes: i) to assign computing resources to each job based on the resource availability [5], to share the resources between multiple different cluster computing frameworks [11], to improve the resource utilization [12, 23] and to retain the quality of SLAs [14]. Other approaches focused only on the CPU consumption prediction using time series such as in DC [16]. For example, AWS forecast offers 6 types of forecast models which include both the classic time series models based on moving average and machine learning models. The prominent forecasting models used are: Prophet[6], ARIMA [13, 24], SARIMA [18], moving average [15], exponential smoothing, and recurrent neural networks[2]. Linear regression models were used to predict CPU consumption at the host level in [8] to solve task over/under loading. In addition, a VM migration mechanism is proposed to reduce the average SLA violations compared to threshold-based migration plans. [25] proposes the use of auto-correlations of time series to characterize VM resource usage as input for a neural network to predict of peak consumption providing an online updating module to monitor the predictions errors of the workload changes. Classical time series models and neural networks have been explored for short and long-term horizons. For instance, the performance of LSTM and SARIMA models were compared using Azure cloud dataset [18]. Artificial Neural Network was also used with historical data and tested on real-world datasets [3], and a performance comparison was presented with the existing classical time forecasting methods. In [10], the authors used Multivariate LSTM models to predict the future workload. In [19], deep belief networks are used to predict the resources extracting high-level features from the workload time series. The performance of several prediction models of CPU usage using time series was compared in [20]. These models are Holt-Winters, ARIMA, and LSTMs and it was shown that Holt-Winters presents less precision due to the lack of stationary and tendency in the data of CPU usage while ARIMA does not make a good prediction in real time if the dataset is long and LSTM model presented the best performance and lowest RMSE. To the best of our knowledge, the idea of combining historical data from several VMs with similar behavior has not been yet investigated. This can reduce the required training time for each individual VMs and enable the resource management system to cope with real-time decisions to improve the resource utilization of DCs.  
  CPU Usage Prediction Model: A Simplified VM Clustering Approach

  5 Conclusions In this paper, we propose a system that consists of 3 stages: clustering of the virtual machines based on its own information (i.e. time series), evaluating several Linear Regression algorithms using the common features of VM time series such as the mean CPU and memory usage, standard deviation of CPU and memory usage and its length. This makes it easier to group VMs with similar behavior and establish clusters based on these features. Then, the training of the 3 representative models is performed to finally choose the one with the best results in each cluster. We conclude that the representative models allow the system to reduce the training of each individual VM while minimizing the prediction error for any VM in a given cluster. In future work, we want to evaluate more ML algorithms to see if it is possible to further reduce training times and cluster stability under dynamic workload changes in the DC.  
  An Adaptive Virtual Node Management Method for Overlay Networks Based on Multiple Time Intervals Tatsuya Kubo and Tomoya Kawakami(B) Graduate School of Engineering, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan [email protected]   
  Abstract. IoT, where the low cost of sensor devices is a background for widespread use, handles much information closely related to location and time. To handle large amounts of sensor data efficiently, the authors have proposed a method to treat queries efficiently, mainly focusing on time ties. In the previous study, we proposed a method to improve efficiency by virtualization and changing the routing algorithm, but the effect was limited. Moreover, it did not consider differences in device performance, which is a characteristic of existing P2P networks. In this paper, we propose a method for adaptively allocating virtual nodes (computers). In the proposed, each physical node independently determines the number of virtual nodes based on its performance and the target size for the entire network. Experiments demonstrate that it can allocate nodes according to the processing capacity of nodes.  
  Fig. 1. Concept of the interval query  
  functions to be added, but here we describe in detail the research focusing on the connection between the data and time, which is the basis of this paper [8]. Network user may requests multiple data under the condition of a specific time interval due to the temporal connection of the sensor data. Examples are “July temperature every year” or “Every Sunday power consumption.” Queries composed of such multiple queries are collectively called interval queries, and the outline is shown in Fig. 1. Interval queries are considered to be useful for big data and other uses such as obtaining statistical information from past data and making future predictions. In addition, we used node virtualization for load balancing [7]. The load-balancing method in Ref. [7] was all assumed to aim at equalizing the load and allocated the same number of virtual nodes to all nodes. However, P2P networks are not composed of a small number of servers under the control of an administrator, but a myriad of devices. Therefore, as a more realistic condition, we proposed a method for adaptively allocating virtual nodes. In the proposed method, each physical node independently determines the number of virtual nodes based on its performance and the target size for the entire network. The related work such as a Chord network and overlay networks based on multiple different time intervals is described in Sect. 2. The proposed method is described in Sect. 3, and its evaluation is summarized in Sect. 4. The discussion is described in Sect. 5, and the conclusions are presented in Sect. 6.  
  2 Related Work 2.1 Chord Chord overlay network has ring topology that makes algorithm easier [12]. Each node holds three types of route information: Successor, Predecessor, and Finger Table. Chord is known as the most representative algorithm of DHT and there are many related studies. For example, optimized for specific devices [13], extending the search to be performed on quadtrees and [14] generalized n-branch trees [1], allowing flexible selection of route tables [10], and hybrid networks combined with unstructured overlay networks [3].  
  Adaptation to Virtualization  
  2.3.1 Disadvantages of Virtualization The disadvantage of virtualization mentioned in the previous section is that the number of nodes on the network increases as a single physical node has multiple nodes. As the number of nodes increases, the size of the network grows, and the same query must be transmitted far beyond many nodes. Therefore, the overall number of hops for each query increases, and the total number of messages including relays also increases, which may increase the load on the entire network and the number of times each node forwards and replies to messages. In particular, since interval queries are always composed of multiple queries, the impact of an increase in the number of messages will be bigger, and countermeasures are necessary. 2.3.2 Improving Routing Efficiency To mitigate this, we optimized the routing assuming virtual nodes [9]. Specifically, we proposed a routing method in which the transfer destination candidates selected during query transfer are expanded not only to virtual nodes but also to physical nodes. When a virtual node receives a query, it does not immediately determine the forwarding destination from its routing information but performs routing according to all information from its virtual nodes.  
  An Adaptive Virtual Node Management Method for Overlay Networks  
  In this way, this method also adds the viewpoint from the higher-level physical node to the routing. In step 2, the virtual node only references its routing table and does not communicate with the outside. The processing to refer to the routing table increases, but it is not a big burden because it is the processing of O(n) and the routing table has a fixed number of elements. If the physical node wants to send a query in step 3 from the different virtual nodes in step1, it can process by the program itself. It completely bypasses the network and shortens the route. 2.4 More Realistic Load Balancing As in Sect. 2.2, where load balancing was performed by virtualizing nodes, load balancing methods in DHTs can be roughly divided into “optimization of node allocation,” “node virtualization,” and “popular data distribution” [4]. Optimization of node allocation is a static incorporated method into the network mechanism. It aims to equalize the load by eliminating bias in the keys, like using a hash function. For virtualization, in addition to the method which avoids overload by smoothing node placement in the key space, there is also a method that allows an arbitrary number of virtual nodes per physical node [2]. This makes physical nodes store data according to their resources and effectively use their performance.  
  3 Proposed Method 3.1 Overview The load-balancing methods addressed in the previous studies [7] were all assumed to aim at equalizing the load. Therefore, the research in Sect. 2.2 allocated the same number of virtual nodes to all nodes. However, P2P networks are not composed of a small number of servers under the control of an administrator, but a myriad of devices. Therefore, like servers, they are not systematically deployed to provide services, and the performance of each node differs in terms of computational processing power, network bandwidth, storage capacity, and so on. In other words, distributing the load evenly is not the same as distributing the load equally. Even if the load is evenly distributed, some physical nodes may become overloaded or, conversely, have too much performance. Therefore, as a more realistic condition, we assumed a case in which the performance of each physical node differs, and introduced the concept of varying the allocation for each physical node. In this case, the first problem is to determine the performance evaluation index. This problem is complex. For example, mobile terminals have finite power resources, unlike stationary terminals. Here we assume that the performance metric is simply expressed as the number of virtual nodes that can be held. A physical node joins the network with an estimate of the number of virtual nodes it can have, based on the processing performance and bandwidth. To avoid exceeding this limit, more virtual nodes are placed on high-performance physical nodes and fewer on low-performance physical nodes. This method is a simple dichotomization model but can adequately reflect performance in many cases. Thus, the number of virtual nodes that each physical node can have is  
  T. Kubo and T. Kawakami  
  maintained, but it cannot have nodes up to these entire numbers due to the overhead of having too many virtual nodes. Instead, the network is adjusted so that a target number of virtual nodes is on the network. 3.2  
  Virtual Node Management  
  Look-Ahead of Interval Query  
  The routing optimization shown in Sect. 2.3.2 was only aimed at preventing duplication of a single query in the forwarding path. However, an interval query consists of multiple consecutive queries. Although redundant communication within a single query has already been prevented, the same physical node may be responsible for the data again in subsequent queries, and redundant communication that has not been removed here may remain. We introduced a mechanism to look ahead across multiple queries to solve this. A summary is shown in Fig. 2. Figure 2 shows an interval query consisting of five queries, where the number indicates the key, i.e., the time. Assuming that the key is in hours, the query requests data every two hours. Suppose that virtual node A1 of physical

  5 Discussion The proposed method allocates a small number of nodes to low-performing nodes to avoid overloading them and a large number of nodes to high-performing nodes to increase their utilization, thus achieving the desired adaptive allocation of the number of virtual nodes. We examined several methods for rounding the number of nodes and found that flooring does not cause overloading but results in low node utilization, while ceiling tends to cause overloading but maintains high node utilization. Thus, there is a trade-off between node load and efficiency. The choice of method to use depends on the importance of the node’s performance indicators. In other words, if the performance indicator is only a reference that it is desirable to keep the load below this level in consideration of power efficiency and other factors, then the utilization efficiency should be increased. On the other hand, if the performance indicator is an absolute one that operation will be affected if the load exceeds this level, then priority should be given to reducing that. However, since the truncation method had some points where the utilization rate was lower than the existing method, it is not practical as it is and requires improvement by changing the criteria, etc. We also found a difference of about 10% between the target number of virtual nodes and the number of virtual nodes allocated by the rounding method. However, we think it is unnecessary to strictly match this target number of nodes to the target value. This is because Chord, the foundation of this method, is capable of routing O(log N) messages for N nodes, and a change in the number of nodes of about 10% is not expected to have a significant impact on performance. Therefore, we believe that the node performance indicators are more important. As an additional experiment, we measured the number of messages under the same conditions as in the previous study [9] with and without adaptive virtual node allocation, respectively. And we found a slight reduction in the number of messages, although the routing was unchanged. This is thought to be because of the routing optimization method of existing research described in the Sect. 2.3.2 became more effective due to the concentration of many virtual nodes on the high-performance node. This suggests that this method is also effective in reducing the load on the network, which is a significant advantage.  
  During the analysis, a map image which depicts the departure and destination ports is loaded. Yahoo! Maps was used in the analysis. The pixel size in the Euclidean space was considered as 1 in the computation. Dummy data were employed for the tidal currents, where (ux , uy ) = (−1.8, 0.2) [m/s], and the east and north directions were consistently positive for all coordinates owing to the simulation area being small in the Seto Inland Sea. The wave height was uniformly set to H = 1.5 [m] for all coordinates as dummy data. When searching for a potential route for the vessel, two paths are explored, one to the right and the other to the left, every time it maneuvers around an island. Hence, as the sailing distance increases and the obstacles between the departure and destination ports become more complex, an increasing number of potential paths will be searched. If some of the solutions diverge owing to obstacles or the vessel fails to reach the destination port altogether, or when a detour route is being investigated, the search may become protracted. Thus, an upper limit is established for the number of turns and solutions that do not converge or detours from the candidate optimal routes are excluded. In this simulation, when the number of turns reaches 30, the path is removed from the list of candidate shortest paths as an unsuitable path, and the next candidate path is sought. Figure 2 exhibits the simulation outcomes.

  2 Finding Insights: Methodology To gain insight into these changes and how to prepare for them, we conducted a survey of 17 literatures with the theme of the future of workplace, metaverse as a workplace, the digital office, the virtual office, and essentials things towards hybrid works. In addition, we also analyzed the transcript of an interview with three senior consultants of leading executive search firms, published in YouTube and as a podcast. We did so understand how they perceived the changing role of leaders, given that they assist organizations in identifying the metaverse as an office alternative.  
  3 Essentials Need for Metaverse as Future Workplace 3.1 Digital Global Leadership Global and digital leadership is an activity within cognitive competence that results in effective behavior that is effective in understanding digitalization prospects. Whereby they can carry out all their assignments with little to no obstacles due to the ease of digitalization. Each competent global leader will have a stronger instinct for managing relevant information, observing contextual signals, behaviors, and cultures, along with the capability to connect this information, resulting in a meaningful pattern. Global leaders can also develop a complex perception regarding their very own context of productivity. Global leaders differentiate between their work context and their work process, especially if a leader possesses the initiative to conduct change on a global scale. 3.2 Digital Ethics The digital environment carries specific challenges for building communication and socialization ethics, which are then referred to as ‘digital work ethics’. As expected, we cannot easily convert the similarity between work ethics in the offline environment and work ethics in the virtual environment. Digital ethics have been discussed many  
  Issues and Challenges When Metaverse Replaces the Workplace  
  A. Adhiatma et al.  
  5 Action List for Top Management Team The following actions must be taken by the top management team when creating the metaverse as a virtual workplace: a. Build shared understanding Shared understanding is an effort to create a similar understanding and perception among all individuals within an organization regarding the foundational philosophy of why the top management team creates the metaverse as an alternative. This is due to the possibility that not all departments within an organization are befitting of carrying out their work within a virtual space. This shared understanding can also prevent the presence of misleading information or jealousy. b. Build shared identity This social identity in a virtual environment is important. Identity is a tool to understand individual actions, thoughts, and even individual feelings when joining a community. This virtual identity engagement will be beneficial for an organization because, firstly, when members of the organizations interact, they will share positive behavioral elements such as affection, motivation, and attributes that can increase performance, such as collective efficacy and a higher degree of team potential. Second, each member of the organization will compare their input and output within the organization. This is what is called social comparison. Each individual will participate in a competition to adjust their engagement in comparison with other members of the team. As such, it is clear that engagement built upon a shared identity in the virtual community will increase organizational performance. c. Build Value Co-creation The third element that an organization requires to go fully virtual or hybrid is ensuring that each individual holds the same values. This value is not the sum of each individual’s values, but rather a co-creation of values between leaders and members of the organization. In our previous research, we argued that value creation is the desired goal of the organization, to help it understand the needs of its members. If value can be created, then this effort will support rapid learning because experience among members is an efficient way to create value.  
  6 Modification of Organizational Practices and Policies With regard to converting to hybrid work, we conclude that an organization needs to modify some organizational practices and policies. These practices and policies correspond to how an organization manages its human capital. 6.1 Gamified Based HRM Practices Aligning with the increase in discussions on the metaverse as an alternative style of work office, the management of employees based on technology through the gamification approach will be appropriately fitting to implement in an organization. The gamification approach is an approach to human resources management based on games supported by the use of technology that exude relaxedness for employees and also increase their competence to innovate and capability to reach organizational goals.  
  Fig. 1. Essential things for using the metaverse as a future workplace.  
  7 Conclusion Our review offers insights into the essential needs for establishing the metaverse as a virtual workplace and provides some key strategies and conditions to be met. However, given the volatility of world work, we cannot guarantee that the pre-requisite conditions offered will remain the same for the next 5–10 years. The advance of virtual reality development may replace the leadership trait and style, the robot and machine may replace our whole work, ethical standards might be changed as well. However, we strongly recommend that spiritual values, especially those rooted in religious values, will take their place as basic fundamental values to catalyse any changes that occur within organization. Therefore, further research is needed to include how to select talent and prepare future leaders that are agile, adaptive, and empathetic to human needs in virtual environments.  
  Several studies have suggested that consumer satisfaction (CS) will increase repurchase intention (RI) [1–3]. However, a study conducted by [4] found the opposite result arguing that CS does not influence RI. Moreover, studies conducted by [3, 5] reported that consumer trust (CT) will increase RI. A study by [2], however, has yielded a contradictive result suggesting that CT does not affect RI. Therefore, research on the impact of CS on RI as well the impact of CT on RI has shown inconsistencies results. To fill the research gaps, this study proposes customer engagement (CE) to bridge the relationships between CS and RI as well as between CT and RI. This variable is proposed as a solution considering customer management strategies have evolved from transaction marketing to relationship marketing and are now evolving to CE [6]. Although the OFD service industry seems very promising, the nature of this market is still poorly understood. In any service industry, providing superior service is very important to increase CS and CT which lead to RI. This may be done through CE. Based on the above explanation, OFD service providers must fully understand the impacts of CS and CT on RI and how to increase the occurrence of RI through the role of CE in online services. Such understanding requires in-depth analysis of the nature of regression relationships between the studied constructs. For that reason, this study was conducted, to offer solutions on how to increase RI based on CS and CT and mediated by CE in the context of OFD service providers.  
  2 Theoretical Studies 2.1 Customer Engagement Engagement is defined as a state of being involved, directed, fully centered, or captivated of something (meaning constant attention), resulting in the consequences of a certain attraction or rejection. The more centralized an individual in approaching or moving away from a target, the more value is added or subtracted from the target [7]. [1] argue that CE is a mechanism for adding customer value to the company, either through direct or indirect contributions. Direct contributions may include customer purchases. Meanwhile, indirect contributions may consist of incentive references, conversations about brands on social media and feedback or suggestions provided by customers to the company. In the field of Business, engagement is discussed in the context of contractual relationships, while in Management, as an organization’s activity with its internal stakeholders. In the Marketing domain, engagement is associated with the level of active relationship between customers and the company and is referred to as customer engagement (CE) [6]. Understanding CE theory can improve our understanding on how CE differs from other customer relationship constructs. Engagement theory is developed from relationship marketing theory based on commitment and trust. CE is an interactive concept that arises during customer interaction with a company. CE reflects the customer’s descriptions and can be used to continuously develop company in more variative ways [7]. It is characterized by [8]: Enthusiasm, Attention, Absorption, Interaction and Identification.  
  shopping process and meet the needs of customers. Consumers will also assume that other consumers are reliable and care about their needs, thus promote positive perception of the Website. Consumers, therefore, consider e-commerce sites as a comfortable environment for shopping and feel satisfied with the sites. These full satisfaction and trust of consumers will give positive impacts on repurchase intention [11]. 2.5 Satisfaction and Trust Satisfaction, trust and commitment are the total quality of a relationship. The quality of relationship is defined as the overall customer evaluation on the strength of his/her relationship with the company. As mentioned earlier, satisfaction refers to a customer’s overall evaluation of his/her experiences with the company’s offerings. Trust is a necessary condition to build customer’s commitment to a company. Along with commitment, trust is placed at the heart of the relationship marketing framework. Trust in human relationships comes from mutual relationships. Satisfaction toward marketing relationships is considered the main prerequisite for long-term customer-company relationships, as well as a prerequisite for trust and commitment. Similarly, in CE models, CS is considered as a direct predictor of CT [12]. Buyer satisfaction occurs when products and services meet buyer expectations. This satisfaction will have an impact on consumer trust. In relation to OFD services, consumer satisfaction with OFD services in facilitating food purchases will have an impact on increased trust. Based on that statement, the second hypothesis is proposed as follows: H2. Increased satisfaction will result in an increase in trust. 2.6 Trust and Customer Engagement CE may be a relatively new concept compared to customer satisfaction or loyalty. More than twenty studies, however, have offered relevant perspectives regarding CE on social media [8, 13]. Consumers are using social commerce more frequently as a source of product-related information. They are participating in commercial activities supported by social media such as customer reviews, sharing, recommendations, and discussions. The definition of trust is selected, consistent with the perpective that trust is resulted by predictability. Following this definition, trust needs to be measured from a multidimensional perspective, including different guardians in social commerce. Trust is an important concept in e-commerce and can support significant positive outcomes, such as purchase intention, word of mouth, loyalty, and revisit intention [11]. Customer trust plays an important role in creating a strong bonding between service providers and customers. Trust leads to customers maintaining an ongoing committed relationship with the brand. Customers with a high level of trust tend to build solid relationships with the company. The theory of social exchange states that customers tend to interact with service providers they trust. CE can increase positive and reciprocal exchanges between customers and service providers, which strengthen their trust relationship. CE can increase CT. Highly engaged customers tend to keep their trust in the seller [14]. When consumers feel full trust in a product or service, the emotional bonding with the company becomes stronger [13].  
  A. Ratnawati and S. W. Ratnasari  
  Trust is a key success factor in interpersonal and business interactions. This statement is supported by a large number of research efforts in other disciplines such as Sociology, Social Psychology, Economics, and Marketing. Trust is critical in interactive exchanges among stakeholders as customers are anticipated to pay for services they have not received or experienced. CE can also be seen as a customer-to-enterprise relationship centered on the behavioral aspects of the relationship. Researchers also argue that CE includes customer co-creation in which customers may decide to use voice (communication behavior aimed at expressing their experience) or exit (behavior planned to limit or grow their relationship with the brand) [15]. CT and pleasure are closely related. By trusting the provider of services, satisfied consumers will intent to repurchase. Trust is also found to influence customer satisfaction, and that satisfaction positively influences the intention to repurchase [16]. Increased consumer trust will result in increased customer engagement [17]. In the context of OFD services, consumers who trust in OFD services will increase their engagement in the form of making purchases, providing referrals, providing feedback etc. Based on the above discussion, the third hypothesis is proposed as follows: H3: Increased trust will result in increased customer engagement 2.7 Repurchase Intention Re-purchase intention is the consumer’s desire to repurchase a certain product because it has benefits and quality based on previous purchases [18]. Repurchase intention is a consumer’s perception in related to satisfaction with the brand that may result in continuous information processing [19]. RI is manifested in the form of consumer’s willingness to continue buying or using the same products, to buy or use the products in the future, and consumer’s intention to buy or use the product again [20]. In line with this, [21] also suggests that RI is indicated by the consumer’s willingness to return, willingness to recommend, intention to return and the likelihood of repurchasing. 2.8 Satisfaction and Repurchase Intention Customers who have positive experiences with the company’s products and services will feel satisfied and are more willing to repurchase [1]. Satisfaction is an important and crucial construct in marketing. It is an essential factor to increase repurchase intention and build a long-term relationship between the company and the customer [22]. The study conducted by [20, 23] concluded that customer satisfaction will have an impact on repurchase intention. Regarding OFD services, customers who are satisfied with OFD will increase their repurchase intention. On the basis of this understanding, the fourth hypothesis is formulated as follows: H4. Increased satisfaction will result in an increase in repurchase intention  
  Customer Engagement in Online Food Delivery  
  2.9 Trust and Repurchase Intention Trust has an impact on consumer’s RI when measuring trust at the post-purchase stage. Post-purchase trust differs from initial trust. In the post-purchase phase, consumers have substantial and hands-on prior experiences to help making decision on whether to enter into future transactions with the same seller. In this repurchase situation, consumers tend to evaluate products or services based on their actual performances perceived after consumption. Using their hands-on experiences, customers tend to reevaluate their trust perception. When relationship-based trust has been built, consumers acknowledge past purchasing experiences and may hesitate to switch to a new online store because switching requires learning costs. When online sellers act in a way that build consumer trust, their consumers may perceive lesser risks when using their websites. Such circumstance may encourage their customers to make repeat purchases [24]. In e-commerce literature, trust is a key factor influencing customer’s purchase intention. Trust is a belief that the transaction partners will behave in a good will and in a favorable manner. Previous studies on trust in online shopping show that trust is positively related to repurchase intention [25]. In line with that study, it is understood that in OFD services, an increase in trust will result in an increase in repurchase intention. For this reason, the fifth hypothesis is proposed as follows: H5. Increased Trust will result in increased repurchase intention. 2.10 Customer Engagement and Repurchase Intention Customer engagement can be described as the process of developing cognitive, affective, and behavioral commitments to establish an active relationship with the company. Thus, CE can be manifested into four prominent dimensions: interaction, activity, behavior, and communication in a given context. The relationship also occurs in the management of e-commerce where engagement helps customers to make better online repurchase decisions [26]. CE behavior has been found to be a key driver of success in the online shopping environment and online brand community. A customer’s willingness to participate in the brand’s community can be seen in their willingness to repurchase merchandises or services from the brand. In the process of interaction, customers will establish close relationships with brand-related communities, and these relationships will encourage customers to purchase brand-related merchandises or services on a recurring basis [27]. Studies conducted by [8, 27, 28] have proven that increased customer engagement can result in increased repurchase intention. In accordance with those studies, hypothesis 6 is proposed as follows: H6. Increased customer engagement will result in an increase in repurchase intention.  
  5. Discourse Analysis In Gobenchmark, we have decided to implement the framework-based analysis because it generates descriptive and explanatory conclusions. The interviewee walks through 27 questions structured in domains and practices. Each practice can be answered by choosing Always, Often, Rarely, or Never. All the answers are stored in the SaaS-based Gobenchmark platform at the end of the analysis. 3.3 Scoring and Comparison In the early days of the stock market and securities, when no rating existed, people often lost their investments due to many unknowns in their purchased financial products. When rating agencies came in and rated, all financial products customers understood the risks [8] involved. As a result, they had much better chances to protect their investments by selecting products with a higher rating. The same principles apply to business applications. These days we have no rating for the reliability of business applications. A high CMM level is no indicator of performant, secure, and well-designed IT services. Nevertheless, the outcome of our qualitative analysis can be transformed to a rating from C- to A and indicates how organizations or teams are adopting industry best practices. By seeing the rating of practices and domains, we can identify blindspots, compare businesses to their peers, and set the foundation for generating a remediation plan. In Gobenchmark, we show the rating immediately after the qualitative analysis on a scoring dashboard. There are several benefits of seeing the score of practices and domains: • • • •  
  We understand gaps much faster. We can focus our efforts on critical blindspots. We have everything we need to show a comparison to industry standards, peers. We can build the remediation plan based on indentified gaps expressed by lower scores.

Thus, defining, explaining, and assessing knowledge quality, as well as researching in-depth and comprehensive knowledge that is contextually relevant and can be implemented to encourage people to achieve better moral awareness for themselves and others, is interesting to study. Future quality of knowledge must realize the benefits of knowledge for knowledge users and knowledge creators so that the level of quality assured. Moreover, current research also needs to pay more attention to the quality of obtaining and using knowledge. Great attention must be paid to how each individual or organization behaves while acquiring and using knowledge. One of the efforts that can be made to ensure that the process of obtaining and using knowledge will determine the quality of the knowledge itself is the individual’s involvement in seeking, obtaining, and using knowledge. According to Ho et al. [5, 6], cognitive engagement is concerned with an individual’s comprehension of the reasons why and methods for consistently producing their best work, as well as the impact this has on attaining organizational objectives. Absorption and attention are the two components of cognitive involvement, respectively. The cognitive absorption factor demonstrates the degree of employee involvement and ability to concentrate more on the duties of the position. Engagement level aims to raise the standard of work through innovation and creation (knowing how well their skills and function to support corporate objectives). Employees need a certain degree of cognitive resources to raise the quantity of work they do in order to be more productive. Affective engagement, on the other hand, is the sensation of being emotionally drawn to one’s job duties, coworkers, managers, leaders, and the work environment [7]. Workers who believe their work is valued, for instance, feel a sense of belonging, perceive their work as significant, and experience feelings of safety and confidence. Given that the firm fundamentally seeks stability, affective engagement may be more appropriate [6]. In this research, we integrate the importance of engagement in knowledge acquisition process and knowledge utilization process to ensure the knowledge quality. People who engage seriously in acquisition and implementation process both in term of cognitive and affective will have higher responsibility to assure that the knowledge is accurate, useful and only for good things, such as innovation and creativity. In conclusion, there is still much further study left. Therefore, this research will internalize engagement process to create and use knowledge in content, process, and results.  
  2 Literature Review 2.1 Knowledge Quality The most valuable asset in today’s information age is knowledge. Knowledge is a powerful intellectual asset because it is unique and distinctive. Furthermore, today’s competitive competition makes every company vie for a system to store and manage knowledge. Therefore, every organization’s performance can be judged by its intellectual assets. According to Nonaka and Takeuchi [8], there are two types of knowledge (intellectual assets): explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge. Explicit knowledge is the knowledge that has been collected and translated into a form of documentation (written) so that it is  
  Psychological Achievement Leadership: A New Leadership Style Based on Psychological Work Contract and Achievement Motivation Ratih Candra Ayu(B) , Olivia Fachrunnisa, and Ardian Adhiatma Department of Management, Faculty of Economics, Universitas Islam Sultan Agung (UNISSULA), Semarang, Indonesia [email protected]  , {olivia.fachrunnisa, ardian}@unissula.ac.id  
  Abstract. This paper aims to develop a new concept of leadership style based on psychological work contracts and achievement motivation. We used extensive and comprehensive literature to create a theoretical synthesis. The result shows that Psychological Achievement Leadership can be defined as leaders who can inspire and encourage members to always excel based on the psychological relational work contract that has been agreed upon. The ultimate goal to have the best work performance and achievement is psychological satisfaction by both leader and member. We also propose four dimensions to indicate psychological achievement leadership: Achievement Motivation, Inspirational Motivation, Affective Work Contract, and Cognitive Work Contract. In our future research, we empirically test the effectiveness of this concept to improve organizational performance.

  that will pave the way for changes to be made and implements the necessary plans for these changes to occur and takes the organization towards a better direction [3]. However, this transformation towards change only identifies mundane changes, not yet individual changes which in their psychological contract are caliphs who must lead their followers towards changes for the better. The leadership’s quick response to changes in the external environment is very important to prevent crimes that can arise at any time [4], but the orders of some leaders to subordinates have a low level of obedience which results in increased poor performance [5]. Leaders’ low awareness to always be proactive about environmental changes and proactively share knowledge with subordinates is the main factor for low performance [5]. In addition, the leadership’s adaptation to the new workplace environment and with the new team was not well established. A Leader is an officer who is ready to be placed anywhere, so adaptation learning is the key to success in leading however, the gap between rank and achievement of leaders and subordinates results in ineffective orders to be implemented [6]. A new leadership concept is needed which is a synthesis of the concepts of transformational leadership and the psychological contract, namely psychological achievement leadership so that organizations can quickly adapt to changes that occur then carry out generative learning to increase creativity and encourage organizations to adopt new ways to see old methods [4]. The application of psychological achievement leadership in the environment is expected to be the right step to carry out institutional changes, especially to improve the performance of leaders which is based on psychological rewards not on an economic orientation with organizational learning that is properly adapted from external changes.  
  2 Literature Review 2.1 Transformational Leadership: Intellectual Stimulation and Inspirational Motivation Intellectual stimulation dan inspirational motivation are the two dimensions of transformational leadership [6]. Transformational leadership is concerned with developing individual potential and fully motivating them towards the greater good versus their own self-interest, within a values-based framework [5, 6]. The transformational leadership model contains four components: idealistic influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individual consideration. Leaders who demonstrate inspirational motivation push their employees to achieve more than ever before by developing and articulating a shared vision and high expectations that motivate, inspire, and challenge [1]. Leaders who embody intellectual stimulation help employees to question their own commonly held assumptions, reframe problems, commit morals, and approach things in innovative ways. Several studies on motivation conclude that inspirational motivation is an important factor in the role of a leader in driving career success [6]. However, in the process individuals tend to see success from their personal orientation and ignore the importance of the ethical dimensions of motivation [7]. By incorporating an ethical dimension to achievement motivation will direct individuals to better management practices related  
  R. C. Ayu et al.  
  to performance achievement. Intrinsic motivation is the spirit to do the best and make continuous improvements coupled with always asking and helping team members to do their best. Ethical intrinsic motivation has several unique characteristics, including being divided into two dimensions of time, namely affective and cognitive aspects. Then, having the passion to be better does not stop when performance standards have been met but continues to strive for continuous improvement. To achieve the best performance, other people are not considered as competitors to be fought against but are considered as partners and objects to be used as benchmarks. Furthermore, someone who has motivation does not only think about himself but also invites and helps others in an effort to do good [8]. In connection with this inspirational motivation, leaders will provide motivating inspiration to followers, where one of them is the motivation to achieve great work performance. However, work performance that is often encouraged or inspired by leaders is work performance which may be related to economic motives in the form of monetary rewards or individual awards that refer to the economic dimension. This is in line with the work contracts established between leaders and followers. The psychological contract is a series of unwritten expectations between each member and the manager. The psychological contract is an employee’s individual belief that the organization has promised future returns and has an obligation to reward their contributions [9, 10]. The concept of ethical intrinsic motivation is the result of a synthesis of manifest needs theory and ethical values. This motivation has 4 (four) dimensions: voluntary helping and inviting others to socialize; voluntary helping and inviting others to help colleagues; voluntary helping and inviting others to join in; voluntary helping and inviting others to excel. Transformational leaders intellectually stimulate their followers to challenge existing assumptions and solicit followers’ suggestions and ideas. Finally, individual consideration occurs when leaders pay special attention to employees’ needs for achievement and development; they provide the empathy, compassion, support, and guidance needed for employee well-being [1]. Overall, this transformational leadership must be inspired by followers to achieve higher levels of performance [9]. Leaders who embody intellectual stimulation help employees to question their own commonly held assumptions, reframe problems, and approach things in innovative ways [9]. Transformational leaders intellectually stimulate their followers to challenge existing assumptions and solicit followers’ suggestions and ideas. Finally, individual consideration occurs when leaders pay special attention to employees’ needs for achievement and development; they provide the empathy, compassion, support, and guidance needed for employee well-being [11]. Overall, this transformational leadership must be inspired by followers to achieve higher levels of performance [3]. 2.2 Psychological Contract Psychological Contract is the process by which these perceptions come to an agreement between the two parties [10]. The literature on the type of contract shows that the importance of the type of contract will influence employee behavior. The importance employees attach to relational obligations has a positive effect on employee behavior. In human life there is an obligation to do good and avoid bad/bad actions which are universal and constitute a moral imperative, based on human nature. All forms of human  
  Psychological Achievement Leadership: A New Leadership Style  
  Abstract. Many efforts have been made in the Cultural Heritage field to build digital repositories based on standards for technological interoperability and for enriching the semantic content and the interconnection among the archived objects and with other repositories. The availability of standard APIs for linked information allows for the design and implementation of personalized recommendation systems, which are a relevant service for digital archives that aims at promoting the valorization of their content to visitors. In this paper, a prototype development of such a mechanism that is based on IIIF standards and IIIF-compliant open-source technologies is described.

  the construction of the semantic web must be accompanied by the need to preserve the expressiveness of the data, to avoid a dangerous semantic flattening. To address this issue ontologies are used. An ontology can be considered as a set of terms of knowledge, including vocabulary, semantic interconnections, and some rules of inference and logical rules for precise purposes. Enriching meta-data with ontology terms, or mapping linked data to ontology terms, allows for supporting advanced reasoning and for the development of smart applications. Semantic wrapping concerns the practice of incorporating metadata or semantic information within a database, such as a document, a file, or an object, to describe its content in a more accurate way. In the case of media contents, semantic wrapping is implemented annotating parts of the content, such as a specific area of an image or the frame of a video. In this paper, we present the design and the prototype implementation of techniques for automatic profiling and recommendation that exploits the combined utilization of semantic wrapping and ontologies to cultural heritage delivered by interoperable technologies.

  became one of the most popular vocabularies for use with RDF, more recently in the context of the Linked Data movement. Harmonise [2] enables seamless data exchange by following a semantic mapping approach. Instead of a fixed standard, Harmonise provides a reference model, the Harmonise ontology, which local data formats can be mapped against and in this way mapped to other local data formats or standards. In the sense of such a reference model, the Harmonise ontology defines all relevant concepts and relationships between concepts of the problem domain. A specific mapping mechanism and reconciliation engine then enable the translation of data from one local format to another and enable seamless data exchange and global interoperability. In order to solve the interoperability problem we have proposed an Ontology-mediated integration process based on a framework for data integration - instead of a new standard for the tourism domain. Increasingly these knowledge bases are being used in synergy with recommendation systems, in [5] a recommendation system is defined as a system that aims to generate meaningful recommendations for its users on articles that may be of interest to them. Recommendation systems, especially in the last period, are enjoying great success also in the field of cultural heritage and a large number of advancements are being made in this field. Another motivation behind recommendation systems is well described in [6] where it is noted that recommendation systems can be used to enhance those sites of interest that are often overlooked by tourists. Promoting lesserknown cultural sites is of fundamental importance for the preservation of a region’s cultural heritage.  
  3 Software Architecture The software architecture shown in Fig. 1 is composed of three main components. The annotation server that allow Content Providers for the semantic annotation by of IIIF contents using a domain ontology. Media contents are published in a digital archive IIIF compliant. Semantic annotations are indexed in a RDF triple-store for fast retrieval. The  
  A. Amato et al.  
  user profiler tracks the utilization of IIIF APIs by the client. In particular it records the list of viewed contents and, on each IIIF event, it eventually update a weighted list of ontology concepts which have been used to annotate the contents. The content recommendation system periodically uses the updated profile and the indexed annotations to compute a metric that evaluate the affinity with the available contents in the repository.  
  4 Semantic Annotation of IIIF Contents The International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) defines, among others, an API for the presentation of digital content through the web. The semantic wrapping is defined by standard elements of the standard presentation APIs and supported by compliant IIIF technologies. The semantic annotation of the IIIF manifest is supported by annotation servers and annotation tools, which respectively allow for the visual editing of the manifest and the retrieval of enriched metadata. In Fig. 2, it is shown how Simple Annotation Server allows for the creation of the semantic wrap of an area of the visualized image and its association to a free text or a tag. We extended the tool with the possibility to annotate the area with a concept of ontology. The button highlighted by the red circle opens a popup that allows for the selection and visualization of an imported ontology.

  Tangible assets are mainly documented through the use of metadata, i.e. information that describes the properties and characteristics of the asset in question. Tangible goods, as well as the documentation associated with them and with other types of goods, are collected in diﬀerent physical spaces and preserved by speciﬁc public or private bodies. The main places responsible for their conservation are libraries, archives and museums, the latter specializing in speciﬁc areas such as art, archaeology, natural history, science and so on. A small set of cultural assets is maintained and conserved by cultural associations and private citizens. The set of cultural assets conserved by an institution, body or private individual is called a collection. Archiving is essential for digital preservation that allows the conservation and access to the general heritage of humanity. This process is structured in a set of distinct activities which include scanning, inventory and the creation of special databases, accompanied by historical, artistic and aesthetic analysis of the property in question.

  In order to correctly deﬁne a conceptual model, it is necessary ﬁrst of all to analyze the peculiar characteristics of the contents associated with cultural heritage. The contents are multi format as they are present in various forms: text documents, images, audio and video recordings, etc. Moreover the contents are multi-topic because they can refer to diﬀerent topics: art, history, traditions, etc and multi-language. The contents are connected and interpreted diﬀerently based on the culture and traditions of a country, city or nation and can be aimed at diﬀerent types of people: experts and non-experts in the sector, young and old, etc. The contents are collected, maintained and published by various institutions and associations operating in the cultural sector, as well as by private citizens. A common problem deriving from these characteristics and the heterogeneity of the contents is the diﬃculty of making the information mutually interoperable [9]. In general, a set of contents is interoperable if the data present can be searched, semantically linked and presented to the user in an organic and standardized way, overcoming the constraints imposed by ad hoc implementations of the services of the various participating institutions. The interoperability of the conceptual model must be guaranteed both at the syntactic level, through the linking of diﬀerent data formats and diﬀerent collections, and at the semantic level, through the use of common metadata schemas and shared vocabularies for describing the information. The publication of cultural heritage data on the Web is not just a technological problem. A good part of the contents could be protected by licenses and/or copyrights. Moreover not all available information can be freely made public and published information may not be reliable [4]. Since it is diﬃcult to ignore or avoid these problems, the main objective becomes to maximize the amount of cultural content published

  for the description and management of complex electronic bibliographic objects. The scheme is divided into seven main sections: 1. METS Header: contains data useful for describing the METS document itself and some information such as the author, publisher... 2. Descriptive Metadata: may contain descriptive metadata external to the METS document (e.g. a MARC record in a catalog) and/or descriptive metadata integrated with the object. Repeatable. There are no speciﬁc guidelines for completing this section for which, as well as for the following section, one of the three metadata standards recommended by METS can be used: DC, MARCXML and MODS 3. Administrative Metadata: contains information regarding the creation and storage of ﬁles, intellectual property rights, the original object from which the digital object is derived and the provenance of the ﬁles 4. File Section: list of all content ﬁles that make up the digital object 5. Structural Map: explains the hierarchical structure of the digital object and the links between these elements, the ﬁles and metadata pertinent to each element 6. Structural Links: allows you to register any hyperlinks between nodes of the hierarchical structure 7. Behavior: it can be used to associate certain behaviors with the contents of the object Other standards are: – Dublin Core (DC) The strengths of the Dublin Core proﬁle are that it is concise and simple. In fact, the set is made up of only 15 elements, all optional and repeatable, which can be inserted in any order. The use of controlled vocabularies for the compilation of some ﬁelds (for example the Subject ﬁeld) is recommended, but it is not mandatory. The Dublin Core is somewhat at the opposite extreme compared to some hyper-speciﬁc and complete but equally complex metadata schemas, since it turns out to be quite simple, not very rigid, usable even by non-experts and suitable for many types of resources. This makes it a popular metadata schema and this ensures interoperability with numerous platforms. On the other hand, however, it has the disadvantage that there may be a need to integrate it with other metadata to respond to the needs of speciﬁc reference communities or to describe particular resources. The elements of the Dublin Core can be divided into three groups: Content related: Coverage, Description, Type, Relation, Source, Subject, Title; Related to intellectual property: Contributor, Creator, Publisher, Rights; Related to the instance: Date, Format, Identiﬁer, Language Precisely to try to overcome some limitations inherent in the scheme, a “richer” version of the Dublin Core was developed, deﬁned as qualiﬁed Dublin Core, which includes an additional element (Audience) and a series of qualiﬁers which further specify the meaning of the various elements (reﬁnement elements) or identify patterns that aid in the interpretation of the value of an  
  that may lack elements considered indispensable by experts in the ﬁeld. This paper describe several studies and a technological stack for the interoperability of metadata for archiving and for cataloging cultural heritage.

  Abstract. This paper proposes a methodology for the formal representation and the automatic evaluation of the organization model of the Italian Courts. This methodology is based on the implementation of BPMN models and their simulation by an open source technologies. In particular, the paper describes the application of the methodology to the activities of all phases of the Italian civil trial, focusing on a new Oﬃce denominated Oﬃce for the trial.

  provides a decision making support allowing for the evaluation in alternative scenarios, in which it is possible to conﬁgure the resources available in the Courts or to replace manual activities with ICT services [6]. The present study is part of a large project, involving researchers from University and personnel of the Italian Courts. The main goal of the project are the analysis and evaluation of the impact of the choices made by diﬀerent Courts about the organization of the UPP, taking into account the opportunities of advancing the level of computerization of existing activities. In this paper we present some examples of application of the proposed methodology to model and analyse the organizational choices made at the Italian Court of Santa Maria Capua Vetere to exploit a time-deﬁned support (Oﬃce of the process, UPP), in terms of human resources, granted by the Italian Ministry of Justice to improve the eﬃciency of the judicial process at national level.

  justice for the lawyers. The Central Manager can be accessed trough proprietary clients, or by employees of the Ministry of Justice, according to the speciﬁc role, by speciﬁc web dashboards. The SICID (“District Civil Litigation IT System”) manages the Registry of civil litigation voluntary jurisdiction and labor disputes. It is used in the Tribunals and Courts of Appeal by the Clerks of the Courts. Judges access to the System and to other services by a dedicated dashboard named the Judge’s Console. Computerized activities are represented in this speciﬁc BPMN model highlighting related processes and sub-processes and grouping them in a dedicated Software pool. For this BPMN scenario, activities are executed through speciﬁc tasks. In addition, to identiﬁes those activities that the various actors carry out with the support of telematic systems, this pool also includes the management and veriﬁcation of certiﬁed electronic communications. Each veriﬁcation activity is modeled as an exclusive gateway (XOR). Each activity is then concluded with an end event. With regard to the activities carried out by the Registry oﬃce, it should be noted that the main task of the Clerk of the Court is to assist the Judge in all activities that have to be documented through the drafting of a report. It follows that the activities carried out by the Judge through the “Judge’s Console” appear on the SICID as” to be worked on” and are then deﬁned after necessary intervention by the Registry oﬃce. Therefore, these activities are not represented in the Clerk of the Court pool, but in the pool of the Software. The interaction between the participants to the BPMN scenario are represented as message exchanges, which trigger new sub-processes. Exchanges of physical objects or of information between participants are represented through a dotted arrow. 3.3  
  Structural Check  
  The veriﬁcation of the BPMN model is an operation that checks the structure of the model against a list or rules processing the XML code in the BPMN2.0 standard format. The check is an automatic process performed by speciﬁc technologies such as the bpmnlint tool3 , which currently deﬁnes a set of 16 structural checks. Addressing the notiﬁed violations, such as the lack of the termination event or disconnected link it is not a diﬃcult task, but requires a suﬃcient level of technical knowledge about the BPMN theory. The deﬁnition of additional rules to be checked requires a multi-disciplinary skills, both technical and speciﬁc of the application domain. 3.4  
  Supervised Validation

  domain (the jurist) must checks that the sequence of operations and the document ﬂow respects the requirements. This operation is supported by visual tools that allow for the execution of the model, enabling the activation of several start events and the simulation of the consequent ﬂow through the animation of tokens that follow a speciﬁc path through the network. In Fig. 3 the BPMN details models the activities carried out by the UPP employee supporting the Registry oﬃce of the single Judge. In Fig. 3 diﬀerent coloured token are ﬂowing trough the model. The start event into the Registry oﬃce pool represents the delegation of the activities by the Clerk of the Court to the UPP employee starts from. The activities delegated are the examination of the workload, the scanning of paper ﬁles with transmission of the scanned contents to the District Civil Litigation IT System and the monitoring of the backlog. The XOR gateway used in split mode allows models the exclusive choice than diﬀerent token can follow only one ongoing branch. The following OR gateway allows the rejoin of the alternative ﬂows generated by previous gateways in the process. The process ends with a message-type end-event, which describes the communication of the completed activity by the delegated UPP employee to the delegating Registry oﬃce. The end event is combined with a signal which is followed by the conclusion of the process. As it is shown by the controls shown in Fig. 3 the operator can pause and restart the execution and he can control not only the generation of events. In fact, he can also change interactively the routing of the tokens along alternative paths acting on each gateway. The list of the events for the diﬀerent tokens is dynamically updated and can be used as a trace of the completed execution.  
  Quantitative Analysis  
  The execution of the model described in the previous section does not support batch simulations and the quantitative evaluation of model performance. The model, possibly reduced, is then simulated complementing its structure with the some additional information. Resources represent any kinds of human, software or physical infrastructure which are required to perform the activities composing the model. Each resource type is characterized by its cost, its availability and cardinality. In Fig. 4 resources are depicted as red and blue human icons and their availability as time-tables. For each activity duration and resource mapping must be deﬁned. These parameters will keep busy the assigned resource type and will cause the pause of the workﬂow in the case of resource unavailability. As it is shown in Fig. 4, duration of an activities can be deﬁned in terms of statistical distribution. The simulation workload is characterized in terms of statistical distribution of the arrival rate of start events, total number of events and eventually time horizon of the simulation. Finally, the probability of activation of the alternative routes must be deﬁned for each gateway. Example of probability values are reported in Fig. 4. Simulation results are generated both in terms of process duration and usage (and cost) of the assigned resources until the completion of input load, and within the time horizon. To this aim, Scylla4 , an open source simulator has been used. Scylla is an extensible BPMN process simulator which relies on the building blocks of discrete event simulation. The process simulator oﬀers an UI where BPMN models can be extended with the simulation-speciﬁc information deﬁned before. Scylla is implemented in the Java programming language. It oﬀers well-deﬁned entry points for extensions based on a plug-in structure. Simulation-speciﬁc information are grouped in three ﬁles. 4

  Abstract. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the various formal models that can be used to represent a story. The analysis focuses on two types of representation families: semantics-based representations, which use ontologies, and process-based representations. The aim is to provide a comparative overview of the models, analyzing their weaknesses and strengths, in order to determine the formal model that best lends itself to modeling a story by highlighting its main components in terms of the actors involved, events, actions, spatio-temporal relations, as well as cause and effect, in hopes of identifying the formal story representation model that can be used as the starting point for developing a framework that can perform automated storytelling generation. Finally, examples are given of the uses of these models to represent a mythological story.

  described in Sect. 2.2; Sect. 2.3 provides a detailed comparison of the models described before; Sect. 3 reports the final model proposed for the representation of a story and a practical example of the application of the proposed model; Sect. 4 closes the paper with final remarks and addresses future research directions.  
  2 Storytelling Models: State of the Art Several models have been proposed in the literature for the representation of a story. Work [8], for example, describes the use of a StoryFlow Model for modeling a story, using “storylines” to describe the evolution of the plot of each actor within the story. Another interesting model for representing a story is the Story Graph, described in paper [14], which allows a story to be modeled as a graph whose nodes can represent the events and/or main concepts of a story, while the arcs represent the causal relationships between events or the semantic relationships between concepts. A more in-depth analysis of the main semantic and process-based models for modeling a story follows in Subsects. 2.1 and 2.2. 2.1  
  Semantic-Based Models for Story Representation  
  • Act and Scene: defines the acts into which a story is composed. A story is divided into several acts, and each act can be divided into several scenes. An act is a recursive structure in that one of its nuclei or satellites can contain another act. This recursive structure is of considerable benefit when we want to semantically describe stories that recall other stories within them. • Nucleus and Satellite: in Rhetorical Structure Theory, a nucleus represent a central part of the story whose removal would result in the loss of information relevant to the correct continuation of the storyline. Satellites, on the other hand, represent secondary parts of the story that clarify or add information about a nucleus. • Event: defines the events of a story. Each Nucleus is associated with a single event via the “hasSpan” relation. • Concept: defines a specific topic that a story or part of it may refer to. • Agent: defines the actors who participate in a Scene by performing or being part of one or more Events. • Role: defines the parts that the agents play during a Scene. • Relation: A Relation is a rhetorical binding between two entities, which refers to a specific rhetorical function. As specified in RST [10], entities in a Relation can be both Nucleuses (which is defined as a Multinuclear Relation Type) or a Nucleus - Satellite pair (which is defined as a Nucleus-Satellite Relation Type). It is also possible to use the concept of “Relation” to associate an actor and the role he plays in a specific scene. The second ontology proposed in this comparison is the ONAMA Ontology described in work [7], which enables the description of the essential features of literary narratives, particularly medieval ones. ONAMA provides an OWL1 model for a cross-media description of actions, actors, settings, and temporal structures, providing the possibility of linking these elements to narratives using layered semantic roles. Figure 2 shows the structure of ONAMA Ontology.  
  Fig. 2. ONAMA Ontology 1  
  L. Colucci Cante et al.  
  Some of the main classes present in Fig. 2 are described below: • Actor: describes the protagonists of a narrative. Actors can be people, animals, groups of individuals, or even mythological beings. • Semantic Role: describes the semantic role of an entity associated with the narrative. ONAMA distinguishes different roles: i) “Causer Role” to denote the role of an entity that is the author or instigator of an event; ii) “Participator Role” to denote the role of animated entities that participate in an event but have no control over it; iii) “Benefactor Role” to denote the role of entities that are advantaged or disadvantaged by an event. • Place: defines the location where a narrative can take place; • Time Span: defines the temporal extension in which a narrative may take place. The third ontology proposed in this comparison is the Common Narrative Model Ontology (CNMO) described in work [2], which attempts to provide a narrative representation model for the development of a shared knowledge base that can be populated in the future with the outcomes of new storytelling systems without the need to modify it for each unique representation model-specific system. Figure 3 shows the structure of RST Ontology. The model has been designed in a hierarchical structure, in which the root concept is the “Story”. It is composed of two classic narratological components: the plot and the space. The “Plot” is represented as a sequence of scenes, while a “Scene” represents a single episode inside the plot, which consists of a sequence of events. An “event”, on the other hand, may consist of one or more actions or happenings; unlike “Actions”, which represent voluntary acts performed by one or more characters in the story, a “happening” represents involuntary acts that occur as a consequence of a previous action or event. Also related to the scene is the concept of “Time”, which identifies the time span within which the scene is set. Space, which includes the entire universe in which the story takes place, is the other narrative element that is visible from this ontology. The most significant components of space are explained below: • Location: can be considered the scenario in which every scene that composes the plot takes place. • Setting: is a combination of a set of physical - or virtual - locations in which the action of the story takes place, and the set of cultural and physical rules that govern the story world. • Existent: represents the whole set of actors that take part in the story. They can be persons, animals, or objects. • Function: defines the functional role of a character in the plot. • Cognition: defines the psychological - cognitive sphere of a character in the story, which can be expressed through a BDI (Belief - Desire - Intention) model [4, 6].  
  A Comparative Analysis of Formal Storytelling Representation Models

  2.2 Process-Based Models for Story Representation Several process-based models have been investigated, but one of the most interesting is the BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation), which is one of the most successful standards for modeling business processes in the literature. Some works, such as [13] and [1], propose the idea of using the BPMN’s graphical notation to describe a story. The standard provides several useful features for story modeling, the most important of which are listed below: • Actions and Events Representation: the constituent elements of a scene can be represented through BPMN Activities and BPMN Events. • Actors: it is possible to specify who the actor performing an activity by placing them in “pools” and “lanes”. • Flows: using “sequenceFlows”, the BPMN allows the causal sequence between actions and events within a scene, or between different scenes, to be represented very well. By using “Parallel Gateways”, it is possible to indicate that the plot splits into several flows executed in parallel, while with “Exclusive Gateways”, it is possible to indicate that a flow of the plot will only be executed if an appropriate condition is satisfied. • Time: the BPMN standard does not offer an explicit way of representing the time in which a scene or event takes place. However, it is possible to use a “Timer Start Event” or a “Timer Intermediate Catch Event” to indicate the time between two activities/events, or the time in which an event is to occur. • Recursive Scene Modelling: it sometimes happens that an action or event in the story leads to the recursive initiation of a new scene or act. The BPMN offers the construct “SubProcess” [12] for the definition of subprocesses that can call up a new scene, a new act, or even a new story. Figure 4 shows a fictitious example of modeling a story using BPMN notation.  
  simulate the actors in a story, ONAMA defines a set of fascinating roles as well as some helpful concepts (groups, animals, mythological beings, etc.). The BPMN offers an interesting way to represent a story due to the comprehensive graphical notation of its elements; it excels at modeling the actors and flow of a story and also supports modeling recursive stories by defining “Sub-Processes”, but it has limitations when it comes to modeling the setting of a scene as well as the roles of the actors. By semantically annotating the BPMN’s structural parts with concepts from domain ontologies, as defined in [3, 5], these limitations can be solved. The expressiveness of BPMN’s graphical notation might be combined with all the benefits each of the semantic models has to provide if one or more of ONAMA, RST, or CNM were adopted as the domain ontology properly.  
  3 Proposed Framework for Story Representation and Illustrative Example As a result of the analyses discussed in Sect. 2.3, we concluded on a final framework that we presume is the most appropriate for formally and comprehensively representing a story for storytelling. The final framework is just an ontology that combines the RST, ONAMA, and CNM ontologies. One example of how the framework may be applied is to semantically represent the mythological story “Teseo and the Minotaur” [9]. Figure 5 demonstrates the story’s modeling.  
  Fig. 5. Representation of Story “Teseo and the Minotaur” with the framework proposed  
  Fig. 6. Semantic Description of the Scene “Background”  
  The first scene of the story consists of 3 events: i) the Construction of the Labyrinth; ii) the Death of Androgeo, brother of King Minosse; iii) the Decree of the King for the selection of seven boys and seven girls each year. This scene has “Creta” as its Location and “Minosse”, “Androgeo”, “Minotaur” and “Teseo” as its actors. Furthermore, each event is linked to its constituent actions. For example, the event “Construction of the Labyrinth” consists of two temporally consecutive actions: i) Request for the Construction of the Labyrinth; ii) Imprisonment of the Minotaur in the Labyrinth. This structured organization of the story was achieved solely through the application of CNM ontology concepts. The story is represented as a graph, with nodes representing the actions, events, scenes, and plots of the story and edges representing the logical ordering of the story’s pieces. Each node in the graph is a “piece” of the story, whose combination yields the plot. Figure 6 shows a comprehensive view of the “Scene Background” node; the text related to the scene is associated with it through the data property “hasText”. It is possible to relate a scene, event, or action to media contents inherent to the portion of the narrative by defining appropriate properties. The ONAMA ontology serves to specify the roles of actors in the story: the Minotaur, for example, is an instance of the “Mythological Being” class of ONAMA. RST ontology, on the other hand, is extremely useful in defining the roles that each actor in the story may play in each scene. Figure 7 shows the roles that the actor “Teseo” has in the first two scenes. Even during narration, an actor can play a variety of roles. Teseo, for example, interprets the role of “sacrificial victim” in the Background scene (Fig. 7a), in which he is one of the seven children selected to access the labyrinth and fight the minotaur, and he interprets the role of “hero” in the later scene (Fig. 7b).

  Abstract. Juridical systems are inherently complex, since they address numerous and critical processes that are regulated by several laws and regulations. Furthermore, such regulations change with more or less frequency, thus provoking the evolution of the entire Juridical system. In order to adequately regulate a sophisticated system, it is imperative to establish and utilize models as well as to monitor the system’s progression. In this paper, historical logs of Trials are used to build model that can be used to keep track of the regulation changes, and their effect on the Juridical system, through the years. In particular, the formalism provided by Finite State Machines will be used to represent the information extracted from the logs, and to provide a homogeneous model.  
  D. Branco et al.  
  regarding characteristics and properties of the Italian Telematic Civil Process. In particular, such studies enabled the identification of time consuming events [6] and made it possible to build multi-agent simulation tools to understand the impact of organisational changes in Courts [4]. However, a model to detect and monitor juridical changes and their effect on the system that enables the whole Telematic Process has not been defined yet. For this reason, methodology and tools to reconstruct the processes underlying the current Juridical System from execution logs are needed. Process Mining techniques can be exploited to analyse the historical logs, and to determine the best FSM model to represent the underlying system [1]. However, such techniques need to take also in consideration the evolution and changes that have influenced the Juridical System. In particular, we are interested in observing the evolution of the model through the years, through the comparison of several FSMs extracted from the historical logs referring to different operating years. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: Sect. 2 describes the generic models that can be applied to this case study, that is Finite State Automata; Sect. 3 provides a first reconstruction of the model, through the analysis of historical logs from the Court of Livorno; Sect. 4 provides a high granularity view on the evolution of the FSMs over the years, using a graphical depiction of the extracted models; Sect. 5 refines the evolutionary view on the system, considering the changes happening to the model during different years; Sect. 6 closes the paper with final remarks and future directions.  
  2 Use of Finite State Automata to Model the Juridical System A Finite State Automaton (FSA) or Finite State Machine (FSM) [5] [7], is defined as an Event State Machine, i.e. a mathematical model used to describe the behavior of a system, in a clear and simple way. A Finite State Machine is made up of a set of States, which define the situation in which the system finds itself in a certain instant, and a set of Inputs, which represent what causes, or may cause, the change of State, i.e. the evolution of the system. The Inputs can be of various types: in the case of an Event States Machine, an Input corresponds to a particular Event that has occurred in the system. Each triple Current State-Input-Next State is called a Transition. A Finite State Machine has three main characteristics: • The ability to evolve over time, changing one’s State. • The possibility to represent States and Inputs of the system in a discrete way. • The property of being able to enumerate in a Finite way States and Inputs of the system. There are two specific types of Finite State Automata. Deterministic Automata are such that each Input to the Automaton determines, based on the current State, one and only one subsequent State. Non-deterministic Automata, on the other hand, can have, even with the same Input, multiple destination States for each current State. Both types of Automa have a finite number of possible Initial States, and a finite number of Admitted Final States. Furthermore, no State must be “isolated”, i.e. there  
  Towards the Reconstruction of the Evolutionary Behaviour  
  Each historical log file, describing a single Trial, has been pseudonimized first, and then provided in .csv format, with each row of the files containing the following relevant information: the object code to which the process refers, the process identification number, the current state identifier, the next state identifier, the event identifier that produced the transition, and a date indicating the exact moment the event was triggered. With this information, it was possible to reconstruct a Finite State Machine that all the Trials, during the reference year, followed. An example of a reconstructed Finite State Machine is provided in Fig. 1. Given the large number of self-edges affecting the various nodes of the machine itself, the self-edges themselves have been collapsed into a single self-edge. From this initial analysis, it was noted that different self-edges with the same identifier occur on several different nodes. After a discussion with domain experts it became clear that different events, such as the ones referring to document annotations or access to records, can be triggered in different States and at any time in the Trial regardless of the state in which the Trial itself is, without altering the workflow of the machine. For this reason, these events were identified and cut from subsequent analysis. In order to identify recurrent self-edges spread over all nodes, the event-state machine-generated from all historical logs was reconstructed regardless of the year in which the processes were initiated. The resulting Graph is provided in Fig. 2. The machine’s complexity primarily stems from its events, as demonstrated in this Figure. Therefore, it is necessary to identify and eliminate events that can be triggered  
  Towards the Reconstruction of the Evolutionary Behaviour  
  regardless of the machine’s current state. To this end, an analysis of the percentage of occurrence, with respect to states, of the self-edges of the Finite state Machine was carried out from the total reconstructed machine. The analysis yielded the results presented in Fig. 3. From the figure, we can see how a good number of self-edges are reported on more than eighty percent of the machine. This behavior, therefore, suggests that we should eliminate from future analyses all events that have as their identifier one of those that, in the total reconstructed Finite State Machine, has an occurrence rate greater than eighty percent. This choice turns out to be necessary because, the goal of the work is to identify substantial years of change in the Finite State Machine and that they may reflect the regulatory and legislative change, having self-edges spread over multiple states does not benefit the calculation, identification, and treatment so it was decided simply to ignore them is that they did not contribute any information content with respect to the goal of the work.  
  4 FSM Models Comparison The analysis continued by examining the evolution of the Finite State Machine over time, year by year, comparing the percentage of change from the previous year, after removing recurring self-edges in the graph. An initial analysis was made by comparing graphs generated from two consecutive log years, essentially identifying three main subgraphs:  
  6 Conclusion and Future Works This paper emphasizes the significance of having an uncomplicated model to comprehend the actions of Civil Trials and its alterations over the years. To achieve this, a Finite State Machine approach was employed to portray the workflow of the Trials. Actual historical log data, obtained from the Court of Livorno, were used to create the FSA model, which was tailored to distinct years. Comparisons of the output data revealed variations in the States and Events, providing insight into the changes over time. By analysing such results, it is not only evident that changes happen from year to year, but it is also possible to determine such changes with a fine granularity, and to provide material for more informed analysis of the model, which can be carried out with the assistance of domain experts, that can help in recognising the norms and regulation that have brought to the Machine alteration. In Future Works, the objective will be to focus on the identification of variable States and Events, and on their connection to such legislative changes, in order to.

  Reinforcement Learning-Based Root Planner for Electric Vehicle Pietro Fusco(B) , Dario Branco, and Salvatore Venticinque University of Campania “Luigi Vanvitelli”, Aversa, Italy {pietro.fusco,dario.branco,salvatore.venticinque}@unicampania.it  
  Abstract. Electric Vehicles (EVs) have been identiﬁed as the current innovation for sustainable mobility that reduces carbon emissions and pollution. The transition to electric mobility is accelerating, and this means that services and infrastructures must be ready to support the impact of such a change. Smart applications can leverage this transition contributing to a seamless integration of the expected increase of new energy loads into the electric grid assisting users’ behaviour. At the same time, they must comply with the strict regulations in terms of privacy and deal with limited users’ acceptance. In this context, we propose a Policy-Based Reinforcement Learning agent-based route planner that is able to suggest a route to a driver who starts from a location A traveling to a location B minimizing the number of re-charge sessions along the journey.

  In the Sect. 4.1, a PG method REINFORCE method was introduced. major  
   One  issue with the PG REINFORCE method is that the gradient, ∇θ J θ , shows high variance in each update. Basically, high variance is due to the major diﬀerence in the episodic returns. Generally, the PG algorithm is an on-policy method, namely the policy with which episodes are generated is the same policy whose vector parameters θ are updated in every iteration using Eq. (13). Since the policy is getting improved on every iteration, the return can vary greatly in each episode [14] and it introduces a high variance in the gradient updates. When the gradients have high variance, then it will take a lot of time to attain convergence. To reduce variance, a new function called baseline function is introduced. Subtracting the baseline b from the return (reward-to-go) Rt reduces the variance, so the gradient can be rewritten as follows: N K−1  
     
  k=0  
  T −1 where Rt is the return reward-to-go Rt = t=k rt , which is the return of the trajectory starting from the state st . In this paper one of the most popular functions of the baseline will be used, that is the Value function which represents the value of a state, in other words, it is the expected return an agent would obtain starting from that state following the policy π.

  Conclusion  
  This paper proposed a RL technique applied to the EVPR. Using a stochastic Policy-Based method we demonstrated how it is possible to train the model for ﬁnding the most eﬃcient route that is characterized by minimal re-charge sessions and the shortest distance. Even if experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed approach, other algorithms must be compared using real data and the same problem must be solved in a multi-user scenario, where multiple EVs must collaborate, among them and with charge stations, to compute the best itinerary and charge plan.  
  Abstract. As network traffic increases, congestion and delays that can degrade network service quality and cause network downtime to become a problem. QoS control is one way to solve this problem. Network engineers need to learn about the mechanism of QoS control and use it effectively. However, QoS control is difficult to understand intuitively because it operates inside network devices. Therefore, visualization of QoS control behavior is considered effective for verifying its operation and for efficient learning. In this paper, we implemented a system that visualizes the QoS control process inside a router using animation for learning.

  Abstract. In recent years, the demand for EC has increased in the apparel industry due to the coronavirus pandemic. Previous researches have focused on trends in the fashion industry and researched consumer purchasing consciousness in the coronavirus pandemic. In response to the current situation of becoming post coronavirus pandemic, we conducted an ongoing research of consumer purchasing consciousness, and compared and study the trends. This discussion refers to sales trends in the apparel industry during the coronavirus pandemic. And the websites at EC are increasingly using digital services that utilize the latest technologies such as AI, VR, augmented reality, and Metaverse. Previous researches have also shown that the use of VR through smartphone applications is effective. One of the most obvious changes is virtual fashion service by smartphone, but at the same time, the hassle of trying on clothes in store is becoming apparent. Based on the status of those domestic and overseas digital services that utilize fashion tech, we tried to develop a smartphone application. By extension, we will consider whether the increased attention world of Metaverse will have an impact on the fashion industry. Digital Transformation in the apparel industry at reality would increase efficiency in design, production, distribution, sales, and inventory control. Therefore, from the perspective of Environmental, Social and Governance investment in light of the Sustainable Development Goals, we will study the information society of the future fashion tech.  
  Looking at the results of comparing items such as what services and apps are good to have, the most common in 2022 was the service with wearing images it for each height and body type. Recently, the demand for pictures of people wearing clothes is increasing, and more and more people are looking at pictures of clothes they are interested in wearing and coordination on Instagram and TikTok. In addition, services using VR have been introduced at real stores. While there is a reputation for not having to worry about trying on clothes at real stores, it was pointed out that it was embarrassing for others to see how they moved in front of the digital signage. Due to these facts, it can be said that virtual fashion has produced a certain effect as a solution to the problem of fitting and size (Fig. 6).  
  Try-on service  
  3.2 Demand for Fashion Services Using VR, AR, and Metaverse With the development of VR and rapid onlineization, many companies have begun to use VR for promotion and entertainment. VR, which is not restricted by time or place and can deliver experiences just by looking at it, is mainly chosen as an advertising method in the fashion industry. For example, by holding a fashion show in VR or holding a virtual exhibition, you can approach a wide range of people. Well-financed apparel companies are developing their own VR and AR services. Similar to these technologies, Metaverse is attracting attention in the apparel industry. There is an image that it is nothing more than a mere item for avatars. However, there is a movement to acquire customers who do not usually visit the brand’s real stores for another purpose. Just as the apparel industry’s marketing channel has shifted to SNS, we anticipate that it will grow into one of the leading customer channels in the future. As environmental awareness of sustainability increases, the apparel industry is being forced to review its supply chain. Among them, Metaverse is attracting attention as a means of solving these problems. For instance, BEAMS, an apparel company, sells real products on Metaverse and induces customers to real stores. Overseas, RTFKT, a company under Nike, is developing a service that allows avatars to wear sneakers and clothes in Metaverse and use AR to experience as if they were actually wearing sneakers. It has potential as a service that increases sales at real stores and creates new value. 3.3 Smartphone Application Development Experiments The development language adopts Unity, which is good at developing graphical applications that are good at 2D/3D games. And it adopts AR Foundation, an official Unity package for developing AR applications common to all platforms, as a method for realizing XR. Conventional AR application development often uses AR libraries prepared for each platform, and it was necessary to develop the same application for each platform. AR Foundation provides platform-independent AR libraries, so you can easily develop AR applications that are common to all platforms. As for non-smartphone apps, there are web apps, which can be considered in the same way as normal web development. However, since it is an application that runs through a browser, it is necessary to think about how to store information that does not allow the camera to perform to its full potential (Table 3). For XR. Use the terminal position as the origin and position the clothes object at eye level with the center displayed 1.2 m above ground. Use Face Tracking to place the

  In general, 3D data is comprised of two elements, with one file containing information about the object’s shape, including lines and vertices, and the other file containing data about the object’s appearance, such as color and texture. However, creating large amounts of clothing data efficiently is a challenge for real stores, which may have thousands to tens of thousands of items. Although a 3D scanner can be used to obtain exhaustive 3D data, it is difficult to do so in practice. Presently, smartphone apps use AI-generated images based on clothing images provided by companies to allow users to try on clothes virtually. Additionally, designers utilize 3D CAD during the design phase.  
  A Study on Changing Consciousness of Post Coronavirus Pandemic  
  M. Sakaguchi et al.  
  4 Conclusion In the survey of changes in purchasing consciousness this time, we can see that there is a clear shift to the Internet society due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and consideration for the environment. The utilization of digital technology is inevitable for the efficiency of the Internet society. One of the keywords is virtual fashion, so we actually developed an app. It was surprisingly easy to create a demo version mockup in a few days, but it turned out that there were many challenges in providing it as a business. From this point of view, the question arises whether it is not always necessary to use technology to solve various problems. It is an analog concept that emphasizes real stores, but as a result, depending on the function of the app, we felt that the possibility of trying on clothes expanded. Many existing virtual fashion fitting services utilize avatars. In addition, the wearing image posted does not show the fabric texture and shrinkage rate of the clothes. This is as much of an annoyance as the size issue, as evidenced by surveys. In other words, the fashion service demanded by users is to understand the size, fabric texture, and shrinkage rate of clothes, and to create an image. Since application development evolves along with technological progress, epoch-making services will be provided sooner or later. On the other hand, in this research study, we considered the possibility of a new business model. With the fusion of Metaverse + EC + real stores, it is a mechanism in which the clothes that you customize or design are immediately commercialized and delivered to your hands. It is the realization of a sustainable world where the apparel industry contributes to society on a global scale in response to the issues of attachment to clothes, product life, and clothing loss.  
  5 Future Work In the apparel industry, various changes are occurring due to technological innovation and trends after the coronavirus pandemic. With the advent of “online customer service,” which allows customers to request styling over the Internet, and “live commerce,” which allows customers to purchase products distributed in real time, EC market is expected to expand significantly in the future. Consumers are also spending more time in virtual communities due to technological advances. On the other hand, there is an attempt to strengthen the sales staff who coordinate at real stores. In any case, the formation of a fashion community is an important measure for apparel companies, along with capital investment in IT. The omni-channel, which considers real stores and EC as a consistent channel, will be promoted. We also anticipate that consumer environmental awareness will increase the need for long-lasting, reusable and recyclable products. Companies and brands that make clothing with sustainability in mind are one of the deciding factors in purchasing. We will continue to conduct research and surveys on what role fashion tech will play in the changing times and technological trends, taking into account the SDGs.  
  Abstract. This paper proposes a new 3D visualization tool based on Cubic Gantt Charts. This new tool has co-browsing functionality that allows multiple users to simultaneously see the visualization results of Cubic Gantt Charts and supports VR goggles. Therefore, it makes possible collaborative immersive visual data analytics. In addition, this new visualization tool has a recording function that stores users’ visualization activities such as translation, rotation and zooming, and replay function that shows past activities to current users later. These recording and replaying functions are significant for multiple users to analyze data collaboratively. This paper introduces these functions and explains how they work for collaborative immersive visual data analytics. Keywords: VR · Web-based Visualization tool · Co-Browsing · Interaction log  
  new 3D visualization tool based on Cubic Gantt Charts proposed in this paper, developed by JavaScript, is a web-based VR visualization tool that has co-browsing functionality. This tool is more accessible than traditional systems, as it can be used with any browser and without any specific software. The VR world has much more flexibility compared to normal 2D screens. It allows users to watch and manipulate the visualization tool freely, unlike traditional screens which inhibit flexibility of certain actions. If users find data points of interest while manipulating the charts, they may want to discuss them with others. Our previous Cubic Gantt Chart visualization tool was incapable of doing so. Contrarily, our new co-browsing Cubic Gantt Chart visualization tool has a function that records past users’ visualization process and replays them to current users later. In addition, our co-browsing Cubic Gantt Chart visualization tool supports VR goggles. Therefore, it enables collaborative immersive visual data analytics. This paper is organized as follows: there are related works in Sect. 2. We introduce our previous visualization tool based on Cubic Gantt Charts and explain how users can analyze the data with them in Sect. 3. Next, in Sect. 4, we introduce our new co-browsing Cubic Gantt Chart visualization tool that allows multiple users to watch the charts at the same time. We also explain the functions of recording past users’ activities in the visualization processes and replaying them to current users. In Sect. 5, we discuss the benefits of the proposed visualization tool in data analytics. Finally, we conclude the paper and discuss potential avenues for future work.  
  5 Discussion 5.1 Web-Based Visualization Tool Barrett et al. proposed supporting cross platform collaboration as one of the grand challenges in collaborative analytics [4]. As a response to this challenge, we developed this VR visualization tool with JavaScript to enhance accessibility beyond previous visualization systems. Using JavaScript as the basis for this tool allows users to access it with smartphones, even though sections above explained how to watch this visualization tool with and described communication between VR headsets and the server in the previous section. An optional 2D display is available if users would not like to watch it in VR due to motion sickness, personal preference, or other reasons. We have not studied the difference between and impact of 2D version and VR versions. We suggest studies into these differences as one of our future works (Fig. 7).  
  Fig. 7. An example of the view of the screen in VR mode on an android smartphone (left) and an example of the view of the screen with VR headset (right).  
  Fig. 8. One example of the emphasis effect and how it helps focus attention on precise areas being viewed  
  5.3 Usefulness of Recording Logs and Replaying Their Previous Actions While using the visualization tool individually, users have different opinions from their own visual perspective. They cannot reproduce the previous view when they come up with their opinions after they enabled co-browsing function because the VR world is much more flexible when compared to 2D screens. Saving logs and replaying previous actions helps users quickly and accurately replicate actions taken on the tool, such as moving back and forth between viewing angles. This also enables users to share what they look at and how to manipulate if they enable the co-browsing function. We will extend this function not only logging the interactions but also saving points of interest like the ReVise toolkit [14]. Another helpful feature may be to write down a memo in VR space, like we do on paper in the real world. We believe users could share notes easily in VR space with this system architecture. There is also the potential to study the interaction logs [19]. Data from these logs could identify areas where users tend to look, which may be useful to analyze.  
  6 Conclusion In this paper, we proposed new features allowing multiple users to watch Cubic Gantt Charts in VR space simultaneously. This function enables multiple users to analyze data and discuss its characteristics. This paper also introduced functions to record users’ activity data and to replay the past data to current users. These two features are useful for users to share their experience with other users, and the use of VR is more accessible and convenient than our previous visualization tool. The proposed web-based VR system could work on any web-browser platform without any specific software.

  Abstract. In this paper, the authors treat a native interface of IntelligentBox for two hands’ gesture input. IntelligentBox is a 3D graphics software development system that provides 3D primitive components. Users can develop 3D applications as composite components composed from such 3D primitive components through direct manipulations of a mouse device on a computer screen. In the situation like COVID-19 pandemic, contactless input interfaces are significant. The authors have already proposed one dedicated component of IntelligentBox works as the input interface of two hands’ gesture for its 3D applications. In this paper, the authors propose a new native interface for two hands’ gesture input of IntelligentBox that allows users to create 3D applications without using any contact device like a mouse device.

  3.2.2 Tests for Mouse Cursor Operations In operating the mouse cursor using the input of Leap Motion Controller, we tested which finger information corresponds to which operation. First test is for the mouse cursor moving. Possible finger data for operating the mouse cursor include the position of the palm and the position of the tip of the index finger. If the position of the tip of the index finger is used for the position of the cursor, there is a possibility that problems such as hindering the subsequent left-click and right-click operations, or causing the cursor to blur due to the click action may occur. Therefore, in this research, X and Y coordinates of the palm of the right hand are employed as X and Y coordinates of the mouse cursor. Second test is for left-clicking. Possible operations for the left-click include bending a finger and attaching any two types of fingers. In this research, the left-clicking is defined as the action of placing the right index finger tip and the right thumb together, which is easy to imagine from the action of clicking. Specifically, the distance is calculated using the coordinates of the tip of the index finger and thumb, and when the distance is shorter than a given value, it is assumed that the fingers are contacted. Third test is for right-clicking. The right-click operation was performed by placing a finger in the same manner as the left-click. As the specification of Leap Motion Controller, close fingers such as the index finger and the middle finger may cause problems such as erroneously recognizing the middle finger as the index finger. Therefore, in order to prevent misrecognition as much as possible, in this research, a right click is generated when the right little finger and the right thumb are contacted. 3.2.3 Implementation of Mouse Cursor Operations According to the tests, we implemented the program that converts the coordinates of the palm to the coordinates of the mouse cursor as follows:  
  Hand Gesture Input Interface as Native Function of IntelligentBox  
  Using the coordinates of the tip of the thumb (rightBonePos[0][3]), the coordinates of the tip of the index finger (rightBonePos[1][3]), and the coordinates of the tip of the little finger (rightBonePos[4][3]), it is possible to find the distance between the index finger, thumb and little finger by the following expression. If the click judgment starts just after the hand is recognized, the judgment may become wrong when the posture of the fingers is not recognized sufficiently. To prevent this, the variable handtimer is set to delay the start of the judgment. After that, when the distance between the thumb and index finger or little finger is shorter than a given distance, the mouse_event function will be invoked as the left/right clicking, and when the distance exceeds the given distance, it will be treated as the mouse release.  (x1 − x2 )2 + (y1 − y2 )2 + (z1 − z2 )2 (3)

  3.2.4 Results of Mouse Cursor Operations In order to confirm that the implemented program works as expected one, we operated the cursor with Leap Motion Controller using the following procedure. • Connect Leap Motion Controller to PC using a USB cable. • Start IntelligentBox. • Select (Connect with Leap Motion Controller) from the (Leap) tab. This will start the listener and make it ready to receive input from Leap Motion Controller. In this state, if you hold your right hand over Leap Motion Controller, on IntelligentBox. You can see that the mouse cursor moves as shown in Fig. 4. You can see that the hand is moved to the lower left of Leap Motion Controller, and the mouse cursor on IntelligentBox is also moved to the lower left of the window.

  4 Discussion As described in Sect. 3, it can be said that the attempt to introduce Leap Motion Controller into IntelligentBox and operate IntelligentBox with fingers was successful. However, in operating the mouse cursor, when you want to click a small button or one like it, the cursor may blur, making it difficult to align. Possible causes of this problem include the fact that the buttons are small in the first place, blurring occurs due to precision problems with Leap Motion Controller, and when you move your finger with a click action, the position of your palm also moves along with it. To solve this problem, we need to display a large virtual button on the screen of IntelligentBox and make it play the same role as a small button, and keep the sensor part clean to improve the accuracy of Leap Motion Controller. If we use the average of the coordinates of several frames and move the cursor based on this average value, the affection of this problem becomes little, or we should consider a different click operation method. Also, regarding the click operation, it may not work well if the hand is too far from or too close to Leap Motion Controller. In this case, you cannot get the finger information well. In order to solve this, a method such as adjusting the maximum and minimum values of the palm coordinates obtained from Leap Motion Controller in the program should be considered.
