  Call for Technical Papers 
   The 31th Pacific Conference on Computer Graphics and Applications (Pacific Graphics) 2023 is an annual flagship conference of the Asia Graphics Association. As a highly successful conference series, Pacific Graphics provides a premium forum for researchers, developers, practitioners in the Pacific Rim and around the world to present and discuss new problems, solutions, and technologies in computer graphics and related areas. Technical Papers Program will showcase innovative research in Computer Graphics and related areas. We invite submissions of new ideas and encourage all forms of research creativity and originality. We are interested in the practice, experience, novel applications, technological, system, or theoretical papers, with the ambition of setting the standard in the field and stimulating future trends.  
 The Technical Papers Program of Pacific Graphics 2023 consists of two tracks: Full Papers and Short Papers. First, accepted full papers will be presented at Pacific Graphics 2023 and published in a special issue of the Eurographics journal Computer Graphics Forum  . The full papers submissions will undergo a double-blind two-step review process. Second, accepted short papers will be published in the Proceedings of Pacific Graphics 2023 in the EG Digital Library, with an oral presentation at the conference. There is a single stage review cycle for short papers submissions. Full and short papers will be reviewed by the same international program committee for technical quality, novelty, significance, and clarity. Pacific Graphics Technical Papers will all be presented in the EG Digital Library.  
 We encourage submissions from all areas related to computer graphics, including but not limited to rendering, modeling, animation, simulation, visualization, virtual and augmented reality, display technology, image processing, computational imaging, computational fabrication, human-computer interaction, and deep learning techniques applied to graphics problems.  
 Pacific Graphics 2023 will be hosted at Daejeon Convention Center, Daejeon, South Korea on October 10th–13th, 2023. Daejeon is located in the center of South Korea and there are high-tech industries, national research centers, and a renowned science and technology university of Korea, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). The conference convention center is also located in the science park, a popular destination for locals and tourists alike, with a variety of exhibits, recreational activities. Other popular attractions include the National Science Museum, which features interactive exhibits on science and technology, and the Daejeon Museum of Art, which accommodates a collection of modern and contemporary art, and the Daejeon Arts Center, which hosts a wide variety of performances, including concerts, musicals, operas, and dance performances. These attract many visitors to the city, making it a variant and youthful place to live. Overall, Deajeon is a modern and dynamic city with a rich cultural heritage and many attractions to explore. Coming to PG 2023 will also be an opportunity for the international community to discover Korea and its prestigious laboratories at KAIST, especially for their research in computer science and vision.  
 Participants of Pacific Graphics 2023 will be able to attend presentations of the latest advances in computer graphics and imaging from research and industry experts. It is also going to be a great opportunity to meet with international researchers in the domain and socialize around the conference social events.

 Submission dates   
 Submission details   
 Electronic submissions of all full and short papers are mandatory and will be conducted using the Submission and Review Management (SRMv2)  system. Paper submissions must be written in English, must be anonymized   , and must be formatted according to the Eurographics Computer Graphics Forum guidelines. The publication guidelines and LaTeX templates are available on SRMv2  . Accepted papers must be presented orally in English at Pacific Graphics 2023. Review of full/short papers is based on a double-blind reviewing approach, so please be sure to remove all personal data (such as authors, affiliations, acknowledgements, etc.) from the submissions. References to the authors’ own work should be made in the third person to maintain anonymity. Reviewers are asked to keep confidential all materials sent to them for evaluation.  
 Full papers track: there is no maximum length imposed on full paper submissions. However, full paper submissions should only be as long as they need to be, but not longer. Reviewers might rank submissions perceived as being either repetitive or unnecessarily long lower than they would score concisely written papers.  
 Short papers track: short paper submissions cannot be longer than 7 pages (excluding references). There is no limit on the length of the reference section. Short paper submissions will be declined without review if they exceed the above page limit.  
 Authors of the accepted technical papers will present a short summary or a teaser during a fast-forward session. This presentation will be around 25 seconds and can be augmented by slides. To ensure a smooth organization, they will be asked to prepare a short video of the slides for this purpose, in two versions: one with the spoken text and one without. Details will be sent to the authors of the accepted papers.  
 Plagiarism   
 A submission to the Pacific Graphics 2023 Technical program should describe the original work of the authors. Authors must not use ideas or content originating from others without properly crediting their original sources. Note that such sources are not limited to peer-reviewed publications but also include patents, textbooks, technical reports, theses, unpublished work posted on arXiv, and other posts on the World Wide Web. Failure to comply with this requirement will be considered plagiarism and result in rejection.  
 Prior Art   
 Authors are expected to cite, discuss differences and novelty, and compare results, if applicable, with respect to relevant existing publications, provided they have been published in a peer-reviewed venue. This also applies to patents, which also undergo a professional reviewing process. But what about technical reports, and other non-peer-reviewed publications, such as technical reports or papers posted on arXiv, which we henceforth refer to as pre-publications? With the rapid progress of search engines and the increased perusal of arXiv papers by the scientific community, asking authors to thoroughly compare their work to these pre-publications imposes an unreasonable burden — a seemingly relevant report that is incomplete in its disclosure or validation might appear online shortly before the deadline. Although peer-reviewed publications are certainly not immune to these shortcomings, they have, at least, been judged sufficiently complete and valid by a group of peers. Consequently, authors are not required to discuss and compare their work with recent prepublications (arXiv, technical reports, theses, etc.), although they must properly cite those that inspired them (see “Plagiarism” above). Nevertheless, we encourage authors to mention all related works they are aware of as good academic practice dictates. Note that with new works posted on arXiv on a daily basis, it is increasingly likely that reviewers might point out similarities between the submitted work and online reports that have been missed by the authors. In this case, authors of conditionally accepted papers should be prepared to cite these pre-publications in their final revision as concurrent work, without the burden of having to detail how their work compares to or differs from these pre-publications. When authors cite previous work that they have authored, the citation should be in the third person to preserve anonymity. There are, however, situations where such prior work should not be cited. This is the case if these prior works correspond to prepublications of the submission (arXiv), with largely similar content. In this case, it must be ensured that no publicity related to the publication is available on the web.  
 arXiv policy   
 As authors, putting a submission on a repository like arXiv is allowed, either before submission or during the review cycle. There is no penalty for publishing a submission as a prepublication. However, if there are largely overlapping prepublications of the same authors that are available online at the time of submission (arXiv), earlier or largely similar versions of the submission should not be cited in the submission because this would identify the authors. This is consistent with the submission guidelines at SIGGRAPH and CVPR/ECCV/ICCV. If an author is applying for jobs during the review cycle, it is allowed, as an exception, to list a submission as ‘under review at Pacific Graphics’ in the author’s CV.  
 After submission, the authors should try to preserve the anonymity of the submission. Authors must not discuss the submitted research with social or regular media that includes blogs and news articles, as well as publicize via media segments of universities and/or research institutes. Please do not advertise the work on social media or list it on web pages as ‘under review at Pacific Graphics’.  
 Double Submission Policy   
 By submitting a manuscript to the Pacific Graphics Technical Papers program, authors acknowledge that the technical contributions they claim have not been previously published or accepted for publication in another peer-reviewed venue and that no manuscript substantially similar in content is currently under review. Also, double submissions for both tracks simultaneously are not allowed. Violations constitute grounds for rejection.  
 Re-submitted Material   
 For papers that have previously been reviewed by other venues and have been rejected or withdrawn, the authors are encouraged to provide a cover letter to describe the history of the paper (however, this does not imply reviewer continuity). This cover letter can also answer the comments made in the previous reviews, by either listing the changes that were made to comply with them or discussing/rebutting/clarifying some elements if need be. Though not mandatory, this procedure is strongly encouraged. The cover letter has to be submitted through SRM as an ‘Additional Attachment’ (see the last section of the SRM upload form for details).  
 Rebuttal, Notification, Publication, and Prizes   
 The | reviews | will be made available to the authors on | July 21, 2023 | . During a rebuttal period from | July 21 to July 28, 2023 | , authors will be able to submit a brief document to address any factual errors or clarify any issues raised by reviews.

 Welcome to PKAW 2023  
 PKAW has provided a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss the state-of-the-art in the areas of knowledge acquisition and machine intelligence (MI, also Artificial Intelligence, AI). PKAW2023 will continue the above focus and welcome the contributions to the multi-disciplinary approach of human and big data-driven knowledge acquisition and AI techniques and applications.  
 AI is changing the way in which organizations innovate and communicate their processes, products and services. Also, in our daily life, AI-embedded devices such as smart speakers are about to become widely used, which extends the possibility of acquiring knowledge from users’ behavior observed through the interaction between those devices and their users. Knowledge acquisition and learning from big data are becoming more challenging than ever. Various knowledge can be acquired not only from human experts but also from heterogeneous data. Multidisciplinary research, including knowledge engineering, artificial intelligence and machine learning, human-computer interaction, etc., is required to meet the challenge. We invite authors to submit papers on all aspects of these areas.  
 Furthermore, not only in the engineering field but also in the social science field (e.g., economics social networks, and sociology), recent progress in knowledge acquisition and data engineering techniques is realizing interesting applications. We also invite submissions that present applications tested and deployed in real-life settings and lessons learned during this process.

 To smoothly publish your work in the Springer proceedings, you must submit the camera-ready paper, source files, and the signed and completed copyright transfer form  by 15 September 2023  . You need to submit the files using your EasyChair author account, as follows:  
 Log into Easychair, select the author role, and go to your accepted paper(s). 
  Go to "Add or update files". 
  Upload required files correspondingly. You don't need to update the original submission, but just upload the required camera-ready paper, source files, and the signed and completed copyright transfer form. 
  Camera-ready Copy and Source files Submission  
 Please follow the Submission Instruction to upload two files:  
 Either a zipped file containing all your LaTeX sources (LaTeX files with all the associated style files, special fonts, eps files and the underlying bib file for the references); | OR a Word file in RTF format, and 
  PDF version of your camera-ready paper. 
  Please follow strictly the "Springer Author Instructions"  when preparing the final version. Download  and use the correct template (either in Latex or MS Word) to prepare your final camera-copy paper. Papers must be in trouble-free, high-resolution PDF format.

 Workshop #1: The Principle and practice of data and Knowledge Acquisition Workshop (PKAW 2023)  
 Introduction:  This workshop intends to provide a chance for intensive discussion on knowledge acquisition and data engineering with theoretical aspects as well as their implementations. In this era of entering the practical use of AI, unprecedented evolutions are expected to emerge in many industries and society. AI is changing the way in which organizations execute their business processes and provide their products or services. Also, in our daily life, AI-embedded devices such as smart speakers are about to become widely used, which extends the possibility of acquiring knowledge from users' behavior observed through the interaction between those devices and their users. With this perspective, this workshop focuses on multidisciplinary research, including knowledge engineering, machine learning, natural language processing, and human-computer interaction. Also, the research on the implementation, such as applications, and data platforms, including their industrial/social impacts, are the focus of the workshop. In engineering and social science fields (e.g., economics, social networks, and sociology), recent progress in knowledge acquisition and data engineering techniques is realizing interesting applications.  
 Organizers:  Shiqing Wu, Wenli Yang and Muhammad Bilal Amin  
 Workshop #2: The 2nd Symposium on Artificial Intelligence for the Environment (AI4Environment)  
 Introduction:  As Artificial Intelligence (AI) drives changes to enhance productivity and prolong lifespans, a dual concern is the environmental sustainability of scarce planetary resources. Effective management of environmental assets and reducing our impact on sensitive ecosystems are becoming critical issues. AI has the potential to accelerate global efforts to protect the environment and conserve resources through renewable energy systems, driving energy emission reductions, CO2 removal, developing greener transportation networks, monitoring deforestation, and planning for extreme weather conditions. This workshop aims to explore the emerging applications of AI as it relates to environmental conservation and management. The first successful run of the symposium was held in Australasian Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence in 2022. This year, we would like to take to the regional level. As we know many countries in the pacific rim region are facing environmental challenges. We hope to attract researchers from these countries.

 Workshop #4: The 3rd International Workshop on Democracy and AI (DemocrAI2023 Winter)  
 Introduction:  This workshop will explore how AI research can contribute to solving challenging problems by current-day communities. For example, what role can AI play in promoting conversational democracy? Specifically, this workshop studies literature in three distinct areas: (i) the impact of AI on democracy as a meaningful conversation; (ii) the importance of automated facilitation and decision-making methodologies and tools in social platforms; and (iii) the importance of experiments in democracy and its social impact. This workshop will bring together multidisciplinary researchers across AI and Social research and application domains. The objective is to share the current state of research and practice, explore emerging directions, and create opportunities across different strands of AI and Social research for collaboration. This workshop complements the objectives of the main conference by providing a forum for researchers, practitioners, educators and users in AI and such as those working in the areas of innovative and impactful real-world applications for social and democracy good.

 Public-Key Cryptography – PKC 2023  
 26th IACR International Conference on Practice and Theory of Public-Key Cryptography, Atlanta, GA, USA, May 7–10, 2023, Proceedings, Part I  
 herausgegeben von: Alexandra Boldyreva, Vladimir Kolesnikov   
 Some starting steps were taken by Grubbs et al.  (EUROCRYPT 2022) and Xagawa (EUROCRYPT 2022) wherein they studied the anonymity properties of most NIST PQC third round candidate KEMs. Unfortunately, they were unable to show the anonymity of Kyber because of certain technical barriers.   
 In this paper, we overcome said barriers and resolve the open problems posed by Grubbs et al.  (EUROCRYPT 2022) and Xagawa (EUROCRYPT 2022) by establishing the anonymity of Kyber, and the (hybrid) PKE schemes derived from it, in a post-quantum setting. Along the way, we also provide an approach to obtain tight IND-CCA security proofs for Kyber with concrete  bounds; this resolves another issue identified by the aforementioned works related to the post-quantum IND-CCA security claims of Kyber from a provable security point-of-view. Our results also extend to Saber, a NIST PQC third round finalist, in a similar fashion.

  Abstract   
 The post-quantum security of cryptographic schemes assumes that the quantum adversary only receives the classical result of computations with the secret key. Further, it is unknown whether the post-quantum secure schemes still remain secure if the adversary can obtain a superposition state of the results.   
 In this paper, we formalize one class of public-key encryption schemes named oracle-masked schemes. Then we define the plaintext extraction procedure for those schemes and this procedure simulates the quantum-accessible decryption oracle with a certain loss.   
 POLKA: Towards Leakage-Resistant Post-quantum CCA-Secure Public Key Encryption  
  Abstract   
 As for any cryptographic algorithm, the deployment of post-quantum CCA-secure public key encryption schemes may come with the need to be protected against side-channel attacks. For existing post-quantum schemes that have not been developed with leakage in mind, recent results showed that the cost of these protections can make their implementations more expensive by orders of magnitude. In this paper, we describe a new design, coined POLKA  , that is specifically tailored to reduce this cost. It leverages various ingredients in order to enable efficient side-channel protected implementations such as: (i) the rigidity property (which intuitively means that the de-randomized encryption and decryption are injective functions) to avoid the very leaky re-encryption step of the Fujisaki-Okamoto transform, (ii) the randomization of the decryption thanks to the incorporation of a dummy ciphertext, removing the adversary’s control of its intermediate computations and making these computations ephemeral, (iii) key-homomorphic computations that can be masked against side-channel attacks with overheads that scale linearly in the number of shares, (iv) hard physical learning problems to argue about the security of some critical unmasked operations. Furthermore, we use an explicit rejection mechanism (returning an error symbol for invalid ciphertexts) to avoid the additional leakage caused by implicit rejection. As a result, the operations of POLKA  can be protected against leakage in a cheaper way than state-of-the-art designs, opening the way towards schemes that are both quantum-safe and leakage-resistant.

 Security Analysis of RSA-BSSA  
  Abstract   
 In a blind signature scheme, a user can obtain a digital signature on a message of her choice without revealing anything about the message or the resulting signature to the signer. Blind signature schemes have recently found applications for privacy-preserving web browsing and ad ecosystems, and as such, are ripe for standardization. In this paper, we show that the recent proposed standard of Denis, Jacobs and Wood [ 16  , 17  ] constitutes a strongly one-more-unforgeable blind signature scheme in the random-oracle model under the one-more-RSA assumption. Further, we show that the blind version of RSA-FDH proposed and analyzed by Bellare, Namprempre, Pointcheval and Semanko [ 6  ] does not satisfy blindness when the public key is chosen maliciously, but satisfies a weaker notion of a blind token.

 Extendable Threshold Ring Signatures with Enhanced Anonymity  
  Abstract   
 Threshold ring signatures are digital signatures that allow t  parties to sign a message while hiding their identity in a larger set of n  users called “ring”. Recently, Aranha et al. [PKC 2022] introduced the notion of extendable  threshold ring signatures ( \(\textsf{ETRS}\)  ). \(\textsf{ETRS}\)  allow one to update, in a non-interactive manner, a threshold ring signature on a certain message so that the updated signature has a greater threshold, and/or an augmented set of potential signers. An application of this primitive is anonymous count me in. A first signer creates a ring signature with a sufficiently large ring announcing a proposition in the signed message. After such cause becomes public  , other parties can anonymously decide to support that proposal by producing an updated signature. Crucially, such applications rely on partial signatures being posted on a publicly accessible  bulletin board since users may not know/trust each other.   
 In this paper, we first point out that even if anonymous count me in was suggested as an application of \(\textsf{ETRS}\)  , the anonymity notion proposed in the previous work is insufficient in many application scenarios. Indeed, the existing notion guarantees anonymity only against adversaries who just see the last signature, and are not allowed to access the “full evolution” of an \(\textsf{ETRS}\)  . This is in stark contrast with applications where partial signatures are posted in a public bulletin board. We therefore propose stronger anonymity definitions and construct a new \(\textsf{ETRS}\)  that satisfies such definitions. Interestingly, while satisfying stronger anonymity properties, our \(\textsf{ETRS}\)  asymptotically improves on the two \(\textsf{ETRS}\)  presented in prior work [PKC 2022] in terms of both time complexity and signature size. Our \(\textsf{ETRS}\)  relies on extendable non-interactive witness-indistinguishable proof of knowledge ( \(\textsf{ENIWI}\)  PoK), a novel technical tool that we formalize and construct, and that may be of independent interest. We build our constructions from pairing groups under the SXDH assumption.

  Abstract   
 When multiple users have power or rights, there is always the risk of corruption or abuse. Whereas there is no solution to avoid those malicious behaviors, from the users themselves or from external adversaries, one can strongly deter them with tracing capabilities that will later help to revoke the rights or negatively impact the reputation. On the other hand, privacy is an important issue in many applications, which seems in contradiction with traceability.   
 In this paper, we first extend usual tracing techniques based on codes so that not just one contributor can be traced but the full collusion. In a second step, we embed suitable codes into a set \(\mathcal V\)  of vectors in such a way that, given a vector \(\textbf{U}\in \textsf{span}(\mathcal V)\)  , the underlying code can be used to efficiently find a minimal subset \(\mathcal X \subseteq \mathcal V\)  such that \(\textbf{U}\in \textsf{span}(\mathcal X)\)  .   
 To meet privacy requirements, we then make the vectors of \(\textsf{span}(\mathcal V)\)  anonymous while keeping the efficient tracing mechanism. As an interesting application, we formally define the notion of linearly-homomorphic group signatures and propose a construction from our codes: multiple signatures can be combined to sign any linear subspace in an anonymous way, but a tracing authority is able to trace back all the contributors involved in the signatures of that subspace.   
  Abstract   
 In this paper we put forward new SSLE solutions that advance the state of the art both from a theoretical and a practical front. On the theoretical side we propose a new definition of SSLE in the universal composability framework. We believe this to be the right way to model security in highly concurrent contexts such as those of many blockchain related applications. Next, we propose a UC-realization of SSLE from public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) and based on the ability of distributing the PEKS key generation and encryption algorithms. Finally, we give a concrete PEKS scheme with efficient distributed algorithms for key generation and encryption and that allows us to efficiently instantiate our abstract SSLE construction.   
 Our resulting SSLE protocol is very efficient, does not require participants to store any state information besides their secret keys and guarantees so called on-chain efficiency  : the information to verify an election in the new block should be of size at most logarithmic in the number of participants. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient SSLE scheme achieving this property.   
  Abstract   
 GIMPS and PrimeGrid are large-scale distributed projects dedicated to searching giant prime numbers, usually of special forms like Mersenne and Proth primes. The numbers in the current search-space are millions of digits large and the participating volunteers need to run resource-consuming primality tests. Once a candidate prime N  has been found, the only way for another party to independently verify the primality of N  used to be by repeating the expensive primality test. To avoid the need for second recomputation of each primality test, these projects have recently adopted certifying mechanisms that enable efficient verification of performed tests. However, the mechanisms presently in place only detect benign errors and there is no guarantee against adversarial behavior: a malicious volunteer can mislead the project to reject a giant prime as being non-prime.   
 In this paper, we propose a practical, cryptographically-sound mechanism for certifying the non-primality of Proth numbers. That is, a volunteer can – parallel to running the primality test for N  – generate an efficiently verifiable proof at a little extra cost certifying that N  is not prime. The interactive protocol has statistical soundness and can be made non-interactive using the Fiat-Shamir heuristic.   
 Multi-Client Inner Product Encryption: Function-Hiding Instantiations Without Random Oracles  
  Abstract   
 In a Multi-Client Functional Encryption (MCFE) scheme, n  clients each obtain a secret encryption key from a trusted authority. During each time step t  , each client i  can encrypt its data using its secret key. The authority can use its master secret key to compute a functional key given a function f  , and the functional key can be applied to a collection of n  clients’ ciphertexts encrypted to the same time step, resulting in the outcome of f  on the clients’ data. In this paper, we focus on MCFE for inner-product  computations.   
 If an MCFE scheme hides not only the clients’ data, but also the function f  , we say it is function hiding  . Although MCFE for inner-product computation has been extensively studied, how to achieve function privacy is still poorly understood. The very recent work of Agrawal et al. showed how to construct a function-hiding  MCFE scheme for inner-product assuming standard bilinear group assumptions; however, they assume the existence of a random oracle and prove only a relaxed, selective security notion. An intriguing open question is whether we can achieve function-hiding MCFE for inner-product without  random oracles.   
 In this work, we are the first to show a function-hiding MCFE scheme for inner products, relying on standard bilinear group assumptions. Further, we prove adaptive  security without the use of a random oracle. Our scheme also achieves succinct ciphertexts, that is, each coordinate in the plaintext vector encrypts to only O  (1) group elements.   
  Abstract   
 Secure communication is gained by combining encryption with authentication. In real-world applications encryption commonly takes the form of KEM-DEM hybrid encryption, which is combined with ideal authentication. The pivotal question is how weak the employed key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) is allowed to be to still yield universally composable (UC) secure communication when paired with symmetric encryption and ideal authentication. This question has so far been addressed for public-key encryption (PKE) only, showing that encryption does not need to be stronger than sender-binding CPA, which binds the CPA secure ciphertext non-malleably to the sender ID. For hybrid encryption, prior research unanimously reaches for CCA2 secure encryption which is unnecessarily strong. Answering this research question is vital to develop more efficient and feasible protocols for real-world secure communication and thus enable more communication to be conducted securely.   
 In this paper we use ideas from the PKE setting to develop new answers for hybrid encryption. We develop a new and significantly weaker security notion—sender-binding CPA for KEMs—which is still strong enough for secure communication. By using game-based notions as building blocks, we attain secure communication in the form of ideal functionalities with proofs in the UC-framework. Secure communication is reached in both the classic as well as session context by adding authentication and one-time/replayable CCA secure symmetric encryption respectively. We furthermore provide an efficient post-quantum secure LWE-based construction in the standard model giving an indication of the real-world benefit resulting from our new security notion. Overall we manage to make significant progress on discovering the minimal security requirements for hybrid encryption components to facilitate secure communication.

 Functional encryption features secret keys, each associated with a key function f  , which allow to directly recover f  ( x  ) from an encryption of x  , without learning anything more about x  . This property is particularly useful when delegating data processing to a third party as it allows the latter to perform its task while ensuring minimum data leakage. However, this generic term conceals a great diversity in the cryptographic constructions that strongly differ according to the functions f  they support.   
 A recent series of works has focused on the ability to search a pattern within a data stream, which can be expressed as a function f  . One of the conclusions of these works was that this function f  was not supported by the current state-of-the-art, which incited their authors to propose a new primitive called Stream Encryption supporting Pattern Matching (SEPM). Some concrete constructions were proposed but with some limitations such as selective security or reliance on non-standard assumptions.   
 In this paper, we revisit the relations between this primitive and two major subclasses of functional encryption, namely Hidden Vector Encryption (HVE) and Inner Product Encryption (IPE). We indeed first exhibit a generic transformation from HVE to SEPM, which immediately yields new efficient SEPM constructions with better features than existing ones. We then revisit the relations between HVE and IPE and show that we can actually do better than the transformation proposed by Katz, Sahai and Waters in their seminal paper on predicate encryption. This allows to fully leverage the vast state-of-the-art on IPE which contains adaptively secure constructions proven under standard assumptions. This results in countless new SEPM constructions, with all the features one can wish for. Beyond that, we believe that our work sheds a new light on the relations between IPE schemes and HVE schemes and in particular shows that some of the former are more suitable to construct the latter.
