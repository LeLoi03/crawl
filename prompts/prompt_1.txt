 Title  : Online Algorithms with Advice  
 Abstract:  Online algorithms have to make decisions without knowing the full input. A well-know example is caching: Which page should we discard from a cache when there is no more space left? The classical way to analyze the performance of online algorithms is the competitive ratio: How much worse is the result of an optimization problem relative to the optimal result. A different and relative new viewpoint is the advice complexity: How much information about the future does an online algorithm need in order to become optimal? Or, similarly, how much can we improve the competitive ratio with a given amount of information about the future? In this talk we will look at the growing list of known results about online algorithms with advice and the interesting problems that occured when the pioneers of the field came up with the definition of this model.  
 Biography:  Peter Rossmanith is a professor of Theoretical Computer Science at RWTH Aachen University in Germany. He is mainly interested in Efficient Algorithms, but also likes to look at all other aspects in Computer Science and Mathematics including Computer Science Education. He is the author of more than one hundred scientific publications, has been on the program committee of numerous conference, and is associate editor of Computer Science Review. He is a board member of the German Computer Science Faculty Association and chairman of the committee that designs the tasks for the Federal Computer Science Competition in Germany.

  Welcome to the AAAI 23 conference!  
 This year we welcome you to interact in person, online and remotely. In addition to in person events, registered attendees can participate at your convenience through prerecorded talk presentations and online forums.  
    For those arriving in person, please look for the main entrance to the South Building from Mount Vernon Place. If you are connecting from the Marriott Marquis, please see our Know Before You Go  page for detailed instructions.  
 For those who can’t be with us in person, you can participate in live talks remotely with your questions, or to deliver your talk. To access the conference content, go here for:  Technical Program; Bridges  , Tutorial and Lab Forum  ; and Workshops Program  (Access is specific to your registration type).  
 The Mobi conference planner will help you plan for interesting sessions, plan coffee breaks with friends, and help rearrange your travel if needed. To arrange your sessions, Mobi’s planner can help you search for interesting topics and talks by friends, come up with a schedule, and suggest options to fill in the gaps.  
  The purpose of the AAAI conference series  is to promote research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and foster scientific exchange between researchers, practitioners, scientists, students, and engineers across the entirety of AI and its affiliated disciplines. AAAI-23 is the Thirty-Seventh AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. The theme of this conference is to create collaborative bridges within and beyond AI. Like previous AAAI conferences, AAAI-23 will feature technical paper presentations, special tracks, invited speakers, workshops, tutorials, poster sessions, senior member presentations, competitions, and exhibit programs, and two new activities: a Bridge Program and a Lab Program. Many of these activities are tailored to the theme of bridges and all are selected according to the highest standards, with additional programs for students and young researchers.  
 Collaborative Bridge Theme  Driven by its disciplinary diversity, AAAI has incubated numerous AI sub-disciplines and conferences and has nurtured for decades the cohesion of AI. New communities often emerge when two or more disciplines come together in order to explore new opportunities and perspectives; today both are plentiful. The purpose of this year’s Bridge Program is to tap into new sources of innovation by cultivating sustained collaboration between two or more communities, directed towards a common goal. Our interpretation of bridge is broad and encompasses disciplines both within and outside of AI. Hence, the communities that our Bridge Program is intended to bring together could be distinct subfields of AI, such as planning and learning, or different disciplines that contribute to and benefit from AI, such as AI and the humanities. Follow this link for some of the ways that you can participate in this year’s Bridge theme.   
 We plan for AAAI-23 to be an in-person conference and are exploring opportunities to complement this with remote participation. Given the volatile situation, however, the exact format of the conference can only be decided at a later stage.

 Collaborative Bridge Theme  
 Driven by its disciplinary diversity, AAAI has incubated numerous AI sub-disciplines and conferences and has nurtured for decades the cohesion of AI. New communities often emerge when two or more disciplines come together in order to explore new opportunities and perspectives; today both are plentiful. The purpose of this year’s Bridge Program is to tap into new sources of innovation by cultivating sustained collaboration between two or more communities, directed towards a common goal. Our interpretation of bridge is broad and encompasses disciplines both within and outside of AI.

 Topics  
 AAAI-23 welcomes submissions reporting research that advances artificial intelligence, broadly conceived. The conference scope includes machine learning (deep learning, statistical learning, etc), natural language processing, computer vision, data mining, multiagent systems, knowledge representation, human-in-the-loop AI, search, planning, reasoning, robotics and perception, and ethics. In addition to fundamental work focused on any one of these areas we expressly encourage work that cuts across technical areas of AI, (e.g., machine learning and computer vision; computer vision and natural language processing; or machine learning and planning), bridges between AI and a related research area (e.g., neuroscience; cognitive science) or develops AI techniques in the context of important application domains, such as healthcare, sustainability, transportation, and commerce.  
 The set of AAAI-23 keywords is available on the AAAI-23 keywords page  . This author’s guide for choosing the best keywords  describes important considerations in selecting keywords for a paper.  
 Most papers in AAAI-23 will be part of the main track. All main track papers will be reviewed according to the same criteria and via the same process. This conference has two additional tracks, which focus on AI for Social Impact and Safe and Robust AI. Papers in these two tracks will be reviewed according to a different evaluation rubric than papers in the main track. The same reviewing schedule will be followed for all papers.  
 Track on AI for Social Impact   
 As in past years, AAAI-23 will include a Track on AI for Social Impact (AISI). Submissions to this track will be reviewed according to a rubric that emphasizes the fit between the techniques used and a problem of social importance, rather than simply rewarding technical novelty. In particular, reviewers will assess significance of the problem being addressed; the paper’s engagement with previous literature on the application problem (whether in the AI literature or elsewhere); both novelty of and justification for the proposed AI-based approach; quality of evaluation; facilitation of follow-up work; and overall scope and promise for social impact. Further details are available at the AISI page  .  
 Authors should think carefully about which track is most appropriate for their work. For example, a paper that emphasizes methodological contributions and makes weak connections to a social impact application may stand more chance of acceptance in the main technical track.  
 Track on Safe and Robust AI   
 This year we are introducing a new special track on AI systems that are safe and robust. AI is increasingly being deployed throughout society. To ensure that this technology is trustworthy, it needs to be robust to disturbance, failure and novel circumstances. Furthermore, the technology needs to offer assurance that it will reasonably avoid unsafe, irrecoverable situations. Submissions to this track will be reviewed according to a rubric that emphasizes the fit between the driving requirements of safety and robustness for AI systems and the methods and formalisms presented. Further details are available at the SRAI page  .  
 Authors should think carefully about which track is most appropriate for their work. For example, a paper that emphasizes methodological contributions and makes weak connections to a social impact application or weak connections to problems fundamental to safety and robustness may stand more chance of acceptance in the main technical track.  
 Review Criteria   
 AAAI is a highly selective conference. Prospective authors are therefore strongly encouraged to submit only their very best work to AAAI.  
 All submissions will be rigorously evaluated by expert reviewers to assess whether the contributions of the paper are substantive enough to warrant publication in AAAI.  
 The contributions may be theoretical, methodological, algorithmic, empirical, or integrative (connecting ideas and methods across disparate subfields of AI), or critical (e.g., principled analyses and arguments that draw attention to fundamentally wrong choice of goals, assumptions, or approaches). Evaluation of submissions to the AI for Social Impact track should emphasize demonstrated or potential impact of the research in addressing pressing societal challenges, e.g., health, food, environment, education, governance, among others. Evaluation of submissions to the Safe and Robust AI track should demonstrate focussed, tangible progress towards AI systems that are safe and robust, either at the theoretical and practical level.  
 All submissions will be evaluated and scored for the significance and novelty of the contributions (research problems or questions addressed, methods, experiments, analyses), theoretical and/or empirical soundness of the claims, their relevance to the AAAI community, and clarity of exposition.  
 Additional considerations include adherence to responsible research practices (e.g., with respect to human subject studies, use of sensitive data, as well as data and algorithmic bias), and of steps to ensure reproducibility of research results (e.g., by providing detailed proofs, documenting experiments, sharing data, and sharing code).  
 Solid, technical papers that explore new territory or point out new directions for research, or introduce new problems, address research questions, or introduce methods that are of interest beyond a single sub-area of AI are preferred to papers that advance the state of the art, but only incrementally, or only within a narrow sub-area of AI.
