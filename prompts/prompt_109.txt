 About 
  Call for Papers 
 The Haskell Symposium presents original research on Haskell, discusses practical experience and future development of the language, and promotes other forms of declarative programming.  
 Topics of interest include:  
 Language design, with a focus on possible extensions and modifications of Haskell as well as critical discussions of the status quo; 
  Theory, such as formal semantics of the present language or future extensions, type systems, effects, metatheory, and foundations for program analysis and transformation; 
  Implementations, including program analysis and transformation, static and dynamic compilation for sequential, parallel, and distributed architectures, memory management, as well as foreign function and component interfaces; 
  Libraries, that demonstrate new ideas or techniques for functional programming in Haskell; 
  Tools, such as profilers, tracers, debuggers, preprocessors, and testing tools; 
  Applications, to scientific and symbolic computing, databases, multimedia, telecommunication, the web, and so forth; 
  Functional Pearls, being elegant and instructive programming examples; 
  Experience Reports, to document general practice and experience in education, industry, or other contexts; 
  Tutorials, to document how to use a particular language feature, programming technique, tool or library within the Haskell ecosystem 
  System Demonstrations, based on running software rather than novel research results.

 Call for Papers  
 The ACM SIGPLAN Haskell Symposium 2023 will be co-located with the 2023 International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP).  
 The Haskell Symposium presents original research on Haskell, discusses practical experience and future development of the language, and promotes other forms of declarative programming.  
 Topics of interest include:  
 Language design, with a focus on possible extensions and modifications of Haskell as well as critical discussions of the status quo; 
  Theory, such as formal semantics of the present language or future extensions, type systems, effects, metatheory, and foundations for program analysis and transformation; 
  Implementations, including program analysis and transformation, static and dynamic compilation for sequential, parallel, and distributed architectures, memory management, as well as foreign function and component interfaces; 
  Libraries, that demonstrate new ideas or techniques for functional programming in Haskell; 
  Tools, such as profilers, tracers, debuggers, preprocessors, and testing tools; 
  Applications, to scientific and symbolic computing, databases, multimedia, telecommunication, the web, and so forth; 
  Functional Pearls, being elegant and instructive programming examples; 
  Experience Reports, to document general practice and experience in education, industry, or other contexts; 
  Tutorials, to document how to use a particular language feature, programming technique, tool or library within the Haskell ecosystem; 
  System Demonstrations, based on running software rather than novel research results. 
  Regular papers should explain their research contributions in both general and technical terms, identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant, and relating it to previous work, and to other languages where appropriate.  
 Experience reports and functional pearls need not necessarily report original academic research results. For example, they may instead report reusable programming idioms, elegant ways to approach a problem, or practical experience that will be useful to other users, implementers, or researchers. The key criterion for such a paper is that it makes a contribution from which other Haskellers can benefit. It is not enough simply to describe a standard solution to a standard programming problem, or report on experience where you used Haskell in the standard way and achieved the result you were expecting.  
 Like an experience report and a functional pearl, tutorials should make a contribution from which other Haskellers can benefit. What distinguishes a tutorial is that its focus is on explaining an aspect of the Haskell language and/or ecosystem in a way that is generally useful to a Haskell audience. Tutorials for many such topics can be found online; the distinction here is that by writing it up for formal review it will be vetted by experts and formally published.  
 System demonstrations should summarize the system capabilities that would be demonstrated. The proposals will be judged on whether the ensuing session is likely to be important and interesting to the Haskell community at large, whether on grounds academic or industrial, theoretical or practical, technical, social or artistic. Please contact the program chair with any questions about the relevance of a proposal.  
 If your contribution is not a research paper, please mark the title of your experience report, functional pearl, tutorial or system demonstration as such, by supplying a subtitle (Experience Report, Functional Pearl, Tutorial Paper, System Demonstration).  
 Submission Details   
 Formatting   
 Submitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF), formatted using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines. Authors should use the acmart  format, with the sigplan  sub-format for ACM proceedings. For details, see:  
 It is recommended to use the review  option when submitting a paper; this option enables line numbers for easy reference in reviews.  
 Functional pearls, experience reports, tutorials and demo proposals should be labelled clearly as such.  
 Lightweight Double-blind Reviewing   
 Haskell Symposium 2023 will use a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. To facilitate this, submitted papers must adhere to two rules:  
 Author names and institutions must be omitted, and 
  References to authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work” but rather "We build on the work of "). 
  The purpose of this process is to help the reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult (e.g., important background references should not be omitted or anonymized). In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas.  
 A reviewer will learn the identity of the author(s) of a paper after a review is submitted.  
 Page Limits   
 The length of submissions should not exceed the following limits:  
 Regular paper: 12 pages 
  Functional pearl: 12 pages 
  Tutorial: 12 pages 
  Experience report: 6 pages 
  Demo proposal: 2 pages 
  There is no requirement that all pages are used. For example, a functional pearl may be much shorter than 12 pages. In all cases, the list of references is not counted against these page limits.  
 Deadlines   
 Paper submission: 1 June 2023 (Thu) 
  Notification: 4 July 2023 (Tue) 
  Camera-ready Deadline: 18 July (Tue) 
  Deadlines are anywhere on Earth.  
 Submission   
 The paper submission deadline and length limitations are firm. There will be no extensions, and papers violating the length limitations will be summarily rejected.  
 Papers should be submitted through HotCRP at:  
 Improved versions of a paper may be submitted at any point before the submission deadline using the same web interface.  
 Supplementary material: Authors have the option to attach supplementary material to a submission, on the understanding that reviewers may choose not to look at it. This supplementary material should not be submitted as part of the main document; instead, it should be uploaded as a separate PDF document or tarball. Supplementary material should be uploaded at submission time, not by providing a URL in the paper that points to an external repository. Authors can distinguish between anonymized and non-anonymized supplementary material. Anonymized supplementary material will be visible to reviewers immediately; non-anonymized supplementary material will be revealed to reviewers only after they have submitted their review of the paper and learned the identity of the author(s).  
 Resubmitted Papers: authors who submit a revised version of a paper that has previously been rejected by another conference have the option to attach an annotated copy of the reviews of their previous submission(s), explaining how they have addressed these previous reviews in the present submission. If a reviewer identifies him/herself as a reviewer of this previous submission and wishes to see how his/her comments have been addressed, the conference chair will communicate to this reviewer the annotated copy of his/her previous review. Otherwise, no reviewer will read the annotated copies of the previous reviews.  
 Proceedings   
 Accepted papers will be included in the ACM Digital Library. Their authors will be required to choose one of the following options:  
 Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive permission-to-publish license (and, optionally, licenses the work with a Creative Commons license); 
  Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive permission-to-publish license; 
  Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM. 
 Accepted proposals for system demonstrations will be posted on the symposium website but not formally published in the proceedings.  
 Publication date: The official publication date of accepted papers is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 Artifacts   
 Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make auxiliary material (artifacts like source code, test data, etc.) available with their paper. They can opt to have these artifacts published alongside their paper in the ACM Digital Library (copyright of artifacts remains with the authors).

  Call for Talks 
  Lightning Talks 
  The Haskell Implementors’ Workshop is a forum for those involved in implementing Haskell systems, infrastructure, libraries and tools, for people generally involved in implementing Haskell technology. We share our work and discuss future directions and collaborations with others.  
 In 2023, the Haskell Implementors’ Workshop will be co-located with ICFP 2023.  
 The workshop does not have proceedings. Talks and/or demos are proposed by submitting an abstract and selected by a small program committee. The workshop will be informal and interactive, with a flexible timetable and plenty of room for ad-hoc discussion, demos, and impromptu short talks.  
 Remote presentation policy   
 Authors are strongly encouraged to present their work in-person, but may present it remotely if in-person attendance is not possible. In either case the author presenting the work must register for the workshop. Registration for remote participation is significantly cheaper and covers the whole conference. If you are unable to attend in-person or have other scheduling constraints, then please let the workshop organisers know ASAP so that we can take this into account when putting together the schedule.

 Introduction  HIW   
 Call for Talks  
 The 15th Haskell Implementors’ Workshop is to be held alongside ICFP 2023 this year in Seattle. It is a forum for people involved in the design and development of Haskell implementations, tools, libraries, and supporting infrastructure to share their work and to discuss future directions and collaborations with others.  
 Talks and/or demos are proposed by submitting an abstract, and selected by a small program committee. There will be no published proceedings. The workshop will be informal and interactive, with open spaces in the timetable and room for ad-hoc discussion, demos, and lightning talks.  
 Scope and Target Audience   
 It is important to distinguish the Haskell Implementors’ Workshop from the Haskell Symposium which is also co-located with ICFP 2023. The Haskell Symposium is for the publication of Haskell-related research. In contrast, the Haskell Implementors’ Workshop will have no proceedings – although we will aim to make talk videos, slides, and presented data available with the consent of the speakers.  
 The Implementors’ Workshop is an ideal place to describe a Haskell extension, describe works-in-progress, demo a new Haskell-related tool, or even propose future lines of Haskell development. Members of the wider Haskell community are encouraged to attend the workshop – we need your feedback to keep the Haskell ecosystem thriving. Students working with Haskell are especially encouraged to share their work.  
 The scope covers any of the following topics. There may be some topics that people feel we’ve missed, so by all means submit a proposal even if it doesn’t fit exactly into one of these buckets:  
 Compilation techniques 
 We will also have a lightning talks session. These have been very well received in recent years, and we aim to increase the time available to them. Lightning talks should be ~7mins and are scheduled on the day of the workshop. Suggested topics for lightning talks are to present a single idea, a work-in-progress project, a problem to intrigue and perplex Haskell implementors, or simply to ask for feedback and collaborators.  
 Lightning Talks  
 We have a number of slots for lightning talks. Lightning talks will be ~7 minutes and are scheduled on the day of the workshop. Suggested topics for lightning talks are to present a single idea, a work-in-progress project, a problem to intrigue and perplex Haskell implementors, or simply to ask for feedback and collaborators.  
 Lightning talks are proposed by submitting a title and an abstract. Submissions will not be part of the peer-review process. Notification of acceptance will be continuous until slots are full. Accepted lightning talks will be posted on the workshop’s website.

3. HASKELL_2 conference:
The Haskell Symposium |  
   The Haskell  Symposium is an annual symposium organized in affiliation with the International Conference on Functional Programming ( ICFP  ). The symposium is sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery ( ACM  ) under the aegis of the ACM Special Interest Group on Programming Languages ( SIGPLAN  ).  
 Scope  
 The purpose of the Haskell Symposium is to discuss experience with Haskell, and future developments for the language. The scope of the symposium includes all aspects of the design, semantics, theory, application, implementation and teaching of Haskell.  
 Past Haskell Workshops and Symposia  
 2024 | Milan | Proceedings (ACM DL) | J. Garrett Morris | Matthew Pickering 
 2023 | Seattle | Proceedings (ACM DL) | Niki Vazou | Ryan Scott 
 2022 | Ljubljana | Proceedings (ACM DL) | Nadia Polikarpova | Alejandro Serrano 
 Steering Committee   
 Responsibilities  
 The main purpose of the Haskell Symposium Steering Committee is to provide continuity of the symposium and Haskell Implementors' Workshop and to offer help and advice to the current organizer(s) of the symposium.  
 The responsibilities of the steering committee are: To provide continuity of the Haskell Symposium and Haskell Implementors' Workshop serve the Haskell community, and maintain the functional vision and vigour of the symposium and workshop. 
  To officially represent the Haskell Symposium with the sponsoring organization, ACM SIGPLAN, and consult with the SIGPLAN chair on matters of policy and planning. 
  To appoint the Haskell Symposium Program Chair each year in consultation with the SIGPLAN Chair, and approve the Program Chair's choice of Program Committee. 
  To provide help and guidance to the Haskell Symposium Program Chair in the overall technical organization of the symposium, as well with budget preparation and the cooperation with affiliated conferences and workshops. 
  To appoint the Haskell Implementors' Workshop chair each year. 
  To assist in the coordination of the Haskell Symposium with the Haskell Implementors' Workshop. 
  Membership  
 The Haskell Symposium Steering Committee comprises the three previous Haskell Symposium Program Chairs, the current Haskell Symposium Chair two previous Haskell Implementors' Workshop chairs, the current Haskell Implementors' Workshop chair, three appointed Members-At-Large, and as a non-voting ex officio member the vice chair of the SIGPLAN executive committee. 
  Each year, around the date of the Haskell Symposium, the Steering Committee, in consultation with the SIGPLAN Chair, appoints the Program Chair for the next Haskell Symposium. The steering committee additionally appoints a Haskell Implementors' Workshop chair and a new Member-At-Large to succeed the currently longest serving Member-At-Large. The new chairs and the newly appointed Member-At-Large then join the Steering Committee, while the longest serving former chairs and Member-At-Large step down. 
  The chair of the Steering Committee is the longest serving former Haskell Symposium Program Chair. 
  Should there be vacancies within the Steering Committee, e.g. due to a member stepping down early, the Steering Committee appoints members to fill the vacancies and, if necessary, decides on the succession ordering. 
  Current Members  
 Program Committee  
 The Program Committee is responsible for the technical content of the Haskell Symposium. The Haskell Symposium Program Chair, with the approval of the Steering Committee, appoints the Program Committee and leads its work.

 2023 GHC Contributors' Workshop  
 A hands-on introduction to working on GHC, colocated with Zurihac 2023  
 Location:  Rapperswil, Switzerland   
 Dates:  June 7-9, 2023   
 We are excited to announce the 2023 GHC Contributors’ Workshop, June 7-9 2023  , organized by the GHC developers, the Haskell Foundation, and the OST Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences! This is a workshop for those who want to get started working on GHC, those who want to understand GHC’s internals to better diagnose issues with their own code, and those who want to transfer lessons learned in GHC to other compilers. The primary aim of the workshop is to broaden the base of contributors to GHC.  
 In this three-day event, held on the lakeside campus of OST in lovely Rapperswil, Switzerland, you can learn what you need to know in order to get started working on GHC, right from the core team itself. Because the workshop is immediately prior to Zurihac 2023  , there will be time to work on your project and ask questions.  
 In-Person Attendance  
 In-person attendance is now full. For those who have already registered, practical details are listed below.  
 Free Online Participation  
 We will be using Zurihac’s Discord server as a chat platform and livestreaming YouTube. Please fill out this registration form  by June 5 in order to participate. Links to streams will be posted to the Discord server.  
 The Workshop  
 At this workshop, you can learn the ins and outs of working on GHC, including practical techniques for minimizing rebuilds and diagnosing compiler bugs. The fundamental concepts and idioms of key compiler subsystems will be presented, along with tips and tricks for understanding how they are working in a running compiler. This is a practical workshop: any theory presented will be in service of building things, and we expect that you will arrive with a checkout and build of the source tree ready to go.  
 Additionally, the speakers will be available to answer questions and to provide mentorship during Zurihac itself, so this is a great opportunity to finish your first MR.  
 We expect that participants already know Haskell and have worked on some form of programming language implementation in the past, whether as students, at work, or just for fun. Concepts such as parsing, type checking, unification, and code generation should be familiar, but we don’t expect participants to already be experts.  
 Practical Information and Schedule  
 The workshop will be held at the Rapperswil-Jona campus of OST  . It is right next to the Rapperswil train station, at Oberseestrasse 10  . The Zurihac 2023 site  has instructions for transportation between Rapperswil and Zürich.  
 Preparation  
 Swiss power adapter(s), if necessary 
  Refillable water bottle 
  Working account on | gitlab.haskell.org 
  Checked out and built a recent GHC from source 
  Checked out and built the JavaScript backend from source 
 Please check this space for last minute program changes. As of now, the schedule is as follows:  
 2023-06-07 
 2023-06-08 
 2023-06-09 
 All times are in CEST using a 24-hour clock. Speakers have been asked to plan appropriate breaks during their timeslots.  
 We don’t expect every participant to attend every presentation. It’s perfectly acceptable to skip a topic that you’re less interested in so you can hack on a topic that you are interested in, taking advantage of ready access to GHC experts for hands-on assistance.  
 Lunch and Refreshments  
 Duncan Coutts, Well-Typed  
 Duncan has been using Haskell since the end of the last century, founded a Haskell consultancy company fifteen years ago, and has had a hand in various Haskell libraries and tools over the years.  
 Ryan Scott, Galois  
 Participation  
 Due to space constraints and to enable scholarships for student participants, there will be a fee for full on-site participation. Fees will be used to cover travel costs for presenters, other direct costs of running the event, and students who don’t have other funding to attend. The fee depends on participant category:  
  All fees are in US dollars.

  Keynote title: The long and winding road to success in B2B enterprise integration Governance dynamics, Data Platforms, Digital Twins and the promises of AI   
  Abstract: B2B integration has been receiving much interest over the past few decades. The history of B2B enterprise integration has witnessed fascinating successes and dramatic failures. Technology has made spectacular advances, through the emergence of webservices and APIs, Cloud-based integration platforms (iPAAS), data platforms, open data and federated architectures such as data spaces. Recently, digital twins and the rise of scalable AI based integration Agents add to the impressive technology stack that can be brought to the table in B2B projects. Still, the complexity of these projects goes beyond solving technical challenges. Several projects we have studied and contributed to in our research show that achieving sustainable value and success in B2B integration requires a combination of Technical, Ethical, Legal, Social and Business elements. Through a series of examples and longitudinal case studies from various industry sectors, I will show in this talk what lessons were learned and what the researchers can contribute to making B2B integration a less windy road to success.
