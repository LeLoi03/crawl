 "Co-creating  the professional association advancing the quality of immersive learning to benefit humanity and our world." 
  We are happy to announce a Call for Papers for a special issue in the journal "Computers & Education: X Reality", which is organized with iLRN and invites selected papers submitted to and presented at the 9th and 10th iLRN conferences to submit extended versions. However, submissions from the academic community are welcomed, regardless of whether they were part of the iLRN conferences.  
  Overview  
  The integration of immersive technologies—such as Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR)—into educational environments has shown significant potential to transform the learning experience. However, the rapid adoption of these technologies has outpaced the development of comprehensive, evidence-based frameworks that guide their practical implementation and evaluation in diverse educational contexts.  
  Immersive Learning is emerging from multi-disciplinary research in Computer Science, Game Design, UX, the Learning Sciences, and other fields that apply Immersive Learning in context. This special issue of Computers & Education: X Reality aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice in immersive learning by bringing together research that explores theoretical foundations and builds robust frameworks grounded in empirical evidence. We seek contributions that provide insights into how immersive technologies can be systematically integrated into educational settings to enhance learning outcomes, showing effective practices in immersive learning, addressing educational challenges and the technical affordances of tools and frameworks that are both scalable and sustainable.  
  Likewise, we welcome submissions from the academic community, regardless of whether they were part of the iLRN conferences.  
  Topics of Interest  
  This special issue invites scholars, practitioners, and technologists to contribute to the evolving landscape of immersive learning by providing research that advances theoretical understanding and offers practical, evidence-based solutions for educators worldwide.  
  Case studies showcasing the integration of immersive technologies in various educational settings. Design and development of immersive learning environments. Best practices for implementing VR/AR/MR in classrooms, labs, and remote learning contexts. Evidence-Based Frameworks  
  Empirical studies evaluating the effectiveness of immersive learning tools and environments. Longitudinal studies on the impact of immersive learning on student engagement, motivation, and outcomes. Frameworks for assessing and improving the accessibility and usability of immersive learning technologies. Technological Innovations  
  Emerging tools and platforms for immersive learning. Interdisciplinary approaches to enhancing immersive learning experiences. Future trends and challenges in the adoption of XR technologies in education. Submission Guidelines  
  Authors are invited to submit original manuscripts that have not been previously published and are not currently under consideration for publication elsewhere. We expect final articles, not abstracts. All submissions will undergo a rigorous peer-review process. Manuscripts should be prepared according to the journal's standard guidelines and submitted through the Computers & Education: X Reality online submission system: Editorial Manager®.  
  Please refer to the Guide for Authors to prepare the manuscript and select the article type “VSI: Immersive Learning" when submitting your manuscript online.  
  Important Dates  
  Manuscript Submission Deadline: December 15, 2024

Her vision is to continue shaping the content and direction of research in immersive learning and educational technologies, particularly in SCILE.  
  VIRTUAL CAMPUS   Our iLRNetwork Virtual Campus is open!    University student use of the iLRN Virtual Campus XR groups meet for presentations & exploration iLRN Volunteers starting Campus Co-design - now building a spooky Halloween party! Beginning construction of iLRN's Foundations Research Library on campus on the immersive learning principles of Computer Science, Games, & the Learning Sciences Our new iLRN Frame VR Campus opened to attendees of the 10th annual iLRN Conference last June 2024. Of the collection of 25 Frame buildings on the new campus, most iLRN2024 activity took place on the dual Frame campus "hub" - that is, our Orange and Blue Exhibit Halls, respectively - where presenters from BOTH online and face-to-face (Scotland) conference venues had opportunity to place a poster and interact with visitors. Note that both virtual campus halls are always open to iLRN members and these fantastic immersive learning posters are still there for your perusal!  
  Indeed, the campus is crawling with network activity, as various initiatives sprout up in Teaching/Learning, UX/Design, and Research/Knowledge Sharing!  
  A few iLRN Frame VR Campus Highlights:  
  Summer '24, Doug Wilson invited his Learning, Design, and Technology students at George Mason University to meet regularly in our iLRN Student Center and explore the network co-designed FrameVR Campus. Dr. Wilson and iLRN campus staff offered the use of Frame VR's custom permissions to allow students an opportunity to pitch ideas, co-create and try out the campus' possibility spaces. > > > >  
  The Immersive Learning Research Network's campus is open to university member/partners in myriad different ways!  
  game jams or hackathons research talks independent student projects pedagogical or computer science design experiments international co-lab spaces In other campus activity, Randall Rode brought the EduCAUSE XR Community Group to the iLRN campus in August for exploration and discussion in the Circle of Scholars (CoS) amphitheater. Dr. Rode is presently supporting iLRN to co-develop our Community of Scholars in Immersive Learning, including public and members-only meetings in the CoS amphitheater.  
  > > > > > Bring YOUR immersive experience design group or team to the iLRN Campus for exploration or meeting!  
  Now that fall semester has arrived and universities are well underway with courses, the campus has picked up our activity and the iLRN Volunteers are more systematically managing our co-creations and other events on campus. They use our iLRN General Discord Server as a means of collaborating, working across time zones, skill sets, and campus design requests but they're ALWAYS doing something fun too and our twice-a-month meetings are always eye-opening and full of laughter and connections.  
  Lately, we've been working on turning a number of our campus buildings into our "HAUNTED VIRTUAL CAMPUS" - now in our 5th year!  
  (so I guess it's a tradition?). . . .  
  We're putting up some cryptic AI bots who speak of VR like a kooky steampunk character and grumpily invite you to check out other haunted spaces and leave them alone to their alarming experiments...  
  and finally, our lead iLRN Campus Volunteer Sarah Barker has been building a prototype Frame VR Research Library in our House 1, the "trunk" of our Knowledge Tree representing the BIG THREE disciplines that fundamentally contribute to hiqh quality Immersive Learning experiences: (1) Computer Science, (2) UX/Game Design and (3) The Learning Sciences. We are so excited of the possibilities of Sarah's contribution (check out her work on our Affiliate Partner's XR Women's Frame VR space!) and look to similarly build out 12 applied areas in Frames across our campus:

  ANNOUNCEMENT   Prof. Leonel Morgado Steps Down from iLRN Board, Continues Active Role in the Community    The Immersive Learning Research Network (iLRN) announces that Prof. Leonel Morgado has stepped down from his position on the Board of Directors, effective at the conclusion of our recent conference. Prof. Morgado has been a foundational member of iLRN for the past decade and has served on the Board of Directors for five and a half years, contributing significantly to our growth and success.  
  In his former roles as Vice-President and Director for Scientific Quality, Prof. Morgado led the successful inclusion of the annual iLRN conference in the CORE rankings and worked continuously with conference organizers to sustain and improve the scientific quality while maintaining the community and welcoming spirit of our event and organization. His contributions to the Knowledge Tree are enabling immersive learning researchers to employ solid theoretical grounding, replicable methods, and common terminology to further develop the field.  
  While he is stepping down from the board, Prof. Morgado will continue to play an active role within iLRN as a member of the Steering Committee, Circle of Scholars, and Knowledge Tree. He will remain involved helping to enhance the global relevance of our field.  
  "I believe iLRN is poised to become a major reference organization in immersive learning research and practice," said Prof. Morgado. "By stepping down, I hope to open opportunities for other researchers to take on this role and bring new energy and ideas to our community."  
  We are grateful for Prof. Morgado's unwavering dedication and are delighted that he will continue to contribute to iLRN's mission. Please join us in thanking him for his service and in looking forward to his ongoing involvement.  
  iLRN remains strongly committed to Scientific Quality as a key value and pursuit for the iLRN community and with Prof. Morgado’s help are seeking a new Director to join our board to continue innovative and capacity building for the immersive learning sciences.
