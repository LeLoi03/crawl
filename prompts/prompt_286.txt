  About  
 WELCOME TO WCNC 2023  
 The IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC) is one of the premier annual events of IEEE in the wireless research arena bringing together researchers, academics, industry, and government. WCNC 2023 will be held in Glasgow, home of four universities as well as the Scotland 5G Centre, stimulating the deployment of new wireless technologies across urban and rural areas and transforming society, economy and industry. WCNC 2023 will include technical sessions, tutorials, workshops, and technology and business panels. You are invited to submit papers, and proposals for panels, tutorials, and workshops, in all areas of wireless communications, networks, services, and applications.

 15 th  International Workshop on Computational Optimization (WCO'22)  
 Sofia, Bulgaria, 4 - 7 September, 2022  
 Committee   
 Best Paper Award - Past Winners   
 Many real world problems arising in engineering, economics, medicine and other domains can be formulated as optimization tasks. These problems are frequently characterized by non-convex, non-differentiable, discontinuous, noisy or dynamic objective functions and constraints which ask for adequate computational methods.  
 The aim of this workshop is to stimulate the communication between researchers working on different fields of optimization and practitioners who need reliable and efficient computational optimization methods.  
  optimization in statistics, econometrics, finance, physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, and engineering 
  environment modeling and optimization 
  Best Paper Award  
 The best WCO'22 paper will be awarded during the social dinner of FedCSIS 2022.   
 The best paper will be selected by WCO'22 co-Chairs by taking into consideration the scores suggested by the reviewers, as well as the quality of the given oral presentation.   
 Paper submission  
 Authors should submit draft papers (as Postscript, PDF or MSWord file). 
  The total length of a paper should not exceed 10 pages IEEE style (including tables, figures and references). IEEE style templates are available | here | . 
  Papers will be refereed and accepted on the basis of their scientific merit and relevance to the workshop. 
  Preprints containing accepted papers will be published on a USB memory stick provided to the FedCSIS participants. 
  Only | papers presented at the conference will be published in Conference Proceedings and submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore® database. 
  Conference proceedings will be submitted for indexation according to information | here | .

 Recent Advances in Computational Optimization: Results of the Workshop on Computational Optimization WCO 2023  
 ★  ★  ★  ★  ★    
 Our everyday life is unthinkable without optimization. We try to minimize our effort and maximize the achieved profit.  
 Many real-world and industrial problems arising in engineering, economics, medicine, and other domains can be formulated as optimization tasks.  
 The book is a comprehensive collection of extended contributions from the Workshops on Computational Optimization 2023.  
 It shows how to develop algorithms for them based on new intelligent methods like evolutionary computations, ant colony optimization, constrain programming Monte Carlo method, and others. This research demonstrates how some real-world problems arising in engineering, economics, and other domains can be formulated as optimization problems.

 WEBIST 2023 will be held in conjunction with icSPORTS 2023    , CHIRA 2023    , IJCCI 2023    and IC3K 2023    .   
  Registration to WEBIST allows free access to the icSPORTS, CHIRA, IJCCI and IC3K conferences (as a non-speaker).  
  Although the conference is back to the normal mode (i.e., in-person) speakers are allowed to present remotely if unable to travel to the venue (hybrid support).    
 The purpose of the International Conference on Web Information Systems and Technologies (WEBIST) is to bring together researchers, engineers and practitioners interested in the technological advances and business applications of web-based information systems. The conference has four main tracks, covering different aspects of Web Information Systems, namely Internet Technology, Web Intelligence and Semantic Web, Social Network Analytics, HCI in Mobile Systems and Web Interfaces.  
  WEBIST focuses on real world applications; therefore authors should highlight the benefits of Web Information Systems and Technologies for industry and services, in addition to academic applications. Ideas on how to solve business problems using web-based information systems and technologies, will be discussed at the conference.
