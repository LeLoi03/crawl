 Generative AI and the Future of Machine Translation  
  The Generative AI and the Future of Machine Translation ( AMTA 2023  ) took place Online on 08 November, 2023.  
 Generative AI and the Future of Machine Translation will focus on advances in cross-lingual technology and processes that leverage Large Language Models. Moving beyond the explosion of hype that began with the general availability of ChatGPT in November 2022, this event is intended as a forum for a thoughtful exchange of ideas informed by a year of successes and failures in applying Large Language Models to the challenges of cross-lingual communication and data processing.  
  Generative AI and the Future of Machine Translation included a keynote talk, expert panel discussions, presentations, tutorials for both beginners and more experienced practitioners, and demonstrations from technology providers.

Analysis of Algorithms  
 Analysis of Algorithms (AofA) is a field at the boundary of computer science and mathematics. The goal is to obtain a precise understanding of the asymptotic, average-case characteristics of algorithms and data structures. A unifying theme is the use of probabilistic, combinatorial and analytic methods. The objects to be studied include random branching processes, graphs permutations, trees, and strings.

  Abstract    
 Consider a tree T = (V,E) with root ∘ and an edge length function 𝓁:E → ℝ_+. The phylogenetic covariance matrix of T is the matrix C with rows and columns indexed by L, the leaf set of T, with entries C(i,j): = ∑_{e ∈ [i∧ j,o]}𝓁(e), for each i,j ∈ L. Recent work [Gorman & Lladser 2023] has shown that the phylogenetic covariance matrix of a large but random binary tree T is significantly sparsified, with overwhelmingly high probability, under a change-of-basis to the so-called Haar-like wavelets of T. Notably, this finding enables manipulating the spectrum of covariance matrices of large binary trees without the necessity to store them in computer memory but instead performing two post-order traversals of the tree [Gorman & Lladser 2023]. Building on the methods of the aforesaid paper, this manuscript further advances their sparsification result to encompass the broader class of k-regular trees, for any given k ≥ 2. This extension is achieved by refining existing asymptotic formulas for the mean and variance of the internal path length of random k-regular trees, utilizing hypergeometric function properties and identities.

  Abstract    
 The FIND algorithm (also called Quickselect) is a fundamental algorithm to select ranks or quantiles within a set of data. It was shown by Grübel and Rösler that the number of key comparisons required by FIND as a process of the quantiles α ∈ [0,1] in a natural probabilistic model converges after normalization in distribution within the càdlàg space D[0,1] endowed with the Skorokhod metric. We show that the process of the residuals in the latter convergence after normalization converges in distribution to a mixture of Gaussian processes in D[0,1] and identify the limit’s conditional covariance functions. A similar result holds for the related algorithm QuickVal. Our method extends to other cost measures such as the number of swaps (key exchanges) required by FIND or cost measures which are based on key comparisons but take into account that the cost of a comparison between two keys may depend on their values, an example being the number of bit comparisons needed to compare keys given by their bit expansions.

  Abstract    
 The Twelvefold Way represents Rota’s classification, addressing the most fundamental enumeration problems and their associated combinatorial counting formulas. These distinct problems are connected to enumerating functions defined from a set of elements denoted by 𝒩 into another one 𝒦. The counting solutions for the twelve problems are well known. We are interested in unranking algorithms. Such an algorithm is based on an underlying total order on the set of structures we aim at constructing. By taking the rank of an object, i.e. its number according to the total order, the algorithm outputs the structure itself after having built it. One famous total order is the lexicographic order: it is probably the one that is the most used by people when one wants to order things. While the counting solutions for Rota’s classification have been known for years it is interesting to note that three among the problems have yet no lexicographic unranking algorithm. In this paper we aim at providing algorithms for the last three cases that remain without such algorithms. After presenting in detail the solution for set partitions associated with the famous Stirling numbers of the second kind, we explicitly explain how to adapt the algorithm for the two remaining cases. Additionally, we propose a detailed and fine-grained complexity analysis based on the number of bitwise arithmetic operations.

  Abstract    
 It is celebrated that a simple random walk on ℤ and ℤ² returns to the initial vertex v infinitely many times during infinitely many transitions, which is said recurrent, while it returns to v only finite times on ℤ^d for d ≥ 3, which is said transient. It is also known that a simple random walk on a growing region on ℤ^d can be recurrent depending on growing speed for any fixed d. This paper shows that a simple random walk on {0,1,…,N}ⁿ with an increasing n and a fixed N can be recurrent depending on the increasing speed of n. Precisely, we are concerned with a specific model of a random walk on a growing graph (RWoGG) and show a phase transition between the recurrence and transience of the random walk regarding the growth speed of the graph. For the proof, we develop a pausing coupling argument introducing the notion of weakly less homesick as graph growing (weakly LHaGG).

  Abstract    
 In the asymptotic analysis of regular sequences as defined by Allouche and Shallit, it is usually advisable to study their summatory function because the original sequence has a too fluctuating behaviour. It might be that the process of taking the summatory function has to be repeated if the sequence is fluctuating too much. In this paper we show that for all regular sequences except for some degenerate cases, repeating this process finitely many times leads to a "nice" asymptotic expansion containing periodic fluctuations whose Fourier coefficients can be computed using the results on the asymptotics of the summatory function of regular sequences by the first two authors of this paper. In a recent paper, Hwang, Janson, and Tsai perform a thorough investigation of divide-and-conquer recurrences. These can be seen as 2-regular sequences. By considering them as the summatory function of their forward difference, the results on the asymptotics of the summatory function of regular sequences become applicable. We thoroughly investigate the case of a polynomial toll function.

  Abstract    
 In this paper we obtain some new results on the enumeration of parking functions and labeled forests. We introduce new statistics both for parking functions and for labeled forests that are connected to each other by means of a bijection. We determine the joint distribution of two statistics on parking functions and their counterparts on labeled forests. Our results on labeled forests also serve to explain the mysterious equidistribution between two seemingly unrelated statistics in parking functions recently identified by Stanley and Yin and give an explicit bijection between the two statistics.
