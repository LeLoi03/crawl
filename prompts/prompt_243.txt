 Scope of the Conference   
 RTSS’23 welcomes submissions of high-quality, original research papers related to both real-time systems theory and practice. Manuscripts may be submitted to either the real-time systems track ( Track 1  ) or the design and applications track ( Track 2  ), which covers Cyber-Physical Systems, HW-SW integration and system-level design, and Internet of Things (IoT). To be in scope, ALL submissions must address some form of real-time requirements such as deadlines, response times or delay/latency.  RTSS especially welcomes new and emerging topics provided that they address some aspects of real-time requirements as stated above. Such topics may include machine learning techniques for the design and analysis of real-time systems, system design approaches for achieving real-time machine learning, resource management in autonomous systems, system-level solutions for real-time applications exploiting domain-specific accelerators, etc.  
 Track 1: Real-Time Systems Track   
 The objective of this track is to promote cutting-edge research in real-time systems, especially new and emerging topics. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to, the following: operating systems, networks, middleware, compilers, tools, scheduling, QoS support, resource management, testing and debugging, design and verification, modeling, WCET analysis, performance analysis, fault tolerance, security, and system experimentation and deployment experiences.  
 Internet of Things (IoT)  
 Grand challenges in IoT include extremely constrained resources (energy supply, storage and computational power) in IoT devices, unprecedented scalability requirements as well as uncertain dynamics in their operating environments. Submissions that build on solid theoretical foundations, present empirical development, and experimental evaluations for empowering IoT applications with real-time requirements are welcome.  
  Paper Submissions   
 Submitted papers must describe original work not previously published or concurrently submitted elsewhere. Papers based on previous work presented at workshops are eligible for submission – if the workshop paper has a digital object identifier (DOI) then the submission must contain at least 30% new material. All submitted papers must comply with the double-blind submission requirements. The main body of each submitted paper is limited to 11 pages of technical content with additional pages permitted for bibliography only. Submissions must be formatted according to IEEE conference paper guidelines.

23rd International Conference on Runtime Verification  
 3 - 6 October 2023, Thessaloniki, Greece  
 CALL FOR PAPERS    
 Thessaloniki  
 The 23rd International Conference on Runtime Verification (RV'23) will take place in Thessaloniki, Greece, on October 3 - 6, 2023.  
 News  
 📣 RV’23 program is now online  .  
  Social dinner (October 5th) options - Participants fill in the form  .   
 📣 RV’23 Special Issue: A Special Issue on RV’23 has been planned in the International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (STTT)  with extended versions of the best regular papers.   
 📣 RV’23 Keynote talk  : Monitoring of Learning-Enabled Components  , Saddek Bensalem, Universirsité Grenoble Alpes.   
 📣 RV’23 Keynote talk  : Compositional Verification and Run-time Monitoring for Learning-Enabled Autonomous Systems  , Corina Pasareanu, NASA Ames.   
 Objectives and Scope  
 Runtime verification is concerned with the monitoring and analysis of the runtime behaviour of software and hardware systems. Runtime verification techniques are crucial for system correctness, reliability, and robustness; they provide an additional level of rigor and effectiveness compared to conventional testing and are generally more practical than exhaustive formal verification. Runtime verification can be used prior to deployment, for testing verification, and debugging purposes, and after deployment for ensuring reliability, safety, and security and for providing fault containment and recovery as well as online system repair. The topics of the conference include, but are not limited to: specification languages for monitoring 
  Application areas of runtime verification include cyber-physical systems, autonomous systems safety/mission critical systems, enterprise and systems software, cloud systems, reactive control systems, health management and diagnosis systems, and system security and privacy.  
 Please see the Call for Papers  for more details.

  Welcome to SACI 2023!   
 Authors are welcome to submit original and unpublished papers and attend the IEEE 17 th  International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics (SACI 2023)  to be held on May 23-26, 2023  in Timisoara, Romania  .  
  SACI conference appears on the Australian Research Council list, in class C.  
  Since we are still living in pandemic era, the conference is going to be organized in hybrid, ie. everyone is welcome to Timisoara to attend personally, but it is possible to present the paper online via Zoom for those who can not arrange the travel. Anyway, all papers must be presented either onsite or online. Participants have the possibility to decide the presentation method during online registration.   
 Call for Papers    
 The conference appears on the IEEE Conference Search  .  
  Conference proceedings that meet IEEE quality review standards may be eligible for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from IEEE Xplore), if the paper is not presented at the conference. 'Pay to publish' is not allowed by IEEE. So at least one author of a paper must show up and present the paper at the conference.  
  The conference proceedings is now available via IEEE Xplore  .
