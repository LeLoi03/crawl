   Tailoring Domain Adaptation for Machine Translation Quality Estimation    
  Javad Pourmostafa Roshan Sharami  | Dimitar Shterionov  | Frédéric Blain  | Eva Vanmassenhove  | Mirella De Sisto  | Chris Emmery  | Pieter Spronck    
 While quality estimation (QE) can play an important role in the translation process, its effectiveness relies on the availability and quality of training data. For QE in particular, high-quality labeled data is often lacking due to the high-cost and effort associated with labeling such data. Aside from the data scarcity challenge, QE models should also be generalizabile, i.e., they should be able to handle data from different domains, both generic and specific. To alleviate these two main issues — data scarcity and domain mismatch — this paper combines domain adaptation and data augmentation within a robust QE system. Our method is to first train a generic QE model and then fine-tune it on a specific domain while retaining generic knowledge. Our results show a significant improvement for all the language pairs investigated, better cross-lingual inference, and a superior performance in zero-shot learning scenarios as compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

   BLEU  Meets COMET  : Combining Lexical and Neural Metrics Towards Robust Machine Translation Evaluation    
  Taisiya Glushkova  | Chrysoula Zerva  | André F. T. Martins    
 Although neural-based machine translation evaluation metrics, such as COMET or BLEURT, have achieved strong correlations with human judgements, they are sometimes unreliable in detecting certain phenomena that can be considered as critical errors, such as deviations in entities and numbers. In contrast, traditional evaluation metrics such as BLEU or chrF, which measure lexical or character overlap between translation hypotheses and human references, have lower correlations with human judgements but are sensitive to such deviations. In this paper, we investigate several ways of combining the two approaches in order to increase robustness of state-of-the-art evaluation methods to translations with critical errors. We show that by using additional information during training, such as sentence-level features and word-level tags, the trained metrics improve their capability to penalize translations with specific troublesome phenomena, which leads to gains in correlations with humans and on the recent DEMETR benchmark on several language pairs.

   An Empirical Study of Leveraging Knowledge Distillation for Compressing Multilingual Neural Machine Translation Models    
  Varun Gumma  | Raj Dabre  | Pratyush Kumar    
 Knowledge distillation (KD) is a well-known method for compressing neural models. However, works focusing on distilling knowledge from large multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) models into smaller ones are practically nonexistent, despite the popularity and superiority of MNMT. This paper bridges this gap by presenting an empirical investigation of knowledge distillation for compressing MNMT models. We take Indic to English translation as a case study and demonstrate that commonly used language-agnostic and language-aware KD approaches yield models that are 4-5x smaller but also suffer from performance drops of up to 3.5 BLEU. To mitigate this, we then experiment with design considerations such as shallower versus deeper models, heavy parameter sharing, multistage training, and adapters. We observe that deeper compact models tend to be as good as shallower non-compact ones and that fine-tuning a distilled model on a high-quality subset slightly boosts translation quality. Overall, we conclude that compressing MNMT models via KD is challenging, indicating immense scope for further research.

   Empirical Assessment of k NN  - MT  for Real-World Translation Scenarios    
  Pedro Henrique Martins  | João Alves  | Tânia Vaz  | Madalena Gonçalves  | Beatriz Silva  | Marianna Buchicchio  | José G. C. de Souza  | André F. T. Martins    
 This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of the k-Nearest Neighbor Machine Translation model (kNN-MT) in real-world scenarios. kNN-MT is a retrieval-augmented framework that combines the advantages of parametric models with non-parametric datastores built using a set of parallel sentences. Previous studies have primarily focused on evaluating the model using only the BLEU metric and have not tested kNN-MT in real world scenarios. Our study aims to fill this gap by conducting a comprehensive analysis on various datasets comprising different language pairs and different domains, using multiple automatic metrics and expert evaluated Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM). We compare kNN-MT with two alternate strategies: fine-tuning all the model parameters and adapter-based finetuning. Finally, we analyze the effect of the datastore size on translation quality, and we examine the number of entries necessary to bootstrap and configure the index.

   What Works When in Context-aware Neural Machine Translation?    
  Harritxu Gete  | Thierry Etchegoyhen  | Gorka Labaka    
 Document-level Machine Translation has emerged as a promising means to enhance automated translation quality, but it is currently unclear how effectively context-aware models use the available context during translation. This paper aims to provide insight into the current state of models based on input concatenation, with an in-depth evaluation on English–German and English–French standard datasets. We notably evaluate the impact of data bias, antecedent part-of-speech, context complexity, and the syntactic function of the elements involved in discursive phenomena. Our experimental results indicate that the selected models do improve the overall translation in context, with varying sensitivity to the different factors we examined. We notably show that the selected context-aware models operate markedly better on regular syntactic configurations involving subject antecedents and pronouns, with degraded performance as the configurations become more dissimilar.

   Gender-Fair Post-Editing: A Case Study Beyond the Binary    
  Manuel Lardelli  | Dagmar Gromann    
 Machine Translation (MT) models are well-known to suffer from gender bias, especially for gender beyond a binary conception. Due to the multiplicity of language-specific strategies for gender representation beyond the binary, debiasing MT is extremely challenging. As an alternative, we propose a case study on gender-fair post-editing. In this study, six professional translators each post-edited three English to German machine translations. For each translation, participants were instructed to use a different gender-fair language strategy, that is, gender-neutral rewording, gender-inclusive characters, and a neosystem. The focus of this study is not on translation quality but rather on the ease of integrating gender-fair language into the post-editing process. Findings from non-participant observation and interviews show clear differences in temporal and cognitive effort between participants and strategy as well as in the success of using gender-fair language.

   A social media NMT  engine for a low-resource language combination    
  María Do Campo Bayón  | Pilar Sánchez-Gijón    
 The aim of this article is to present a new Neural Machine Translation (NMT) from Spanish into Galician for the social media domain that was trained with a Twitter corpus. Our main goal is to outline the methods used to build the corpus and the steps taken to train the engine in a low-resource language context. We have evalu-ated the engine performance both with regular automatic metrics and with a new methodology based on the non-inferiority process and contrasted this information with an error classification human evalua-tion conducted by professional linguists. We will present the steps carried out fol-lowing the conclusions of a previous pilot study, describe the new process followed, analyze the new engine and present the final conclusions.

   Analysing Mistranslation of Emotions in Multilingual Tweets by Online MT  Tools    
  Hadeel Saadany  | Constantin Orasan  | Rocio Caro Quintana  | Felix Do Carmo  | Leonardo Zilio    
 It is common for websites that contain User-Generated Text (UGT) to provide an automatic translation option to reach out to their linguistically diverse users. In such scenarios, the process of translating the users’ emotions is entirely automatic with no human intervention, neither for post-editing, nor for accuracy checking. In this paper, we assess whether automatic translation tools can be a successful real-life utility in transferring emotion in multilingual tweets. Our analysis shows that the mistranslation of the source tweet can lead to critical errors where the emotion is either completely lost or flipped to an opposite sentiment. We identify linguistic phenomena specific to Twitter data which pose a challenge in translation of emotions and show how frequent these features are in different language pairs. We also show that commonly-used quality metrics can lend false confidence in the performance of online MT tools specifically when the source emotion is distorted in telegraphic messages such as tweets.

   D  ata L  it MT  – Teaching Data Literacy in the Context of Machine Translation Literacy    
  Janiça Hackenbuchner  | Ralph Krüger    
 This paper presents the DataLitMT project conducted at TH Koln – University of Applied Sciences. The project develops learning resources for teaching data literacy in its translation-specific form of professional machine translation (MT) literacy to students of translation and specialised communication programmes at BA and MA levels. We discuss the need for data literacy teaching in a translation/specialised communication context, present the three theoretical pillars of the project (consisting of a Professional MT Literacy Framework, an MT-specific data literacy framework and a competence matrix derived from these frameworks) and give an overview of the learning resources developed as part of the project.

   Do Humans Translate like Machines? Students’ Conceptualisations of Human and Machine Translation    
  Salmi Leena  | Aletta G. Dorst  | Maarit Koponen  | Katinka Zeven    
 This paper explores how students conceptualise the processes involved in human and machine translation, and how they describe the similarities and differences between them. The paper presents the results of a survey involving university students (B.A. and M.A.) taking a course on translation who filled out an online questionnaire distributed in Finnish, Dutch and English. Our study finds that students often describe both human translation and machine translation in similar terms, suggesting they do not sufficiently distinguish between them and do not fully understand how machine translation works. The current study suggests that training in Machine Translation Literacy may need to focus more on the conceptualisations involved and how conceptual and vernacular misconceptions may affect how translators understand human and machine translation.

   Adapting Machine Translation Education to the Neural Era: A Case Study of MT  Quality Assessment    
  Lieve Macken  | Bram Vanroy  | Arda Tezcan    
 The use of automatic evaluation metrics to assess Machine Translation (MT) quality is well established in the translation industry. Whereas it is relatively easy to cover the word- and character-based metrics in an MT course, it is less obvious to integrate the newer neural metrics. In this paper we discuss how we introduced the topic of MT quality assessment in a course for translation students. We selected three English source texts, each having a different difficulty level and style, and let the students translate the texts into their L1 and reflect upon translation difficulty. Afterwards, the students were asked to assess MT quality for the same texts using different methods and to critically reflect upon obtained results. The students had access to the MATEO web interface, which contains word- and character-based metrics as well as neural metrics. The students used two different reference translations: their own translations and professional translations of the three texts. We not only synthesise the comments of the students, but also present the results of some cross-lingual analyses on nine different language pairs.

   PE  effort and neural-based automatic MT  metrics: do they correlate?    
  Sergi Alvarez  | Antoni Oliver    
 Neural machine translation (NMT) has shown overwhelmingly good results in recent times. This improvement in quality has boosted the presence of NMT in nearly all fields of translation. Most current translation industry workflows include postediting (PE) of MT as part of their process. For many domains and language combinations, translators post-edit raw machine translation (MT) to produce the final document. However, this process can only work properly if the quality of the raw MT output can be assured. MT is usually evaluated using automatic scores, as they are much faster and cheaper. However, traditional automatic scores have not been good quality indicators and do not correlate with PE effort. We analyze the correlation of each of the three dimensions of PE effort (temporal, technical and cognitive) with COMET, a neural framework which has obtained outstanding results in recent MT evaluation campaigns.

   Do online Machine Translation Systems Care for Context? What About a GPT  Model?    
  Sheila Castilho  | Clodagh Quinn Mallon  | Rahel Meister  | Shengya Yue    
 This paper addresses the challenges of evaluating document-level machine translation (MT) in the context of recent advances in context-aware neural machine translation (NMT). It investigates how well online MT systems deal with six context-related issues, namely lexical ambiguity, grammatical gender, grammatical number, reference, ellipsis, and terminology, when a larger context span containing the solution for those issues is given as input. Results are compared to the translation outputs from the online ChatGPT. Our results show that, while the change of punctuation in the input yields great variability in the output translations, the context position does not seem to have a great impact. Moreover, the GPT model seems to outperform the NMT systems but performs poorly for Irish. The study aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of online MT systems in handling context and highlight the importance of considering contextual factors in evaluating MT systems.

   Incorporating Human Translator Style into E  nglish- T  urkish Literary Machine Translation    
  Zeynep Yirmibeşoğlu  | Olgun Dursun  | Harun Dalli  | Mehmet Şahin  | Ena Hodzik  | Sabri Gürses  | Tunga Güngör    
 Although machine translation systems are mostly designed to serve in the general domain, there is a growing tendency to adapt these systems to other domains like literary translation. In this paper, we focus on English-Turkish literary translation and develop machine translation models that take into account the stylistic features of translators. We fine-tune a pre-trained machine translation model by the manually-aligned works of a particular translator. We make a detailed analysis of the effects of manual and automatic alignments, data augmentation methods, and corpus size on the translations. We propose an approach based on stylistic features to evaluate the style of a translator in the output translations. We show that the human translator style can be highly recreated in the target machine translations by adapting the models to the style of the translator.

   Machine translation of anonymized documents with human-in-the-loop    
  Konstantinos Chatzitheodorou  | M. Ángeles García Escrivá  | Carmen Grau Lacal    
 In this paper, we introduce a workflow that utilizes human-in-the-loop for post-editing anonymized texts, with the aim of reconciling the competing needs of data privacy and data quality. By combining the strengths of machine translation and human post-editing, our methodology facilitates the efficient and effective translation of anonymized texts, while ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive information. Our experimental results validate that this approach is capable of providing all necessary information to the translators for producing high-quality translations effectively. Overall, our workflow offers a promising solution for organizations seeking to achieve both data privacy and data quality in their translation processes.

   Using MT  for multilingual covid-19 case load prediction from social media texts    
  Maja Popovic  | Vasudevan Nedumpozhimana  | Meegan Gower  | Sneha Rautmare  | Nishtha Jain  | John Kelleher    
 In the context of an epidemiological study involving multilingual social media, this paper reports on the ability of machine translation systems to preserve content relevant for a document classification task designed to determine whether the social media text is related to covid. The results indicate that machine translation does provide a feasible basis for scaling epidemiological social media surveillance to multiple languages. Moreover, a qualitative error analysis revealed that the majority of classification errors are not caused by MT errors.

   Analyzing the Potential of Linguistic Features for Sign Spotting: A Look at Approximative Features    
  Natalie Hollain  | Martha Larson  | Floris Roelofsen    
 Sign language processing is the field of research that aims to recognize, retrieve, and spot signs in videos. Various approaches have been developed, varying in whether they use linguistic features and whether they use landmark detection tools or not. Incorporating linguistics holds promise for improving sign language processing in terms of performance, generalizability, and explainability. This paper focuses on the task of sign spotting and aims to expand on the approximative linguistic features that have been used in previous work, and to understand when linguistic features deliver an improvement over landmark features. We detect landmarks with Mediapipe and extract linguistically relevant features from them, including handshape, orientation, location, and movement. We compare a sign spotting model using linguistic features with a model operating on landmarks directly, finding that the approximate linguistic features tested in this paper capture some aspects of signs better than the landmark features, while they are worse for others.

   Gender-Fair Language in Translation: A Case Study    
  Angela Balducci Paolucci  | Manuel Lardelli  | Dagmar Gromann    
 With an increasing visibility of non-binary individuals, a growing number of language-specific strategies to linguistically include all genders or neutralize any gender references can be observed. Due to this multiplicity of proposed strategies and gender-specific grammatical differences across languages, selecting the one option to translate gender-fair language is challenging for machines and humans alike. As a first step towards gender-fair translation, we conducted a survey with translators to compare four gender-fair translations from a notional gender language, English, to a grammatical gender language, German. Proposed translations were rated by means of best-worst scaling as well as regarding their readability and comprehensibility. Participants expressed a clear preference for strategies with gender-inclusive character, i.e., colon.

   Gender-inclusive translation for a gender-inclusive sport: strategies and translator perceptions at the International Quadball Association    
  Joke Daems    
 Gender-inclusive language is of key importance to the IQA, the international governing body for quadball, a mixed-gender contact sport that explicitly welcomes players of all genders. While relatively straightforward for English, the picture becomes more complicated for most of the other IQA working languages. This paper provides an overview of the strategies currently chosen by translation team leaders for different IQA languages, the factors that influenced this decision and their connection with existing research on inclusive language strategies. It further explores the awareness and attitudes of IQA translators towards those strategies and factors.

   Gender, names and other mysteries: Towards the ambiguous for gender-inclusive translation    
  Danielle Saunders  | Katrina Olsen    
 The vast majority of work on gender in MT focuses on ‘unambiguous’ inputs, where gender markers in the source language are expected to be resolved in the output. Conversely, this paper explores the widespread case where the source sentence lacks explicit gender markers, but the target sentence contains them due to richer grammatical gender. We particularly focus on inputs containing person names. Investigating such sentence pairs casts a new light on research into MT gender bias and its mitigation. We find that many name-gender co-occurrences in MT data are not resolvable with ‘unambiguous gender’ in the source language, and that gender-ambiguous examples can make up a large proportion of training examples. From this, we discuss potential steps toward gender-inclusive translation which accepts the ambiguity in both gender and translation.

 Sammendrag  
 The use of social robots in public spaces is becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to provide personalized services to users. However, the convergence of different technologies and software applications has raised concerns regarding security requirements, standards, and regulations. Specifically, there are significant concerns about the evolving threat landscape for software applications in public settings, where social robots interact without supervision and are in direct contact with threat actors. During the development of social robots software, developers and practitioners need practical tools to continuously assess their products’ security profiles. This paper presents a preventive approach to the dynamic evolving security landscape of Social Robots in Public Spaces (SRPS) using design science research (DSR) methodology to develop a security framework. The study investigates security threats, vulnerabilities, and risks associated with SRPS software development and analyzes existing related frameworks to design a security framework for SRPS software developers. The research aims to provide insights into the security aspects of SRPS software application development processes and contribute to developing effective security frameworks to mitigate evolving risks and ensure secure operation and acceptance in public spaces.
