 Publication date:  accepted papers will be published open access for one month on the ACM Digital Library up to two weeks prior to the conference opening date (exact date TBA)  
 Full paper authors are required to submit an abstract by midnight January 24, 2023 AoE. Paper submission (deadline: midnight January 31, 2023 AoE) is not possible without a submitted abstract. We recommend authors waiting for notification from the other conferences to submit an abstract, even if they do not ultimately submit a paper. Immediately after the abstract deadline, PC Chairs will desk reject submissions that lack informative titles and abstracts (“placeholder abstracts”).  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 Submission Guidelines  
 See this brief checklist to strengthen an IR paper   , for authors and reviewers.  
 Full research papers must describe original work that has not been previously published, not accepted for publication elsewhere, and not simultaneously submitted or currently under review in another journal or conference (including the other tracks of SIGIR 2023).  
 Submissions of full research papers must be in English, in PDF format, and be at most 9 pages (including figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any content except references) in length, with unrestricted space for references, in the current ACM two-column conference format. Suitable LaTeX, Word, and Overleaf   templates are available from the ACM Website   (use “sigconf” proceedings template for LaTeX and the Interim Template for Word). ACM’s CCS concepts and keywords are not required for review but may be required if accepted and published by the ACM.  
 For LaTeX, the following should be used:  
 documentclass[sigconf,natbib=true,anonymous=true]{acmart}  Submissions must be anonymous and should be submitted electronically via EasyChair:  
  At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for, and present the work at the conference.  
 Anonymity  
 The full paper review process is double-blind. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submission must not include author information and must not include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent. However, it is acceptable to refer to companies or organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments or deployed solutions if there is no implication that the authors are currently affiliated with these organizations. While authors can upload to institutional or other preprint repositories such as arXiv.org before reviewing is complete, we generally discourage this since it places anonymity at risk. If the paper is already on arXiv, please change the title and abstract so that it is not immediately obvious they are the same. Do not upload the paper to a preprint site after submission to SIGIR—wait until a review decision to avoid reviewers seeing the paper in daily digests or other places. Breaking anonymity puts the submission at risk of being desk rejected.  
 Authors should carefully go through ACM’s authorship policy   before submitting a paper. Please ensure that all authors are clearly identified in EasyChair before the submission deadline. To support the identification of reviewers with conflicts of interest, the full author list must be specified at submission time. No changes to authorship   will be permitted for the camera-ready submission under any circumstance or after submissions close. So please, make sure you have them listed correctly when submissions close.  
 Desk Rejection Policy  
 Submissions that violate the preprint policy, anonymity, length, or formatting requirements, or are determined to violate ACM’s policies on academic dishonesty   , including plagiarism, author misrepresentation, falsification, etc., are subject to desk rejection by the chairs. Any of the following may result in desk rejection:  
 Figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgements, or any other content after page 9 of the submission. 
  Formatting not in line with the guidelines provided above. 
  Authors or authors’ institutional affiliations clearly named or easily discoverable. 
  Links to source code repositories that reveal author identities, or extended versions of the current paper. It is recommended to hold these for the final published version and | submit source code for artifact review | . 
  Addition of authors after abstract submission. 
  Content that has been determined to have been copied from other sources. 
  Any form of academic fraud or dishonesty. 
  Lack of topical fit for SIGIR. 
 Relevant Topics  
 Filtering and recommendation (e.g., content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, recommender systems, recommendation algorithms, zero-query and implicit search, personalized recommendation). 
  Document representation and content analysis for search or recommendation (e.g., cross-lingual and multilingual search, NLP: summarization, text representation, linguistic analysis, readability, opinion mining and sentiment analysis, clustering, classification, topic models for search and recommendation). 
  Knowledge acquisition (e.g. information extraction, relation extraction, event extraction, query understanding, human-in-the-loop knowledge acquisition). 
  Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing for Search and Recommendation.  Research bridging ML, NLP, and IR.  
 Core ML (e.g. deep learning for IR, embeddings, intelligent personal assistants and agents, unbiased learning).

 Call for Papers  
 Overview  
 The 2023 ACM SIGMETRICS conference will be held in Orlando, Florida, USA, on June 19-22, 2023.  
 We solicit papers on the development and application of state-of-the-art, broadly applicable analytic, simulation and measurement-based performance evaluation techniques. The conference provides a high-quality forum for presenting results and discussing ideas that further our knowledge and understanding of the measurement, modeling, analysis, and design of computing systems and networks. Of particular interest is work that presents new performance evaluation methods, or that creatively applies previously developed methods to make predictions about, or gain insights into key design trade-offs in a variety of computing, networked, and cyber-physical systems, ranging from mobile devices and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications to large-scale cloud computing systems and the smart grid. The conference presents papers that have been accepted to appear in the Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems (POMACS). There are multiple deadlines to submit your work in time for a presentation at the conference (see below). A panel of reviewers will consider all accepted and eligible papers, for the Best Paper Award and the Kenneth C. Sevcik Outstanding Student Paper Award. Additionally, a selection of the accepted papers, as identified by a panel of reviewers, may be nominated for publication as Research Highlights in the Communications of the ACM (CACM).  
 A note on the ongoing COVID-19 situation  
 The SIGMETRICS 2023 conference organizers are monitoring the COVID-19 situation from local authorities and the World Health Organization. The conference is several months away, and we hope that the event will be held as planned. It is expected that authors will be required to present their papers in person. Only in the case of major outbreaks near the conference dates alternative solutions will be considered. Regardless of the mode of presentation, all accepted papers will be published in the Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems (POMACS).  
 Topics  
 We solicit papers describing original and previously unpublished research. Specific topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following.  
  Big data, machine learning, AI, data mining, graph analysis, optimization 
  Important Dates  
 There are three submission opportunities over the course of the year.

 Submission Instructions  
 Papers must be submitted electronically in printable pdf form via the submission site posted on this page. All submissions should satisfy the following requirements:  
 Soft tracking | : Since last year, SIGMETRICS uses “soft” tracking to better match reviewers with submitted papers and to more clearly define the scope of submissions. All submissions, regardless of the selected track, will be treated equally in terms of acceptance criteria and review guidelines. Authors must select a track from among the four listed on the submission website when submitting their paper. Optionally, a second track may be selected only for papers with a strong inter-disciplinary element. For authors who have difficulty selecting a track, the PC chairs will be available to provide advice. The four tracks adopted for SIGMETRICS 2023 (for all three deadlines) are: | Learning. | Papers in this track make progress on either (i) the design and analysis of machine learning and AI algorithms, broadly defined, or (ii) the application of tools from machine learning and AI, broadly defined, to the design, control, and optimization of computing, networked, social, or cyber-physical systems. The areas of interest include, but are not limited to, learning theory, online learning, reinforcement learning, deep learning, trustworthy learning (causality, fairness, privacy), distributed learning, as well as their applications to systems. 
  Measurement & Applied Modeling. | Papers in this track make an empirical or applied contribution. They often either (i) draw significant insights from real or synthetic data through access to new data sources or experiments, or through novel analysis of existing data sources; and/or (ii) propose and apply a new model or simulation tool to capture real-world phenomena. Papers in this track may present general-purpose measurement or simulation methodologies, or may focus on a specific application domain, or a particular technology, and explain data obtained from measurements of that domain or technology. 
  Systems. | Papers in this track make a contribution to the design, implementation, and/or practical evaluation of computing, networked, social, or cyber-physical systems. The areas of interest include, but are not limited to networking, distributed systems, computer architecture, wireless networks, edge/IoT applications, high performance computing, cloud computing, energy efficiency, real-time and fault-tolerant computing, security and privacy, social networks, and cyber-physical systems, including the smart grid. System papers with a strong machine learning and AI focus are encouraged to apply to the Learning track. 
  Theory. | Papers in this track make progress on existing theoretical problems, propose new ones, or introduce significant new analysis techniques. The areas of interest include, but are not limited to, stochastic processes & applied probability, graph theory, scheduling & resource allocation, queueing theory, caching theory, algorithms, mathematical optimization, control theory, market design & game theory, privacy & security, network science, and algorithmic fairness. 
  Up to 20 pages, in single-column | acmsmall template format | (with the default 10pt font size), for technical content (including all tables and figures), plus unlimited pages for references. No changes to margins, spacing, or font sizes are allowed from those specified by the style files. Papers violating the formatting guidelines will be returned without review. Additionally, authors may supplement their paper with an appendix, whose length is not constrained. However it may only be used for the purpose of justifying the technical correctness of their claims stated in the body of the paper, e.g., a subset of the proofs or additional experimental validation. Note that the novelty of the submission will be judged based on the technical content of the paper and the reviewers are not obliged to read the appendix. 
  Reviewing is double-blind; please do NOT include your name or affiliation on the submission. Please refer to the anonymity guidelines below in the Policies section. 
  Authors must truthfully declare on the submission page all conflicts with program committee members. If a paper is found to have undeclared conflicts or has listed false conflicts, the paper may be rejected. Conflicts include shared institutional affiliations, collaborations (joint research, authorship, or funding) occurred in the last 24 months before the selected submission deadline or expected in the near future, past or current PhD student/supervisor relationships, close personal or family relationships. 
  Authors are encouraged to conform to the inclusivity guidelines provided in the Diversity and Inclusiveness section below. 
  The Reviewing Process  
 Papers invited to present at the SIGMETRICS conference are journal papers accepted to the Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems (POMACS). The reviewing process for submissions is a hybrid of the traditional conference and journal models in computer science. There are three possible outcomes from the first round of submission:  
 Accept with Shepherding: | Every accepted paper will be shepherded in order to ensure that important suggestions from the reviewers are incorporated into the final version of the paper. This is similar to the “Minor Revision” outcome at a journal. 
  One-shot Revision: | This is similar to the “Major Revision” outcome in a journal. In such cases, the authors will receive a list of issues that are required to be addressed before the paper can be accepted. Authors may then submit a revision of the paper during one of the next two submission deadlines (possibly ACM SIGMETRICS 2024 deadlines). The revision should include an author response to the issues raised by the reviewers as part of the appendix of the paper. If the paper is not submitted within this time then any resubmission will be treated as a new paper. The outcome after resubmission of a “one-shot revision” will either be “Accept with Shepherding” or “Reject”. The one-shot revision may be rejected, for example, if the reviewers find that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed in the revision. If the revision is accepted as a poster or rejected then any future revision of it may not be resubmitted to any SIGMETRICS deadline within 12 months following the initial submission of the paper. 
  Reject: | If the paper is rejected it may not be resubmitted to any SIGMETRICS deadline within 12 months following the initial submission of the paper. 
  Policies  
 Anonymity guidelines: | ACM SIGMETRICS is double-blind, meaning that authors should make a good faith effort to anonymize papers. As an author, you should not identify yourself in the paper either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). However, only non-destructive anonymization is required. For example, system names may be left un-anonymized, if the system name is important for a reviewer to be able to evaluate the work. Specifically, please take the following steps when preparing your submission: 
  Remove authors' names and affiliations from the title page. 
  Remove acknowledgment of identifying names and funding sources. 
  Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments. 
  Use care in referring to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, a good solution is to reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. 
  If you need to reference another submission at ACM SIGMETRICS 2023 on a related topic, reference it as follows: "A related paper describes the design and implementation of our compiler [Anonymous 2023]." with the corresponding citation: "[Anonymous 2023] Under submission. Details omitted for double-blind reviewing." 
  If you cite anonymous work, you should also send the deanonymized reference(s) to the PC chairs in a separate email. 
  Publication of a pre-submission version of the submission on your personal website, institutional archive, or the arXiv is allowed. We encourage the authors to do so as far away as possible from the submission deadline, as potential reviewers may be automatically notified (e.g., if subscribed to receive updates on recently posted papers). In addition, authors should take care not to widely broadcast information about their arXiv submission, for example, on social media forums or a general press release or large mailing lists where PC members in the recipient list or audience can easily identify the authors. 
  PC members and other reviewers are expected to not actively attempt to deanonymize papers. In either case, if there is a breach of double-blind reviewing the author and the reviewer should report it to the PC chairs. 
  For accepted papers, it is expected that the list of authors will not change between the last submission and the final camera-ready copy. However, papers undergoing a one-shot revision are allowed to add authors between the submissions. 
  The paper must have a | substantive title and abstract | . Placeholders are not allowed after the registration deadline. Any submission that does not have a substantive title and abstract by the registration deadline will be rejected without further notice. 
  Submissions must present | original research | . However, previous publication of preliminary work as an extended abstract at a workshop is acceptable as long as the submission includes substantial new material. Further, in such cases, authors should (i) acknowledge their own previous workshop publications with an anonymous citation, and (ii) explain the differences between the SIGMETRICS submission and the prior workshop paper. A rule of thumb is that a prior workshop publication should be at most 6 pages long, not including references. 
  It is ACM policy not to allow | simultaneous submissions | , where the same paper is concurrently submitted to more than one conference/journal. Any simultaneous submissions detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals involved, and the authors may be blacklisted if multiple such violations are detected, including across conference editions. It is considered a simultaneous submission for a paper that is being considered for a one-shot revision to be submitted to another conference/journal before being withdrawn from the SIGMETRICS process. This applies to all papers, i.e., even authors who wish to opt out of POMACS can only submit to a journal after they have received a decision from SIGMETRICS. 
  All accepted papers will undergo a shepherding process. The camera-ready paper must be approved by the shepherd for final publication prior to any upload to the ACM camera-ready management system. No unauthorized changes to the body of the paper or references are allowed in between shepherd approval and camera-ready upload. Violations will be investigated by the conference leadership and may lead to sanctions. 
  Authors have the option to “opt out” of publication in the ACM POMACS journal if they would like to publish their work in some other journal. Authors who choose this option must still present their work at the conference and undergo shepherding in the same terms as papers that will appear in ACM POMACS. Additionally, a 1-2 page extended abstract of the work must be included in Performance Evaluation Review. This abstract is required to contain a link to an online version of the full paper that will be maintained for at least 2 years. 
  For papers that decide to “opt out”, an expedited review process of accepted papers will be provided by the following journals: | ACM Transactions on Modeling and Performance Evaluation of Computer Systems | (ToMPECS) and | Stochastic Systems | . In each case, after you have notified the TPC Chairs of your decision, you should prepare your manuscript using the same preparation guidelines as standard papers for the journals but also notify the Editor-in-Chief and submit the paper with an authors response to the SIGMETRICS reviews. 
  Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered. All submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication. Rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential. 
  To avoid any potential bias, the core conference organizers, including the General Chairs and Program Chairs, will not submit papers to any of the SIGMETRICS 2023 submission deadlines. PC members and other Organizing Committee members, however, are allowed to submit their papers. 
  Ethical Considerations  
 Papers describing experiments with users or user data (e.g., network traffic, passwords, social network information), should follow the basic principles of ethical research, e.g., beneficence (maximizing the benefits to an individual or to society while minimizing harm to the individual), minimal risk (appropriateness of the risk versus benefit ratio), voluntary consent, respect for privacy, and limited deception. When appropriate, authors are encouraged to include a subsection describing these issues. Authors may want to consult the Menlo Report  for further information on ethical principles, or the Allman/Paxson IMC '07 paper  for guidance on ethical data sharing.  
 Authors must, as part of the submission process, attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of their home institution(s), including but not limited to privacy policies and policies on experiments involving humans. Note that submitting research for approval by one's institution's ethics review body is necessary, but not sufficient—in cases where the PC has concerns about the ethics of the work in a submission, the PC will have its own discussion of the ethics of that work. The PC’s review process may examine the ethical soundness of the paper just as it examines the technical soundness.  
 As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . In particular, authors must follow the basic research and publication principle outlined by the ACM Publication Board's Policies and Procedures  and the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct  . Relevant policies regarding the publication and review processes include ACM's policies (i) on the roles and responsibilities in ACM publishing  , (ii) on the coercion and abuse in the ACM publications process  , and on plagiarism, misrepresentation, and falsification  .  
 Diversity and Inclusiveness  
 As part of our efforts at fostering diversity and inclusiveness, we provide the following guidelines to assist you when preparing your paper submission and/or your conference presentation.  
 Inclusivity Guidelines:  Good technical writing often requires pedagogical examples to explain complex ideas. These provide an opportunity to promote inclusiveness by challenging implicit biases and assumptions. Avoid gender-specific pronouns if possible. Where required, consider interspersing a balance of male ("he", "his"), female (“she”, “her”), and gender-neutral (“they”, “their”) ones. 
  Use gender-neutral names in examples. Instead of Alice and Bob, try Alex and Jun. Consider names that reflect a variety of cultural backgrounds: Esteban, Naveena, Sasha, Sergey, Tuan, Xin, and so on. 
  Refrain from assuming binary gender. For instance, the “gender” column in a table of data should have more than just “male” and “female” values. 
  Be mindful of people's diverse backgrounds. Not everyone has two parents. Not every marriage involves "husband" and "wife". Not everyone lives in a house, or has a car. 
  Accessibility Guidelines:  Color and hearing perception varies from person to person depending on age, color blindness, distance, visual acuity, etc. Make sure that the contents of your paper are accessible to all, by considering the following: Use patterns, symbols, and textures to emphasize and contrast visual elements in graphs and figures, rather than using colors alone. Graphs should be readable either in monochrome or colour versions. 
  Use a color palette that is designed for visually-impaired or color-blind people. Avoid poor color combinations such as green/red or blue/purple.
