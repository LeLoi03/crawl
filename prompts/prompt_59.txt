 Memory: The DaMoN Demon    
 Frank Hady, Intel Fellow, Intel’s Office of the CTO Systems Architecture and Engineering Group   
 Memory technology limitations bedevil current computing systems and data management does not escape. As silicon scaling delivers ever faster compute, memory falls further behind exposing capacity, bandwidth, and power deficiencies in our systems. Seeing these issues, computer architects propose memory hierarchy changes only to find most applications shrink-wrapped to the current hierarchy and unable to change. Data management applications provide an innovation bright-spot with researchers and developers ready to co-optimize from application-to-hardware to deliver improved performance. Hierarchy improvements often matter here first. Sitting squarely at this confluence, DaMoN serves to engender such co-optimizations. With this in mind, we set a memory technology baseline using memory silicon trends and constraints. Additionally, we set a memory system baseline summarizing current system memory architectures and issues. Next, we look at the undeniable influence AI is exerting on the hierarchy. Taking memory technology, systems, and applications together, we speculate on memory hierarchy changes to expect – potentially creating opportunities for future data management applications. One such change is already visible in CXL-enabled memory hierarchies envisioned to deliver higher capacity and perhaps more. Finally, we speculate further on system optimizations around memory that are the subject of current research, like memory sharing and near memory computing.

  KeRRaS: Sort-Based Database Query Processing on Wide Tables Using FPGAs    
 Sorting is an important operation in database query processing. Complex pipeline-breaking operators (e.g., aggregation and equi-join) become single-pass algorithms on sorted tables. Therefore, sort-based query processing is a popular method for FPGA-based database system acceleration. However, most accelerators have a limit on the table width or the number of columns they can sort. This limit is often set by the width of the data path or the amount of BRAM present on the FPGA. This paper proposes KeRRaS, an abstract sorting algorithm that enables existing sort-based query processors to support arbitrarily wide tables while offering scalability, preserving modularity, and having low resource overhead. Moreover, the researchers present an implementation of KeRRaS based on morphing sort-merge, a resource-efficient FPGA-based query accelerator. The implementation behaves similarly to morphing sort-merge on narrow tables, and scales well as the number of key columns increases.  
 Elastic Use of Far Memory for In-Memory Database Management Systems    
 The separation and independent scalability of compute and memory is one of the crucial aspects for modern in-memory database systems (IMDBMSs) in the cloud. The new, cache-coherent memory interconnect Compute Express Link (CXL) promises elastic memory capacity through memory pooling. This work adapts the well-known IMDBMS, SAP HANA, for memory pools by features of table data placement and operational heap memory allocation on far memory, and studies the impact of the limited bandwidth and higher latency of CXL. The results show negligible performance degradation for TPC-C. For the analytical workloads of TPC-H, a notable impact on query processing is observed due to the limited bandwidth and long latency of our early CXL implementation. However, the emulation shows it would be acceptably smaller with the improved CXL memory devices.

 As computer and communication systems as well as other systems such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), Autonomous Robotic Systems become increasingly large and complex, their Dependability and Security play critical role at supporting next-generation science, engineering, and commercial applications. It remains a challenge to design, analyze, evaluate, and improve the dependability and security for a trusted computing environment. Trusted computing targets computing systems as well as services that are dependable, secure, protectable, predictable, traceable, controllable, autonomous, and sustainable.  
 At the same time, the increasing scale and complexity of systems call for the autonomic computing paradigm, which meets the requirements of self-management, and autonomous systems. Trusted and autonomic computing/autonomous systems need synergistic research efforts covering many disciplines, ranging from natural sciences to social sciences. It requires scientific and technological advances in a wide variety of fields, as well as new software, architectures, and communication technology that support the integration of the constituent technologies.  
 IEEE DASC 2023 will be held during November 13-17, 2023, in Abu DHbai, UAE co-located with IEEE CyberSciTech 2023  , IEEE PICom 2023  , and IEEE CBDCom 2023  . It aims to bring together computer scientists, industrial engineers, and researchers to discuss and exchange theoretical and implementation results, novel designs, work-in-progress, experience, case studies, and trend-setting ideas in the areas of dependability, security, trust and/or autonomic computing, and autonomous systems.
