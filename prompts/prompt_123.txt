  The International Conference on Case-Based Reasoning (ICCBR)  is the premier, annual meeting of the CBR community and the leading international conference on this topic. Researchers will present the latest results of their work and discuss future directions for the field.  
 CBR in a Data-Driven World  is this year’s conference theme, to direct the community’s attention to the need to highlight the role CBR can play in solving current problems and how it differs from other Machine Learning approaches. This year we pose the question: “What is the role of CBR in the modern data-driven world?” Accordingly, this year’s conference welcomes and encourages submissions and participation from members of the AI and CBR communities – whether they be researchers, policy makers or practitioners — on this theme. In this respect, we look forward to a variety of submissions; they could be position papers or road mapping proposals, as well as traditional basic or applied research papers.  
 Welcome to Scotland!  The 2023 edition of ICCBR will be in Aberdeen, Scotland. The program will include invited speakers, a main technical track, a workshop program, a doctoral consortium, and other events, with several connections to the Conference theme. We warmly welcome participation from all researchers and practitioners who have interest in case-based reasoning, including those who are working on related topics but have not previously attended ICCBR.

 ICCCI 2023 is an international scientific conference for research in the field of Computational Collective Intelligence, to be held on 27-29 September 2023 in Budapest, Hungary.  
 The aim of this conference is to provide an internationally respected forum for scientific research in the computer-based methods of collective intelligence and their applications. The scope of ICCCI 2023 includes all topics related with processing data and knowledge from autonomous sources, especially in: collective processing, knowledge integration, data integration, group decision making, multi-criteria decision making, consensus computing, and social networks.  
 The conference is jointly organized by Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE), Hungary and Wrocław University of Science and Technology, Poland in cooperation with IEEE SMC Technical Committee on Computational Collective Intelligence and European Research Center for Information Systems (ERCIS) and International University-VNU-HCM, Vietnam.  
 The proceedings of ICCCI 2023 will be published by Springer in series Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence LNCS/LNAI.  
 The conference is organized in a hybrid mode which allows for both on-site paper presentations and online presentations. The on-site part is the main mode of the hybrid conference. The online part is held for those participants who cannot travel to Budapest or cannot get Hungarian visa.

 Welcome to the 14th International Conference on Computational Creativity, ICCC’23!   
 Computational creativity is the art, science, philosophy, and engineering of computational systems which, by taking on particular responsibilities, exhibit behaviors that unbiased observers would deem to be creative. As a field of research, this area is thriving, with progress in formalizing what it means for software to be creative, along with many exciting and valuable applications of creative software in the sciences, the arts, literature, gaming, and elsewhere.  
 ICCC’23 will take place June 19 – June 23, 2023, at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada.
