 MABS 2023 - The 24th International Workshop on Multi-Agent-Based Simulation  
 multiagent systems  agent based modeling and simulation    
  ABOUT MABS  
 MABS 2023 is part of the AAMAS 2023 conference taking place in London, UK on  
  May 30, 2023.  
 The meeting of researchers from Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) engineering,  
  simulation, and the social, economic, and organizational sciences is extensively  
  from these fields has undoubtedly been an important source of inspiration for  
  the body of knowledge that has been produced in the area.  
 The MABS workshop series continues with its goal to bring together researchers  
  interested in MAS engineering and simulation, with researchers focused on  
  understanding and finding efficient solutions to model complex social and  
  exploration and testing of hypotheses, investigating better designs and systems.  
 TOPICS OF INTEREST  
 We welcome paper submissions from all areas of multi-agent-based simulation and  
  particularly also of work in early stages, which can benefit from active  
  discussions!  
 The range of technical issues that MABS has dealt with, and continues to deal  
  with, is quite diverse and extensive. Topics relevant to this workshop include,  
  but are not limited to:  
  *   Simulation   methodologies   and   tools   -   Standards   for   MABS   -   Methodologies   and   modeling   formalism   for   MABS   -   Methodologies   to   combine   MABS   with   other   modeling   approaches   -   Simulation   languages  ,   platforms   and   tools   for   MABS   -   Large  -  scale   and   distributed   MABS   -   Scalability   and   robustness   in   MABS   -   Future   challenges   in   MABS  *   Simulation   of   Social   and   Intelligent   behavior   -   Formal   and   agent   models   of   social   behavior   -   Cognitive   modeling   and   simulation   -   Game   theory   and   simulation   -   Social   structure  ,   social   networks   and   simulating   organizations   -   Simulating   social   complexity   (  e  .  g  .   structures   and   norms  ,   social   order  ,   emergence   of   cooperation   and   coordinated   action  ,   self  -  organization  ,   the   micro  -  macro   link  )  *   Applications   and   Empirical   Work   -   MABS   for   socio  -  ecological   systems   -   MABS   for   socio  -  technical   systems   -   Agent  -  based   experimental   economics   -   Participatory   and   Human  -  in  -  the  -  Loop   simulation   -   MABS   and   games   -   MABS   and   cloud   computing   -   MABS   in   governance   and   policy  -  making  *   Simulation   Analytics   -   Visualization   and   analytic   tools   for   MABS   -   Experimental   design   for   MABS   -   Statistical   and   data   analysis   methods   for   MABS   -   Data   mining   and   machine   learning   methods   for   MABS      
 MABS is a powerful tool that is being used to inform policy or decisions in  
  many fields of practical importance. The use of models in general, and MABS  
  in particular, during the COVID-19 pandemic has evidenced some of their  
  pitfalls to inform intervention policies. Thus, we propose for 2023 to  
  prioritize submissions of papers that explore how to tackle the pitfalls in  
  using MABS to inform policy making.  
 TARGET AUDIENCE  
 The workshop will provide a forum for social scientists, policy-makers, and  
  researchers committed to cross-cutting research that is complementary to  
  more orthodox modeling approaches.  
 MABS intends to be a place where researchers can exchange ideas about their  
  work and we are looking forward to the community meeting once again in  
  person.

  Toronto, Canada   
 ABOUT IEEE MASS 2023  
 IEEE MASS is a premier annual forum for sharing original, novel ideas in mobile ad-hoc networks and smart systems, defined broadly. As wireless ad-hoc networks continue to evolve and specialize into a number of application scenarios and environments, and sensor-based systems and technologies increasingly permeate our everyday life and become the inner fabric of the Internet of Things and cyber-physical systems, the unfolding of smart environments such as smart cities, smart farming, smart healthcare, and smart manufacturing, to name a few, demand integrated solutions that can make intelligent use of both cloud and edge systems, while applying machine learning and artificial intelligence tools to handle their growing complexity and to leverage the vast amount of available data created.  
 Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society and IEEE Computer Society's TCDP, the 20th edition of the IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Smart Systems (MASS) will be held in Toronto, Canada in September 2023, and it aims at bringing together researchers, developers, and practitioners to address recent advances in mobile ad-hoc and smart systems, covering algorithms, theory, protocols, systems & applications, experimental evaluations and testbeds, security/privacy, as well as AI/ML-based smart design.  
 Accepted papers for IEEE MASS 2023 will be included in IEEE Xplore Digital Library after they are presented at the conference. Information and instructions on how to prepare for a presentation will be provided. The organizing committee and the program committee will endeavor to ensure the high quality of the conference program and the excellent experience of conference authors and attendees. Thank you for your understanding and support!

 SCOPE AND OVERVIEW  
 The 2023 IEEE 20th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Smart Systems will be held in Toronto (Canada), September 25 – 27, 2023. The conference is sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society and IEEE Computer Society’s TCDP. It is a premier annual forum for sharing original, novel ideas in mobile ad-hoc networks and smart systems, defined broadly. As wireless ad-hoc networks continue to evolve and specialize into a number of application scenarios and environments, and sensor-based systems and technologies increasingly permeate our everyday life and become the inner fabric of the Internet of Things and cyber-physical systems, the unfolding of smart environments such as smart cities, smart farming, smart healthcare, and smart manufacturing, to name a few, demand integrated solutions that can make intelligent use of both cloud and edge systems, while applying machine learning and artificial intelligence tools to handle their growing complexity and to leverage the vast amount of available data created.  
 The MASS organizing committee invites proposals for full-day or half-day workshops affiliated with the conference. The purpose of these workshops is to provide a platform for presenting novel ideas in a less formal and possibly more focused way than at the conference itself. The goal is to enable stimulating discussions of state-of-the-art, emerging, visionary, and perhaps controversial topics. Workshop proposals are solicited in all areas and topics related to mobile ad-hoc and smart systems. Addressing emerging research directions in these areas are particularly welcome.  
 Accepted MASS 2023 workshop papers will be included in the conference proceeding published in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library, showing their affiliation with IEEE MASS. We expect all accepted workshops to adhere to a common paper submission (i.e., two-column IEEE conference style, maximum paper length of 6 pages) and reviewing schedule, as outlined in the dates indicated below.  
 SUBMISSION GUIDELINES FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS  
 Each workshop proposal must at least include:  
  1) Full name of the workshop and its intended acronym  
  2) Workshop Organizers (names, affiliation and contact information)  
  4) A brief description (up to 1 page) of the technical issues that the workshop will address, and the reasons why the workshop is of interest to MASS at this time.  
  5) Some consideration of the communities/groups the workshop intends to attract.  
  6) The names and affiliations of at least ten program committee member candidates.  
  10) A description of the publicity and promotion plan.  
 WORKSHOP PROPOSAL SUBMISSION  
 Workshop proposals should be sent in PDF format to the Workshop Co-chairs (Eirini Eleni Tsiropoulou <eirini@unm.edu>  and Nils Aschenbruck <aschenbruck@uos.de>  ).
