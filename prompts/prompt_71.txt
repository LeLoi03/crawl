  ##MORE##Engineering a software system can be a complex process and prone to failure. This is exacerbated when the system under consideration presents some degree of autonomy, such as in cognitive agents. In this paper, we use runtime verification as a way to enforce safety properties on Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents by enveloping certain plans in safety shields. These shields function as a failure handling mechanism, they can detect and avoid violations in shielded plans. The safety shields also provide automated failure recovery by attempting alternative execution paths to avoid violations.

  ##MORE##The diffusion model has demonstrated impressive performance in image generation, but its potential for discriminative tasks such as instance segmentation remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose an Instance-aware Diffusion Implicit Process (IDIP) framework for instance segmentation based on boxes. During training, IDIP diffuses ground-truth boxes across various time steps, extracting corresponding Region of Interest (RoI) features. Dynamic convolution is then used to predict boxes and categories for each RoI, and the mask head generates masks from these predictions. During inference, IDIP iteratively refines randomly generated boxes with the denoising diffusion implicit model, while the mask head derives final masks from RoIs based on the refined boxes. Our method surpasses existing approaches on the COCO benchmark, requiring fewer training steps and less memory resources due to its dynamic design and instance-aware characteristic.

  ##MORE##In the NLP domain, Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has gained significant attention in recent years due to its ability to perform fine-grained sentiment analysis. A challenging task in ABSA is Aspect Sentiment Quadruplet Extraction (ASQE), which involves the extraction of aspect terms and their associated opinion terms, sentiment polarities, and categories in the form of quadruplets. However, existing studies have ignored the strong dependence among the multiple subtasks involved in ASQE. In this paper, we propose a novel \textit{Enhanced Machine Reading Comprehension} (EMRC) method and formalize ASQE task as a multi-turn MRC task. Our EMRC effectively learns and utilizes the relationships among different subtasks by incorporating previously generated query answers into the current queries. We design a hierarchical category classification strategy to perform the category prediction in a structured manner, enabling the model to tackle intricate categories with ease. Furthermore, we employ the bi-directional attention mechanism, i.e., context-to-query and query-to-context attentions, to map the context into a task-aware representation. We conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that EMRC outperforms the state-of-art baselines.

  ##MORE##Equipped with the trained environmental dynamics, model-based offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can often successfully learn good policies from fixed-sized datasets, even some datasets with poor quality. Unfortunately, however, it can not be guaranteed that the generated samples from the trained dynamics model are reliable (e.g., some synthetic samples may lie outside of the support region of the static dataset). To address this issue, we propose Trajectory Truncation with Uncertainty (TATU), which adaptively truncates the synthetic trajectory if the accumulated uncertainty along the trajectory is too large. We theoretically show the performance bound of TATU to justify its benefits. To empirically show the advantages of TATU, we first combine it with two classical model-based offline RL algorithms, MOPO and COMBO. Furthermore, we integrate TATU with several off-the-shelf model-free offline RL algorithms, e.g., BCQ. Experimental results on the D4RL benchmark show that TATU significantly improves their performance, often by a large margin.

  ##MORE##Time series data are ubiquitous in real-world accompanied with missing values due to various collection faults. Thus Time-Series Data Imputation (TSDI) problem is crucial to many temporal data analysis tasks. Existing missing data imputation methods usually consider only one of the following issues: (1) temporal dependencies in each time series, and (2) inter-feature correlation. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, existing approaches that mask the data values for self-supervised TSDI model training use random masking only, which is far from the real complex missing situations. To achieve advanced performance on TDSI, we design a novel imputation model that delicately preserves the short-term, long-term, and inter-feature dependencies by attention mechanisms in a delay error-reduced bidirectional architecture. That is, it leverages GRU recurrent neural networks to model short-term temporal dependencies, and adopts Self-Attention (SA) mechanisms hierarchically to capture long-term temporal dependencies and inter-feature correlations. The multiple SAs are nested in a bidirectional structure to alleviate the problem of delay errors in RNN-like structures. To facilitate a model training with higher generality w.r.t. TSDI, a masking strategy that mimics various more extreme real missing situations beyond the simple random ones has been adopted for generating self-supervised tasks. Comprehensive experiments on real datasets demonstrates that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in various data missing scenarios, and boosts the performance of several main downstream time series data analysis tasks, i.e. , clustering, classification, and ranking.

  ##MORE##Split learning enables collaborative deep learning model training while preserving data privacy and model security by avoiding direct sharing of raw data and model details (i.e., sever and clients only hold partial sub-networks and exchange intermediate computations). However, existing research has mainly focused on examining its reliability for privacy protection, with little investigation into model security. Specifically, by exploring full models, attackers can launch adversarial attacks, and split learning can mitigate this severe threat by only disclosing part of models to untrusted servers. This paper aims to evaluate the robustness of split learning against adversarial attacks, particularly in the most challenging setting where untrusted servers only have access to the intermediate layers of the model. Existing adversarial attacks mostly focus on the centralized setting instead of the collaborative setting, thus, to better evaluate the robustness of split learning, we develop a tailored attack called SPADV, which comprises two stages: 1) shadow model training that addresses the issue of lacking part of the model and 2) local adversarial attack that produces adversarial examples to evaluate. The first stage only requires a few unlabeled non-IID data, and, in the second stage, SPADV perturbs the intermediate output of natural samples to craft the adversarial ones. The overall cost of the proposed attack process is relatively low, yet the empirical attack effectiveness is significantly high, demonstrating the surprising vulnerability of split learning to adversarial attacks.

  ##MORE##In multiagent systems (MASs), agents’ observation upon system behaviours may improve the overall team performance, but may also leak sensitive information to an observer. A quantified observability analysis can thus be useful to assist decision-making in MASs by operators seeking to optimise the relationship between performance effectiveness and information exposure through the observation in practice. This paper presents a novel approach to quantitatively analysing the observability properties in MASs. The concept of opacity is applied to formally express the characterisation of observability in MASs modelled as partially observable multiagent systems (POMASs). We propose a temporal logic oPATL to reason about agents’ observability with quantitative goals, which capture the probability of information transparency of system behaviours to an observer, and develop verification techniques for quantitatively analysing such properties.We also implement the approach as an extension of the probabilistic model checker PRISM, and illustrate its applicability via several examples.

  ##MORE##Belief-based programming is a probabilistic extension of the Golog programming language family, where every action and sensing could be noisy and every test refers to the subjective beliefs of the agent. Such characteristics make it rather suitable for robot control in a partial-observable uncertain environment. Recently, efforts have been made in providing formal semantics for belief programs and investigating the hardness of verifying belief programs. Nevertheless, a general algorithm that actually conducts the verification is missing. In this paper, we propose an algorithm based on symbolic dynamic programming to verify belief programs, an approach that generalizes the dynamic programming technique for solving (partially observable) Markov decision processes, i.e. (PO)MDP, by exploiting the symbolic structure in the solution of first-order (PO)MDPs induced by belief program execution.

  ##MORE##Inconsistency handling is a fundamental problem in knowledge representation and reasoning. In this paper, we study this problem in the context of qualitative spatio-temporal reasoning, a framework for reasoning about space and time in a symbolic, human-like manner, by following an approach similar to that used for defining paraconsistent logics; paraconsistency allows deriving informative conclusions from inconsistent knowledge bases by mainly avoiding the principle of explosion. Inspired by paraconsistent logics, such as Priest’s logic LPm, we introduce the notion of paraconsistent scenario (i.e., a qualitative solution), which can be seen as a scenario that allows a conjunction of base relations between two variables, e.g., x precedes ∧ follows y. Further, we present several interesting theoretical properties that concern paraconsistent scenarios, including computational complexity results, and describe two distinct approaches for computing paraconsistent scenarios and solving other related problems. Moreover, we provide implementations of our two methods for computing paraconsistent scenarios and experimentally evaluate them using different strategies/metrics. Finally, we show that our paraconsistent scenario notion allows us to adapt to qualitative reasoning one of the well-known inconsistency measures employed in the propositional case, namely, contension measure.

  ##MORE##Large Language Models have shown great capability to comprehend natural language and provide reasonable responses. However, previous research has shown weak performance of these models on low-resource (long-tail) languages. It remains to be a problem to mitigate the performance gap between long-tail languages and rich-resource ones, which is referred to as long-tail language representation collapsing. Though some previous works can generate pseudo parallel corpora with auto-regressive generation, this generation progress is time-consuming and remains low quality particularly for long-tail languages. In this paper, we propose a (X) Cross-lingual Bootstrapped Unsupervised Fine-tuning Framework (X-BUFF) to mitigate long-tail language representation collapsing. X-BUFF iteratively updates the cross-lingual PLM in a curriculum way. In each iteration of X-BUFF, we (1) select sentences with certain semantics from monolingual corpora in long-tail languages. (2) match these selected sentences with semantic equivalent sentences in many other languages to create parallel sentence pairs, which we then merge with previous sentence pairs to build a larger and more difficult bootstrapped parallel queue. (3) fine-tune the PLM with the bootstrapped parallel queue in a curriculum way. Extensive experiments show that X-BUFF can mitigate the long-tail language representation collapsing problem in cross-lingual PLMs and achieve significant improvements over the previous baseline on several cross-lingual evaluation benchmarks.

  ##MORE##Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable successes on a range of continuous control tasks due to its high sample efficiency. To save the computation cost of conducting planning online, recent practices tend to distill optimized action sequences into an RL policy during the training phase. Although the distillation can incorporate both the foresight of planning and the exploration ability of RL policies, the theoretical understanding of these methods is yet unclear. In this paper, we extend the policy improvement step of Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) by developing an approach to distill from model-based planning to the policy. We then demonstrate that such an approach of policy improvement has a theoretical guarantee of monotonic improvement and convergence to the maximum value defined in SAC. We discuss effective design choices and implement our theory as a practical algorithm---\textit{\textbf{M}odel-based \textbf{P}lanning \textbf{D}istilled to \textbf{P}olicy (MPDP)}---that updates the policy jointly over multiple future time steps. Extensive experiments show that MPDP achieves better sample efficiency and asymptotic performance than both model-free and model-based planning algorithms on six continuous control benchmark tasks in MuJoCo.

  ##MORE##In the sequential recommendation task, the recommender generally learns multiple embeddings from a user's historical behaviors, to catch the diverse interests of the user. Nevertheless, the existing approaches just extract each interest independently for the corresponding sub-sequence while ignoring the global correlation of the entire interaction sequence, which may fail to capture the user's inherent preference for the potential interests generalization and unavoidably make the recommended items homogeneous with the historical behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Scale Interest Extraction framework (DSIE) to precisely estimate the user's current interests. Specifically, DSIE explicitly models the user's inherent preference with contrastive learning by attending over his/her entire interaction sequence at the global scale and catches the user's diverse interests in a fine granularity at the local scale. Moreover, we develop a novel interest aggregation module to integrate the multi-interests according to the inherent preference to generate the user's current interests for the next-item prediction. Experiments conducted on three real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSIE outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of recommendation preciseness and novelty.

  ##MORE##Normalized-cut graph partitioning aims to divide the set of nodes in a graph into k disjoint clusters to minimize the fraction of the total edges between any cluster and all other clusters. In this paper, we consider a fair variant of the partitioning problem wherein nodes are characterized by a categorical sensitive attribute (e.g., gender or race) indicating membership to different demographic groups. Our goal is to ensure that each group is approximately proportionally represented in each cluster while minimizing the normalized cut value. To resolve this problem, we propose a two-phase spectral algorithm called FNM. In the first phase, we add an augmented Lagrangian term based on our fairness criteria to the objective function for obtaining a fairer spectral node embedding. Then, in the second phase, we design a rounding scheme to produce k clusters from the fair embedding that effectively trades off fairness and partition quality. Through comprehensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of FNM compared with three baseline methods.

  ##MORE##Argumentative explainable AI has been advocated by several in recent years, with an increasing interest on explaining the reasoning outcomes of Argumentation Frameworks (AFs). While there is a considerable body of research on qualitatively explaining the reasoning outcomes of AFs with debates/disputes/dialogues in the spirit of extension-based semantics, explaining the quantitative reasoning outcomes of AFs under gradual semantics has not received much attention, despite widespread use in applications. In this paper, we contribute to filling this gap by proposing a novel theory of Argument Attribution Explanations (AAEs) by incorporating the spirit of feature attribution from machine learning in the context of Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (QBAFs): whereas feature attribution is used to determine the influence of features towards outputs of machine learning models, AAEs are used to determine the influence of arguments towards topic arguments of interest. We study desirable properties of AAEs, including some new ones and some partially adapted from the literature to our setting. To demonstrate the applicability of our AAEs in practice, we conclude by carrying out two case studies in the scenarios of fake news detection and movie recommender systems.

  ##MORE##Model Reconciliation Problems (MRPs) and their variant, Logic-based MRPs (L-MRPs), have emerged as popular methods for explainable planning problems. Both MRP and L-MRP approaches assume that the explaining agent has access to an assumed model of the human user receiving the explanation, and it reconciles its own model with the human model to find the differences such that when they are provided as explanations to the human, they will understand them. However, in practical applications, the agent is likely to be fairly uncertain on the actual model of the human and wrong assumptions can lead to incoherent or unintelligible explanations. In this paper, we propose a less stringent requirement: the agent has access to a task-specific vocabulary known by the human and, if available, a human model capturing confidently known information. Our goal is to find a personalized explanation, which is an explanation that is at an appropriate abstraction level with respect to the human's vocabulary and model. Using a logic-based method called knowledge forgetting for generating abstractions, we propose a simple framework compatible with L-MRP approaches, and evaluate its efficacy through computational and human user experiments.

  ##MORE##Organizing agents into disjoint groups is a crucial challenge in artificial intelligence, with many applications where quick runtime is essential. The Simultaneous Coalition Structure Generation and Assignment (SCSGA) problem involves partitioning a set of agents into coalitions and assigning each coalition to a task, with the goal of maximizing social welfare. However, this is an NP-complete problem, and only a few algorithms have been proposed to address it for both small and large-scale problems. In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting a novel algorithm that can efficiently solve both small and large instances of this problem. Our method is based on a new search space representation, where each coalition is codified by an index. We have developed an algorithm that can explore this solution space effectively by generating index vectors that represent coalition structures. The resulting algorithm is anytime and can scale to large problems with hundreds or thousands of agents. We evaluated our algorithm on a range of value distributions and compared its performance against state-of-the-art algorithms. Our experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing methods in solving the SCSGA problem, providing high-quality solutions for a wide range of problem instances.

  ##MORE##This paper introduces a general approach for synthesizing procedural models of the {\em state-transitions} of a given {\em discrete system}.  
  The approach is general in that it accepts different {\em target languages} for modeling the state-transitions of a discrete system; different model acquisition tasks with different target languages, such as the synthesis of \strips{} action models, or the update rule of a {\em cellular automaton}, fit as particular instances of our general approach. We follow an inductive approach to synthesis meaning that a set of examples of state-transitions, represented as {\em (pre-state, action, post-state)} tuples, are given as input. The goal is to synthesize a structured program that, when executed on a pre-state, outputs the associated post-state. Our synthesis method implements a combinatorial search in the space of well-structured terminating programs that can be built using a {\em Random-Access Machine} (RAM), with a minimalist instruction set, and a finite amount of memory. The combinatorial search is guided with functions that asses the computational complexity of the candidate programs, as well as their fitness to the input set of examples.

  ##MORE##Evolutionary reinforcement learning (ERL) algorithms recently raise attention in tackling complex reinforcement learning (RL) problems due to high parallelism, while they are prone to insufficient exploration or model collapse without carefully tuning hyperparameters (aka meta-parameters). In the paper, we propose a general meta ERL framework via bilevel optimization (BiERL) to jointly update hyperparameters in parallel to training the ERL model within a single agent, which relieves the need for prior domain knowledge or costly optimization procedure before model deployment. We design an elegant meta-level architecture that embeds the inner-level's evolving experience into an informative population representation, and we introduce a simple and feasible evaluation of the meta-level fitness function to facilitate learning efficiency. We perform extensive experiments in MuJoCo and Box2D domains to verify that as a general framework, BiERL outperforms various baselines and consistently improves the learning performance for a diversity of ERL algorithms.

  ##MORE##Graph classification is a classic problem with practical applications in many real-life scenes. Existing graph neural networks, including GCN, GAT, and GIN, are proposed to extract useful features from complex graph structures.  
  However, the features extraction and aggregation manner of most existing methods inevitably mixes the useful and redundant features, which will disturb the final classification performance. In this paper, to handle the above drawback, we put forward Local Structural Separation Hypergraph Convolutional Neural Network (LoSS) based on two discoveries: most graph classification tasks only focus on a few groups of adjacent nodes, and different categories have their specific high response bits in graph embeddings. In LoSS, we first decouple the original graph into different hypergraphs and aggregate the features in each substructure, which aims to find useful features for the final classification. Next, the low-correlation feature suppression strategy is devised to suppress the irrelevant node-level and bit-level features in the forward inference process, which can effectively reduce the disturbance of redundant features. Experiments on five datasets show that the proposed LoSS can effectively locate and aggregate useful hypergraph features and achieve SOTA performance compared with existing methods.

  ##MORE##Recent work in Machine Learning and Computer Vision has highlighted the presence of various types of systematic flaws inside ground truth object recognition benchmark datasets. Our basic tenet is that these flaws are rooted in the many-to-many mappings which exist between the visual information encoded in images and the intended semantics of the labels annotating them. The net consequence is that the current annotation process is largely under-specified, thus leaving too much freedom to the subjective judgment of annotators. In this paper, we propose vTelos, an integrated Natural Language Processing, Knowledge Representation, and Computer Vision methodology whose main goal is to make explicit the (otherwise implicit) intended annotation semantics, thus minimizing the number and role of subjective choices. vTelos is organized around four main design choices, each focusing on a specific aspect of the annotation process. In this respect, visual properties are used to specify the relevant elements of an image and labels are associated with natural language genus-differentia definitions which describe the selected visual properties. In turn, these definitions are organized into a lexico-semantic hierarchy that captures their intrinsic recursive structure. The methodology is validated on images populating a subset of the ImageNet hierarchy.

  ##MORE##Calibration is paramount in developing and validating Machine Learning models, particularly in sensitive domains such as medicine. Despite its significance, existing metrics to assess calibration have been found to have shortcomings in regard to their interpretation and theoretical properties. This article introduces a novel and comprehensive framework to assess the calibration of Machine and Deep Learning models that addresses the above limitations. The proposed framework is based on a modification of the Expected Calibration Error (ECE), called the Estimated Calibration Index (ECI), which grounds on and extends prior research. ECI was initially formulated for binary settings, and we adapted it to fit multiclass settings. ECI offers a more nuanced, both locally and globally, and informative measure of a model's tendency towards over/underconfidence. The paper first outlines the issues related to the prevalent definitions of ECE, including potential biases that may arise in the evaluation of their measures. Then, we present the results of a series of experiments conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in supporting a more accurate understanding of a model's calibration level. Additionally, we discuss how to address and potentially mitigate some biases in calibration assessment.

  ##MORE##Personal assistants (PAs) such as Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant and Apple Siri are now widespread. However, without adequate safeguards and controls their use may lead to privacy risks and violations. In this paper, we propose a model for privacy-enhanced PAs. The model is an interpretable AI architecture that combines 1) a dialogue mechanism for understanding the user and getting online feedback from them, with 2) a decision making mechanism based on case-based reasoning considering both user and scenario similarity. We evaluate our model using real data about users' privacy preferences, and compare its accuracy and demand for user involvement with both online machine learning and other, more interpretable, AI approaches. Our results show that our proposed architecture is more accurate and requires less intervention from the users than existing approaches.

  ##MORE##Providing explanations for predictions of complex machine learning algorithms, including recommender systems, remains one of the biggest research challenges in AI. One form of such explanation that is particularly useful from the perspective of a non-expert user is an explanation expressed in natural language. Several methods for providing such explanations have recently been proposed for the recommendation task, however, we argue that an important aspect of explanation quality has been overlooked in their experimental evaluation. Specifically, the coherence between generated text and predicted rating, which is a necessary condition for an explanation to be useful, is not properly captured by currently used evaluation measures. In this paper, we highlight the issue of explanation and prediction coherence by 1) presenting results from a manual verification of explanations generated by one of the state-of-the-art approaches 2) proposing a method of automatic coherence evaluation 3) introducing a new transformer-based method that aims to produce more coherent explanations than the state-of-the-art approaches 4) performing an experimental evaluation which demonstrates that this method significantly improves the explanation coherence without affecting the other aspects of recommendation performance.

  ##MORE##Multi-domain learning (MDL) refers to simultaneously constructing a model or a set of models on datasets collected from different domains. Conventional approaches emphasize domain-shared information extraction and domain-private information preservation, following the shared-private framework (SP models), which offers signiﬁcant advantages over single-domain learning. However, the limited availability of annotated data in each domain considerably hinders the effectiveness of conventional supervised MDL approaches in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel method called multi-domain contrastive learning (MDCL) to alleviate the impact of insufﬁcient annotations by capturing both semantic and structural information from both labeled and unlabeled data. Speciﬁcally, MDCL comprises two modules: inter-domain semantic alignment and intra-domain contrast. The former aims to align annotated instances of the same semantic category from distinct domains within a shared hidden space, while the latter focuses on learning a cluster structure of unlabeled instances in a private hidden space for each domain. MDCL is readily compatible with many SP models, requiring no additional model parameters and allowing for end-to-end training. Experimental results across ﬁve textual and image multi-domain datasets demonstrate that MDCL brings noticeable improvement over various SP models. Furthermore, MDCL can further be employed in multi-domain active learning (MDAL) to achieve a superior initialization, eventually leading to better overall performance.

  ##MORE##Running out of GPU memory has become a main bottleneck for large-scale DNN training. How to reduce the memory footprint during training has received intensive research attention. We find that previous gradient accumulation reduces activation memory but fails to be compatible with gradient memory reduction due to a contradiction between preserving gradients and releasing gradients. To address this issue, we propose a novel optimizer accumulation method for Adam, named Adam Accumulation (AdamA), which enables reducing both activation and gradient memory. Specifically, AdamA directly integrates gradients into optimizer states and accumulates optimizer states over micro-batches, so that gradients can be released immediately after use. We mathematically and experimentally demonstrate AdamA yields the same convergence properties as Adam. Evaluated on transformer-based models, AdamA achieves up to 23% memory reduction compared to gradient accumulation with less than 2% degradation in training throughput. Notably, AdamA can work together with memory reduction methods for optimizer states to fit 1.26x~3.14x larger models over PyTorch and DeepSpeed baseline on GPUs with different memory capacities.

  ##MORE##Contract bridge is a game characterized by incomplete information, posing an exciting challenge for artificial intelligence methods. This paper proposes the BridgeHand2Vec approach, which leverages a neural network to embed a bridge player's hand (consisting of 13 cards) into a vector space. The resulting representation reflects the strength of the hand in the game and enables interpretable distances to be determined between different hands. This representation is derived by training a neural network to estimate the number of tricks that a pair of players can take. In the remainder of this paper, we analyze the properties of the resulting vector space and provide examples of its application in reinforcement learning, opening bid classification, and as an analysis tool for players. Although this was not our main goal, the neural network used for the vectorization achieves SOTA results on the DDBP2 problem (estimating the number of tricks for two given hands).

  ##MORE##Combinatorial reconfiguration studies how one solution of a combinatorial problem can be transformed into another. The transformation can only make small local changes and may not leave the solution space. An important example is the independent set reconfiguration (ISR) problem, where an independent set of a graph (a subset of its vertices without edges between them) has to be transformed into another one by a sequence of modifications that remove a vertex or add another that is not adjacent to any vertex in the set. The 1st Combinatorial Reconfiguration Challenge (CoRe Challenge 2022) was a competition focused on the ISR problem. The PARIS team participated with two solvers that model the ISR problem as a planning problem and employ different planning techniques for solving it. The solvers successfully competed in the challenge and were awarded 4 first, 3 second, and 3 third places across 9 tracks. In this work, we show how to model ISR problems as planning tasks and describe the planning techniques used by these solvers. For a fair comparison to competing ISR approaches, we re-run the entire competition under equal computational conditions. Besides showcasing the success of planning technology, we hope that this work will create a cross-fertilization of the two research fields.

  ##MORE##Sum-product networks guarantee that conditionals and marginals can be computed efficiently, for a wide range of models, bypassing the hardness of inference. However, this advantage comes at the expense of transparency, since it is unclear how variables interact in sum-product networks. Due to this, a series of decompilation algorithms transform sum-product networks back to Bayesian networks. In this work, we first study the transparency and causal utility of the resulting Bayesian networks. We then propose a novel decompilation algorithm to address the identified limitations.

  ##MORE##We consider the challenging scenario of contextual bandits with continuous actions and large context spaces. This is an increasingly important application area in personalised healthcare where an agent is requested to make dosing decisions based on a patient's single image scan. In this paper, we first adapt a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for continuous control to outperform contextual bandit algorithms specifically hand-crafted for continuous action spaces. We empirically demonstrate this on a suite of standard benchmark datasets for vector contexts. Secondly, we demonstrate that our RL agent can generalise problems with continuous actions to large context spaces, providing results that outperform previous methods on image contexts. Thirdly, we introduce a new contextual bandits test domain with multi-dimensional continuous action space and image contexts which existing tree-based methods cannot handle.

  ##MORE##In a multi-objective optimisation problem, when there is uncertainty regarding the correct user preference model, max regret is a natural measure for how far an alternative is from being necessarily optimal (i.e., optimal with respect to every candidate preference model). It can be used for recommending a relatively safe choice to the user, or used in the generation of an informative query, and in the decision to terminate the user interaction, because an alternative is sufficiently close to being necessarily optimal. We consider a common and simple form of user preference model: a weighted average over the objectives (with unknown weights). However, changing the scale of an objective by a linear factor leads to an essentially different set of preference models, and this changes the max regret values (and potentially their relative ordering), sometimes very considerably. Since the scaling of the objectives is often partly subjective and somewhat arbitrary, it is important to be aware of how sensitive the max regret values are to the choices of scaling of the objectives. We give mathematical results that characterise and enable computation of this variability, along with an asymptotic analysis.

  ##MORE##Machine Learning (ML) algorithms that perform classification may predict the wrong class, experiencing misclassifications. It is well-known that misclassifications may have cascading effects on the encompassing system, possibly resulting in critical failures. This paper proposes SPROUT, a Safety wraPper thROugh ensembles of UncertainTy measures, which suspects misclassifications by computing uncertainty measures on the inputs and outputs of a black-box classifier. If a misclassification is detected, SPROUT blocks the propagation of the output of the classifier to the encompassing system. The resulting impact on safety is that SPROUT transforms erratic outputs (misclassifications) into data omission failures, which can be easily managed at the system level. SPROUT has a broad range of applications as it fits binary and multi-class classification, comprising image and tabular datasets. We experimentally show that SPROUT always identifies a huge fraction of the misclassifications of supervised classifiers, and it is able to detect all misclassifications in specific cases. SPROUT implementation contains pre-trained wrappers, it is publicly available and ready to be deployed with minimal effort.

  ##MORE##The heavy ball momentum technique is widely used in accelerating the machine learning training process, which has demonstrated significant practical success in optimization tasks. However, most heavy ball methods require a preset hyperparameter that will result in excessive tuning, and a calibrated fixed hyperparameter may not lead to optimal performance. In this paper, we propose an adaptive criterion for the choice of the normalized momentum-related hyperparameter, motivated by the quadratic optimization training problem, to eliminate the adverse for tuning the hyperparameter and thus allow for a computationally efficient optimizer. We theoretically prove that our proposed adaptive method promises convergence for L-Lipschitz functions. In addition, we verify its practical efficiency on existing extensive machine learning benchmarks for image classification tasks. The numerical results show that besides the speed improvement, our proposed methods enjoy advantages, including more robust to large learning rates and better generalization.

  ##MORE##Games that are played in a dynamic (i.e., changing) game model have been studied in several contexts, such as cybersecurity and planning. In this paper, we introduce a logic for reasoning about a particular class of games with temporal goals played in a dynamic game model. In such games, the actions of a player can modify the game model itself. We show that the model-checking problem for our logic is decidable in polynomial-time. Then, using this logic, we show how to express interesting properties of cybersecurity games defined on attack graphs.

  ##MORE##In this paper we propose DKIBO, a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm that accommodates domain knowledge to tune exploration in the search space. Bayesian optimization has recently emerged as a sample-efficient optimizer for many intractable scientific problems. While various existing BO frameworks allow the input of prior beliefs to accelerate the search by narrowing down the space, incorporating such knowledge is not always straightforward and can often introduce bias and lead to poor performance. Here we propose a simple approach to incorporate structural knowledge in the acquisition function by utilizing an additional deterministic surrogate model to enrich the approximation power of the Gaussian process. This is suitably chosen according to structural information of the problem at hand and acts a corrective term towards a better-informed sampling. We empirically demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed method by successfully injecting domain knowledge in a materials design task. We further validate our method's performance on different experimental settings and ablation analyses.

  ##MORE##Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential for solving complex tasks in a variety of domains. However, applying RL to safety-critical systems in the real-world is a problem as many algorithms are sample inefficient and maximising the standard RL objective comes with no guarantees on worst case performance. In this paper we propose approximate model-based shielding (AMBS) a principled look-ahead shielding algorithm for verifying the performance of learned RL policies w.r.t a set of given safety-constraints. Our algorithm differs from other shielding approaches in that it does not require prior knowledge of the safety-relevant dynamics of the system. We provide a strong theoretical justification for AMBS and demonstrate superior performance to other safety-aware approaches on a small set of Atari games with state dependent safety labels.

  ##MORE##Due to the expensive segmentation annotation cost, cross-modality medical image segmentation aims to leverage annotations from a source modality (e.g. MRI) to learn a model for target modality (e.g. CT). In this paper, we present a novel method to tackle cross-modality medical image segmentation as semi-supervised multi-modal learning with image translation, which learns better feature representations and is more robust to source annotation scarcity. For semi-supervised multi-modal learning, we develop a deep co-training framework. We address the challenges of co-training on divergent labeled and unlabeled data distributions with a theoretical analysis on multi-view adaptation and propose decomposed multi-view adaptation, which shows better performance than a naive adaptation method on concatenated multi-view features. We further formulate inter-view regularization to alleviate overfitting in deep networks, which regularizes deep co-training networks to be compatible with the underlying data distribution. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate our framework. Our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods on three segmentation datasets, including two public datasets on cross-modality cardiac substructure segmentation and abdominal multi-organ segmentation and one large scale private dataset on cross-modality brain tissue segmentation. We will make our code publicly available.

  ##MORE##In many real-world multi-agent cooperative tasks, due to high cost and risk, agents cannot continuously interact with the environment and collect experiences during learning, but have to learn from offline datasets. However, the transition dynamics in the dataset of each agent can be much different from the ones induced by the learned policies of other agents in execution, creating large errors in value estimates. Consequently, agents learn uncoordinated low-performing policies. In this paper, we propose a framework for offline decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning, which exploits \textit{value deviation} and \textit{transition normalization} to deliberately modify the transition probabilities. Value deviation optimistically increases the transition probabilities of high-value next states, and transition normalization normalizes the transition probabilities of next states. They together enable agents to learn high-performing and coordinated policies. Theoretically, we prove the convergence of Q-learning under the altered \textit{non-stationary} transition dynamics. Empirically, we show that the framework can be easily built on many existing offline reinforcement learning algorithms and achieve substantial improvement in a variety of multi-agent tasks.

  ##MORE##Aggregating the noisy labels produced by the crowd of workers to generate true labels is a challenging problem in crowdsourcing. The key behind label aggregation is to effectively utilize the hidden information (e.g., characteristics of workers and questions which are often missing) in the labeling process. Existing methods mainly generated aggregation models based on the complicated Bayesian model or some strong assumptions. Recently, deep learning-based methods attempt to automate label aggregation but need various labels. These all make them hard to deploy to real-world applications. In fact, abundant information in the process of crowdsourcing itself can be extremely helpful to aggregate the labels. In this paper, we propose ATHENA (lAbel aggregation witH sElf-supervision eNhanced graph transformer) to aggregate labels by utilizing the self-supervision signals in crowdsourcing. Firstly, we propose a transformer-based graph neural network that can learn from the crowdsourcing topology and features. Then, we use self-supervision signals inherently included in the dataset to help to aggregate the labels. To be specific, we identify the answer-based self-supervision signal that can predict the answer of any user given to different tasks. In our evaluation, we compare the proposed ATHENA with the other 11 representative methods on 10 datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that ATHENA is highly effective in aggregating labels compared with the existing methods.

  ##MORE##Document-level event factuality identification (DocEFI) is an important task in event knowledge acquisition, which aims to detect whether an event actually occurs or not from the perspective of the document. Unlike the sentence-level task, a document can have multiple sentences with different event factualities, leading to event factuality conflicts in DocEFI. Existing studies attempt to aggregate local event factuality by exploiting document structures, but they mostly consider textual components in the document separately, degrading complicated correlations therein. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a novel approach, namely UR-HAT, to improve DocEFI with uncertain relational hypergraph attention networks. Particularly, we reframe a document graph as a hypergraph, and establish beneficial n-ary correlations among textual nodes with relational hyperedges, which helps to globally consider local factuality features to resolve event factuality conflicts. To better discern the importance of event factuality features, we further represent textual nodes with uncertain Gaussian distributions, and propose novel uncertain relational hypergraph attention networks to refine textual nodes with the document hypergraph. In addition, we select factuality-related keywords as nodes to enrich event factuality features. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and outperforms previous methods on two widely used benchmark datasets.

  ##MORE##One important and natural representation of preferences is a choice function, which returns the preferred options amongst any given subset of the alternatives. There are some very intuitive coherence conditions that might be assumed for an agent's choice function, in particular path independence, and a consistency condition stating that there is always at least one preferred alternative among any non-empty set. However, an elicited choice function may not satisfy path independence, because of the elicitation being incomplete, or because of there being some incoherence in the agent's reported choice function (despite the agent assenting to the general coherence conditions). Furthermore, if we wish to combine the choice functions of more than one agent, simple natural combination operations can lose path independence. This paper develops methods for enforcing path independence and restoring consistency, thus, making the user preferences coherent; this method also leads to approaches for combining two choice functions, in order to suggest the most promising alternatives for a pair of agents.

  ##MORE##Visual sentiment recognition is a challenging task with scientific significance in probing vision-processing mechanisms. Recent approaches mainly focused on using overall images or precise annotations to learn emotional representations, yet neglected to capture abstract semantics from regional information, or led to a heavy annotation burden. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end weakly supervised framework, called Dual Coding Network (DCNet), which models a dual coding process for both shallow features and high-level regional information. On the one hand, with the help of the fine-grained module (FG), visual features (e.g. texture features) are utilized to enhance the learning of distinguished representation. On the other hand, the DCNet innovatively leverages saliency information to imitate the neural decoding of perceived visual sentiment contents in human brain activity. Specifically, the saliency information guides the generation of sentiment-specific pseudo affective maps (SAMG), which serve as weak annotations. Then the DCNet couples fine-grained features with pseudo affective maps, and obtains semantic vectors for final sentiment prediction. Extensive experiments show that the proposed DCNet outperforms the state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark datasets.

  ##MORE##Monocular 3D object detection is an inherently ill-posed problem, as it is challenging to predict accurate 3D localization from a single image. Existing monocular 3D detection knowledge distillation methods usually project the LiDAR onto the image plane and train the teacher network accordingly. Transferring LiDAR-based model knowledge to RGB-based models is more complex, so a general distillation strategy is needed. To alleviate cross-modal problem, we propose MonoSKD, a novel Knowledge Distillation framework for Monocular 3D detection based on Spearman correlation coefficient, to learn the relative correlation between cross-modal features. Considering the large gap between these features, strict alignment of features may mislead the training, so we propose a looser Spearman loss. Furthermore, by selecting appropriate distillation locations and removing redundant modules, our scheme saves more GPU resources and trains faster than existing methods. Extensive experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of our framework on the challenging KITTI 3D object detection benchmark. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance until submission with no additional inference computational cost. Our code will be made public once accepted.

  ##MORE##Reasoning of complex logical queries on incomplete and massive knowledge graphs (KGs) remains a significant challenge. The prevailing method for this problem is query embedding, which embeds KG units (i.e., entities and relations) and complex queries into low-dimensional space. Recent developments in the field show that embedding queries as geometric shapes is a viable means for modeling entity set and logical relationships between them. Despite being promising, current geometric-based methods face challenges in capturing hierarchical structures of complex queries, which leaves considerable room for improvement. In this paper, we present POINE2, a geometric-based query embedding framework based on hyperbolic geometry to handle complex queries on knowledge graphs. POINE2 maps entities and queries as geometric shapes on a Cartesian product space of Poincaré ball spaces. To capture the hierarchical structures of complex queries, we use the Poincaré radius to represent the different levels of the hierarchy, and we use the aperture of the shape to indicate semantic differences at the same level of the hierarchy. Additionally, POINE2 offers a flexible and expressive definition of logical operations. Experimental results show that POINE2 outperforms existing salient geometric-based embedding methods, and achieves significant improvements over these methods on evaluation datasets.

  ##MORE##This paper proposes a simple-yet-efficient model, called capsule network with label dependency modeling (CapsLDM), for the task of multi-label emotion classification (MLEC) in text, in which multiple emotion categories can be assigned to the input data instance (e.g., a sentence). Unlike the traditional single-label emotion classification, the modeling of label (i.e., emotion) dependency plays an important role in MLEC, since the co-existing emotions in an utterance are not independent of each other. The capsule network has been successfully applied to many multi-label classification scenarios, however, the modeling of label dependency has not been considered in existing work. In our proposed CapsLDM model, we add similarity regularization terms on both the dynamic routing weights and the instance vectors of emotion capsules by exploiting the co-occurrence information of emotion labels, which resembles the dependency between different emotion categories for a certain input instance. Extensive experiments are conducted on four MLEC benchmark datasets with state-of-the-art models employed as baselines for comparison. The empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed CapsLDM model and confirm the effectiveness of label dependency modeling in CapsLDM for the MLEC task.

  ##MORE##Coping with distributional shifts is an important part of transfer learning methods in order to perform well in real-life tasks. However, most of the existing approaches in this area either focus on an ideal scenario in which the data does not contain noises or employ a complicated training paradigm or model design to deal with distributional shifts. In this paper, we revisit the robustness of the minimum error entropy (MEE) criterion, a widely used objective in statistical signal processing to deal with non-Gaussian noises, and investigate its feasibility and usefulness in real-life transfer learning regression tasks, where distributional shifts are common. Specifically, we put forward a new theoretical result showing the robustness of MEE against covariate shift. We also show that by simply replacing the mean squared error (MSE) loss with the MEE on basic transfer learning algorithms such as fine-tuning and linear probing, we can achieve competitive performance with respect to state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms. We justify our arguments on both synthetic data and 5 real-world time-series data.

  ##MORE##Due to the large number of submissions that more and more conferences experience, finding an automatized way to well distribute the submitted papers among reviewers has become necessary. We model the peer-reviewing matching problem as a {\it bilevel programming (BP)} formulation. Our model consists of a lower-level problem describing the reviewers' perspective and an upper-level problem describing the editors'. Every reviewer is interested in minimizing their overall effort, while the editors are interested in finding an allocation that maximizes the quality of the reviews and follows the reviewers' preferences the most. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed model is the first one that formulates the peer-reviewing matching problem by considering two objective functions, one to describe the reviewers' viewpoint and the other to describe the editors' viewpoint. We demonstrate that both the upper-level and lower-level problems are feasible and that our BP model admits a solution under mild assumptions. After studying the properties of the solutions, we propose a heuristic to solve our model and compare its performance with the relevant state-of-the-art methods. Extensive numerical results show that our approach can find fairer solutions with competitive quality and less effort from the reviewers.

  ##MORE##To understand the algorithm that supports the human brain's language representation, previous research has attempted to predict neural responses to linguistic stimuli using embeddings generated by artificial neural networks (ANNs), a process known as neural encoding. However, most of these studies have focused on probing neural representations of Germanic languages, such as English, with unsupervised ANNs. In this paper, we propose to bridge the gap between human brain and supervised ANN representations of the Chinese language. Specifically, we investigate how task tuning influences a pretained Transformer for neural encoding and which tasks lead to the best encoding performances. We generate supervised representations on eight Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks using prompt-tuning, a technique that is seldom explored in neural encoding for language. We demonstrate that prompt-tuning yields representations that better predict neural responses to Chinese stimuli than traditional fine-tuning on four tasks. Furthermore, we show that tasks that require a fine-grained processing of concepts and entities lead to representations that are most predictive of brain activation patterns. Additionally, we find that the proportion of tuned parameters highly influences the neural encoding performance of fine-tuned models. Overall, our experimental findings could help us better understand the relationship between supervised artificial and brain language representations.

  ##MORE##Abusive language is a concerning problem in online social media. Past research on detecting abusive language covers different platforms, languages, demographies, etc. However, models trained using these datasets do not perform well in cross-domain evaluation settings. To overcome this, a common strategy is to use a few samples from the target domain to train models to get better performance in that domain (cross-domain few-shot training). However, this might cause the models to overfit the artefacts of those samples. A compelling solution could be to guide the models toward rationales, i.e., spans of text that justify the text's label. This method has been found to improve model performance in the in-domain setting across various NLP tasks. In this paper, we propose RGFS (Rationale-Guided Few-Shot Classification) for abusive language detection. We first build a multitask learning setup to jointly learn rationales, targets, and labels, and find a significant improvement of 6% macro F1 on the rationale detection task over training solely rationale classifiers. We introduce two rationale-integrated BERT-based architectures (the RGFS models) and evaluate our systems over five different abusive language datasets, finding that in the few-shot classification setting, RGFS-based models outperform baseline models by about 7% in macro F1 scores and perform competitively to models finetuned on other source domains. Furthermore, RGFS-based models outperform LIME/SHAP-based approaches in terms of plausibility and are close in performance in terms of faithfulness.

  ##MORE##Conventional humor analysis normally focuses on text, text-image pair, and even long video (e.g., monologue) scenarios. However, with the recent rise of short-form video sharing, humor detection in this scenario has not yet gained much exploration. To the best of our knowledge, there are two primary issues associated with short-form video humor detection (SVHD): 1) At present, there are no ready-made humor annotation samples in this scenario, and it takes a lot of manpower and material resources to obtain a large number of annotation samples; 2) Unlike the more typical audio and visual modalities, the titles (as opposed to simultaneous transcription in the lengthy film) and associated interactive comments in short-form videos may convey apparent humorous clues. Therefore, in this paper, we first collect and annotate a video dataset from DouYin (aka. TikTok in the world), namely DY24h, with hierarchical comments. Then, we also design a novel approach with comment-aided multi-modal heterogeneous pre-training (CMHP) to introduce comment modality in SVHD. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that our CMHP beats several existing video-based approaches on DY24h, and that the comments modality further aids a better comprehension of humor. Our dataset, code, and model parameters will be released at Github upon acceptance.

  ##MORE##The capability of continuously learning new skills via a sequence of pre-collected offline datasets is desired for an agent. However, consecutively learning a sequence of offline tasks likely leads to the catastrophic forgetting issue under resource-limited scenarios. In this paper, we formulate a new setting, continual offline reinforcement learning (CORL), where an agent learns a sequence of offline reinforcement learning tasks and pursues good performance on all learned tasks with a small replay buffer without exploring any of the environments of all the sequential tasks. For consistently learning on all sequential tasks, an agent requires acquiring new knowledge and meanwhile preserving old knowledge in an offline manner. To this end, we introduced continual learning algorithms and experimentally found experience replay (ER) to be the most suitable algorithm for the CORL problem. However, we observe that introducing ER into CORL encounters a new distribution shift problem: the mismatch between the experiences in the replay buffer and trajectories from the learned policy. To address such an issue, we propose a new model-based experience selection (MBES) scheme to build the replay buffer, where a transition model is learned to approximate the state distribution. This model is used to bridge the distribution bias between the replay buffer and the learned model by filtering the data from offline data that most closely resembles the learned model for storage. Moreover, in order to enhance the ability on learning new tasks, we retrofit the experience replay method with a new dual behavior cloning (DBC) architecture to avoid the disturbance of behavior-cloning loss on the Q-learning process. In general, we call our algorithm offline experience replay (OER). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our OER method outperforms SOTA baselines in widely-used Mujoco environments.

  ##MORE##Class-incremental learning (CIL) has attracted much attention in deep learning due to the challenge problem of catastrophic forgetting. Various methods have been proposed for CIL, including exemplar-based class-incremental learning (EBCIL), non-exemplar class-incremental learning (NECIL) and data-free class-incremental learning (DFCIL). Without storing any information (such as examples and prototypes) about the old classes, DFCIL is obviously the most challenging one. To address the problem of lacking information in DFCIL and with the assumption that the learned representations are not linearly separable, we propose a method called IRP. We use the L2-similarity classifier instead of the FC classifier, where each weight vector represents a prototype that implicitly records information about the classes. We use representation-prototype distance minimization (RPDM) to solve the problem of loose representation caused by overfitting. To alleviate the excessive deviation of old prototypes under long-term CIL, we add prototype changing limitation (PCL) and prototype momentum updating (PMU) in incremental stages. In addition, we design a method for resampling around old prototypes (RAOP) to maintain the decision boundary of the old classes. Numerous experiments on three benchmarks have shown that IRP is significantly superior to other DFCIL methods and performs comparably to NECIL and partial EBCIL methods.

  ##MORE##Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) is a widely-used explainability method for isolating the average effect of a feature on the output, because it handles cases with correlated features well. However, it has two limitations. First, it does not quantify the deviation of instance-level (local) effects from the average (global) effect, known as heterogeneity. Second, for estimating the average effect, it partitions the feature domain into user-defined, fixed-sized bins, where different bin sizes may lead to inconsistent ALE estimations. To address these limitations, we propose Robust and Heterogeneity-aware ALE (RHALE). RHALE quantifies the heterogeneity by considering the standard deviation of the local effects and automatically determines an optimal variable-size bin-splitting. In this paper, we prove that to achieve an unbiased approximation of the standard deviation of local effects within each bin, bin splitting must follow a set of sufficient conditions. Based on these conditions, we propose an algorithm that automatically determines the optimal partitioning, balancing the estimation bias and variance. Through evaluations on synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of RHALE compared to other methods, including the advantages of automatic bin splitting, especially in cases with correlated features.

  ##MORE##Unsupervised hashing aims to learn a compact binary hash code to represent complex image content without label information. Existing deep unsupervised hashing methods typically first employ extracted image embeddings to construct semantic similarity structures and then map the images into compact hash codes while preserving the semantic similarity structure. However, the limited representation power of embeddings in Euclidean space and the inadequate exploration of the similarity structure in current methods often result in poorly discriminative hash codes. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Hyperbolic Multi-Structure Hashing (HMSH) to address these issues. Specifically, to increase the representation power of embeddings, we propose to map embeddings from Euclidean space to hyperbolic space and use the similarity structure constructed in hyperbolic space to guide hash learning. Meanwhile, to fully explore the structural information, we investigate four kinds of data structures, including local neighborhood structure, global clustering structure, inter/intra-class variation and variation under perturbation. Different data structures can complement each other, which is conducive to hash learning. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark image datasets show that HMSH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised hashing methods for image retrieval.

  ##MORE##Cell type classification serves as one of the most fundamental analyses in bioinformatics. It helps recognizing various cells in cancer microenvironment, discovering new cell types and facilitating other downstream tasks. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology can profile the whole transcriptome of each cell, thus enabling cell type classification. However, high-dimensional scRNA-seq data pose serious challenges on cell type classification. Existing methods either classify the cells with reliance on the prior knowledge or by using neural networks whose massive parameters are hard to interpret. In this paper, we propose two novel attention-based models for cell type classification on single-cell RNA-seq data. The first model, Cell Feature Attention Network (CFAN), captures the features of a cell and performs attention model on them. To further improve interpretation, the second model, Cell-Gene Representation Attention Network (CGRAN), directly concretizes tokens as cells and genes and uses the cell representation renewed by self-attention over the cell and the genes to predict cell type. Both models show excellent performance in cell type classification; additionally, the key genes with high attention weights in CGRAN indicate and identify the marker genes of the cell types, thus proving the model’s biological interpretation.

  ##MORE##Decentralized learning (DL) has recently employed local updates to reduce the communication cost for general non-convex optimization problems. Specifically, local updates require each node to perform multiple update steps on the parameters of the local model before communicating with others. However, most existing methods could be highly sensitive to data heterogeneity (i.e., non-iid data distribution) and adversely affected by the stochastic gradient noise. In this paper, we propose DSE-MVR to address these problems. Specifically, DSE-MVR introduces a dual-slow estimation strategy that utilizes the gradient tracking technique to estimate the global accumulated update direction for handling the data heterogeneity problem; also for stochastic noise, the method uses the mini-batch momentum-based variance-reduction technique. We theoretically prove that DSE-MVR can achieve optimal convergence results for general non-convex optimization in both iid and non-iid data distribution settings. In particular, the leading terms in the convergence rates derived by DSE-MVR are independent of the stochastic noise for large-batches or large partial average intervals (i.e., the number of local update steps). Further, we put forward DSE-SGD and theoretically justify the importance of the dual-slow estimation strategy in the data heterogeneity setting. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to show the superiority of DSE-MVR against other state-of-the-art approaches.

  ##MORE##Novel object captioning task aims at describing objects that are absent from training data. Due to the scarcity of novel objects, it's challenging to find a way to utilize external data to improve model's reasoning ability. While previously designed methods all follow a deep learning approach, we boost novel object captioning by incorporating knowledge reasoning with a traditional deep learning framework. We design a manual from dictionaries that provides our model with sufficient and accurate external information on novel objects. We propose a Manual-guided Context-aware Novel Object Captioning model (MC-NOC) that utilizes image and caption context to reason novel object captions. It contains a Manual-Guided Novel Object Reasoning module to reason novel objects based on other objects of the given image. And a Caption Reconstruction module to incorporate novel objects into generated captions according to caption context. We validate MC-NOC with state-of-the-art performance on the challenging Held-out COCO and Nocaps dataset, leading their leaderboard. In particular, we improved the CIDER metric by 6.4 points on the held-out coco dataset. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our model's reasoning capability and the quality of generated captions.

  ##MORE##In many situations, several agents need to make a sequence of decisions. For example, a group of workers that needs to decide where their weekly meeting should take place. In such situations, a decision-making mechanism must consider fairness notions. In this paper, we analyze the fairness of three known mechanisms: round-robin, maximum Nash welfare, and leximin. We consider both offline and online settings, and concentrate on the fairness notion of proportionality and its relaxations. Specifically, in the offline setting, we show that the three mechanisms fail to find a proportional or approximate-proportional outcome, even if such an outcome exists. We thus introduce a new fairness property that captures this requirement, and show that a variant of the leximin mechanism satisfies the new fairness property. In the online setting, we show that it is impossible to guarantee proportionality or its relaxations. We thus consider a natural restriction on the agents' preferences, and show that the leximin mechanism guarantees the best possible additive approximation to proportionality and satisfies all the relaxations of proportionality.

  ##MORE##The ability to navigate robots with natural language instructions in an unknown environment is a crucial step for achieving embodied artificial intelligence (AI). With the improving performance of deep neural models proposed in the field of vision-and-language navigation (VLN), it is equally interesting to know what information the models utilize for their decision-making in the navigation tasks. To understand the inner workings of deep neural models, various explanation methods have been developed for promoting explainable AI (XAI). But they are mostly applied to classification models and little work has been done in explaining the deep neural models for VLN tasks. In this paper, we address these problems by building quantitative benchmarks to evaluate explanation methods for VLN models in terms of faithfulness. We propose a new erasure-based evaluation pipeline to measure the step-wise textual explanation in the sequential decision-making setting. We evaluate several explanation methods for two representative VLN models on two popular VLN datasets and reveal valuable findings through our experiments.

  ##MORE##Multiple intent detection and slot filling are two fundamental and crucial tasks in spoken language understanding. Motivated by the fact that the two tasks are closely related, joint models that can detect intents and extract slots simultaneously are preferred to individual models that perform each task independently. The accuracy of a joint model depends heavily on the ability of the model to transfer information between the two tasks so that the result of one task can correct the result of the other. In addition, since a joint model has multiple outputs, how to train the model effectively is also challenging. In this paper, we present a method for multiple intent detection and slot filling by addressing these challenges. First, we propose a bidirectional joint model that explicitly employs intent information to recognize slots and slot features to detect intents. Second, we introduce a novel method for training the proposed joint model using supervised contrastive learning and self-distillation. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets MixATIS and MixSNIPS show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both tasks. The results also demonstrate the contributions of both bidirectional design and the training method to the accuracy improvement.

  ##MORE##Automated planning research often focuses on developing new algorithms to improve the computational performance of planners, but effective implementation can also play a significant role. Hardware features such as memory hierarchy can yield substantial running time improvements when optimized. In this paper, we investigate and compare the cache performance of various MDP planners, while proposing two state-reordering techniques for the Topological Value Iteration (TVI) algorithm. Our first technique organizes states in memory so that those belonging to the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC) are contiguous, while our second technique optimizes state value propagation by reordering states within each SCC. We analyze existing planning algorithms with respect to their cache efficiency and describe domain characteristics which can provide an advantage to each of them. Empirical results show that, in many instances, our new algorithms, called eTVI and eiTVI, run several times faster than traditional VI, TVI, LRTDP and ILAO* techniques.

  ##MORE##Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular global optimization scheme for sample-efficient optimization in domains with expensive function evaluations. The existing BO techniques are capable of finding a single global optimum solution. However, finding a set of global and local optimum solutions is crucial in a wide range of real-world problems, as implementing some of the optimal solutions might not be feasible due to various practical restrictions (e.g., resource limitation, physical constraints, etc.). In such domains, if multiple solutions are known, the implementation can be quickly switched to another solution, and the best possible system performance can still be obtained. This paper develops a multimodal BO framework to effectively find local/global solutions for expensive-to-evaluate multimodal objective functions. We consider the standard BO setting with Gaussian process regression representing the objective function. We analytically derive the joint distribution of the objective function and its first-order derivatives. This joint distribution is used in the body of the BO acquisition functions to search for local optima during the optimization process. We introduce variants of the well-known BO acquisition functions to the multimodal setting and demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework in locating a set of local optimum solutions using multiple optimization problems.

  ##MORE##Session-based Recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the next item for a session, which consists of several clicked items in a transaction. Most SBR approaches follow an underlying assumption that all sequential information should be strictly utilized. Thus, they model temporal information for items using implicit, explicit, or ensemble methods. In fact, users may recall previously clicked items but might not remember the exact order in which they were clicked. Therefore, focusing on representing item temporal information in various ways could make learning session intents challenging. In this paper, we rethink the necessity of temporal information for items in SBR. We propose Aggregating the Contextual intents of the session with Attentive networks, namely ACARec. Specifically, we avoid explicitly modeling positional embeddings and learn contextual intents through aggregation methods (convolutions or poolings). We also demonstrate that even an entirely position-agnostic aggregation approach can yield promising results. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate our arguments. We hope our study can provide insights into SBR and inspire future research in the community.

  ##MORE##Recently, there has been a surge in the use of generated data to enhance the performance of downstream models, largely due to the advancements in pre-trained language models. However, most prevailing methods trained generative and discriminative models in isolation, which left them unable to adapt to changes in each other. These approaches lead to generative models that are prone to deviating from the true data distribution and providing limited benefits to discriminative models. While some works have proposed jointly training generative and discriminative language models, their methods remain challenging due to the non-differentiable nature of discrete data. To overcome these issues, we introduce a self-consistent learning framework in text domain that involves training a discriminator and generator cooperatively in a closed-loop manner until a scoring consensus is reached. By learning directly from selected samples, our framework are able to avoid training instabilities such as mode collapse and non-convergence. Extensive experiments on four downstream benchmarks, including AFQMC, CHIP-STS, QQP, and MRPC, demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework.

  ##MORE##Class incremental learning (CIL) requires a model to learn the knowledge of new classes without overwriting that of old classes. The main challenge thus lies in catastrophic forgetting. Among all advances in addressing this challenge, rehearsal-based methods are the most widely-used due to their convenience and effectiveness. However, the (classification) scores bias between the old and new classes, known as the main cause of catastrophic forgetting for rehearsal-based methods, is still not fully addressed. Although some recent strategies are proposed to reduce the scores bias, they either take extra training time or sacrifice too much performance on the current task. In this paper, we propose a novel Robust Self-Taught Task-Wise Reweighting (R-STAR) method, which can act as a flexible and key component for improving existing rehearsal-based methods. Concretely, on top of the standard training process, it measures the forgetting degree of the model over the augmented buffer (for robust evaluation) on each task. Further, following the self-taught paradigm, it directly activates the task-wise forgetting degree into a reweighting ratio for scores bias reduction during the inference stage. Extensive experiments show that our R-STAR can improve most rehearsal-based methods with remarkable margins, but with (almost) no extra training cost or excessive performance sacrifice on the new task. Moreover, it also shows its advantages over existing scores bias correction strategies.

  ##MORE##Chance constraints are frequently used to limit the probability of constraint violations in real-world optimization problems where the constraints involve stochastic components. We study chance-constrained submodular optimization problems, which capture a wide range of optimization problems with stochastic constraints. Previous studies considered submodular problems with stochastic knapsack constraints in the case where uncertainties are the same for each item that can be selected. However, uncertainty levels are usually variable with respect to the different stochastic components in real-world scenarios, and rigorous analysis for this setting is missing in the context of submodular optimization. This paper provides the first such analysis for the case, where the weights of items have the same expectation but different dispersion. We present greedy algorithms that can obtain a high-quality solution, i.e., a constant approximation ratio to the given optimal solution from the deterministic setting. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the algorithms perform effectively on several chance-constrained instances of the maximum coverage problem and the influence maximization problem.

  ##MORE##Diverse, top-k and top-quality planning are concerned with the generation of sets of solutions to sequential decision problems. Previously this area has been the domain of classical planners that require a symbolic model of the problem instance. This paper proposes a novel alternative approach that instead uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), enabling application to problems for which only a black-box simulation model is available. We present a procedure for extracting bounded sets of plans from preconstructed search trees in best-first order, along with a metric for evaluating the relative quality of paths through a search tree. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in a path-planning domain with hidden information, and suggest adaptations to the basic MCTS algorithm to increase the diversity of generated plans.

  ##MORE##Existing weakly-supervised temporal sentence grounding methods typically regard query reconstruction as the pretext task in place of the absent temporal supervision. However, their approaches suffer from two flaws, i.e. insignificant reconstruction and discrepancy in alignment. Insignificant reconstruction indicates the randomly masked words may not be discriminative enough to distinguish the target event from unrelated events in the video. Discrepancy in alignment indicates the incorrect partial alignment built by query reconstruction task. The flaws undermine the reliability of current reconstruction-based methods. To this end, we propose a novel Self-improving Query ReconstrucTion (SQRT) framework for weakly-supervised temporal sentence grounding. To deal with insignificant reconstruction, we devise a key words mining strategy to determine the important words for language grounding. To attain better moment-query alignment, we introduce inter-sample contrast to tackle the partial alignment built by query reconstruction. The self-improving framework leverages query reconstruction for language grounding and alleviates the discrepancy in alignment, thus turning on the right track. Experiments on two popular datasets show that SQRT achieves state-of-the-art performance on Charades-STA and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art on ActivityNet Captions.

  ##MORE##Abductive explanations (AXp's) are widely used for understanding decisions of classifiers. Existing definitions are suitable when features are independent. However, we show that ignoring constraints when they exist between features may lead to an explosion in the number of redundant or superfluous AXp's. We propose three new types of explanations that take into account constraints and that can be generated from the whole feature space or from a sample (such as a dataset). They are based on a key notion of coverage of an explanation, the set of instances it explains. We show that coverage is powerful enough to discard redundant and superfluous AXp's. For each type, we analyse the complexity of finding an explanation and investigate its formal properties. The final result is a catalogue of different forms of AXp's with different complexities and different formal guarantees.

  ##MORE##When assessing uncertainty in model predictions, it is key to consider potential error patterns in some regions of the feature space. In this paper, we build on quantile regression to propose a new method to produce prediction intervals in regression tasks. It estimates a conditional quantile function of the residual variable given a specific representation. The method then adjusts the regressor's prediction with an upper and lower conditional quantile prediction in order to produce an adaptive prediction interval for any new input. Further, we suggest an additional layer based on conformal prediction in order to provide coverage guarantees. Lastly, as distribution-free conditional coverage is impossible to achieve, we suggest a tree-based representation which displays patterns of undercoverage. This diagnostic tool aims to reveal which regions of the feature space are significantly less likely to have trustworthy prediction intervals. In order to prove their efficacy, our techniques are tested over various use cases and compared against four main baselines. Our methods empirically achieve the expected coverage and tend to produce shorter intervals.

  ##MORE##Offline optimization aims to elaborately construct an output solution that optimizes a black-box function with only access to the offline dataset. It is in great demand when active evaluation is expensive or even infeasible. A typical manner of constructing the output solution is to train a surrogate model of the black-box function based on the offline dataset and optimize the solution guided by the surrogate model. However, this manner often encounters a fundamental challenge that the surrogate model could erroneously estimate out-of-distribution (OOD) solutions. Therefore, the optimizer would be misled to produce inferior output solutions for online applications, i.e., degradation of performance. To this end, this paper formalizes the risk of degradation for OOD solutions and proposes an accumulative risk controlled offline optimization (ARCOO) method based on the energy model. Specifically, ARCOO learns a surrogate model in conjunction with an energy model. The energy model explicitly characterizes the risk of degradation by learning on high-risk solutions and low-risk ones contrastively. In the optimization procedure, the behavior of the optimizer in each step is controlled by a risk suppression factor calculated via the energy model, which leads to the controllable accumulative risk. Theoretically, we justify the efficacy of energy for accumulative risk control. Extensive experiments on offline optimization tasks such as drug discovery, material invention, and robotic design show that ARCOO surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both degradation-resistance and optimality of the output solution.

  ##MORE##In recent years, autonomous agents have been increasingly handling decision tasks on behalf of their human users. One such type of task with much potential to be carried out by an assisting autonomous agent is optimal stopping (e.g., in costly search). In such case, when it is the agent's responsibility to decide when to terminate search, the challenge of maximizing user satisfaction with the process becomes acute. This paper provides evidence for the loose correlation between agent performance, profit-wise, and user satisfaction in this application domain, ruling out the use of the profit-maximizing strategy. As an alternative, it proposes a strategy relying on behavioral features. An extensive comparative evaluation of the proposed strategy, as well as the profit-maximizing strategy and the highest ranked strategy elicited through crowdsourcing reveals that the average satisfaction with the first is substantially greater than when experiencing with the others. The analysis of the results also reveals several important insights related to people's ability to estimate the effectiveness of search strategies, satisfaction-wise, or propose such strategies themselves, contributing to the study of how human beings deal with optimal stopping problems in practice.

  ##MORE##Semantic text matching has a wide range of applications in natural language processing. Recently proposed models that have achieved excellent results on short text matching tasks are not well suited to long-form text matching problems due to input length limitations and increased noise. On the other hand, long-form texts contain a large amount of information at different granularities after encoding, which cannot be fully interacted and utilized by existing methods. To address above issues, we propose a novel long-form text-matching framework which \textbf{f}uses \textbf{B}i-Encoder and \textbf{C}ross-Encoder (\textbf{FBC}). Specially, it first employs an entity-driven key sentence extraction method to obtain the crucial content of the text and filter out noise. Subsequently, it integrates Bi-Encoder and Cross-Encoder to better capture semantic features and matching signals. Extensive experiments on several publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, compared with strong competitors. Furthermore, our model exhibits greater stability and accuracy in determining the matching relationship between documents describing the same event, which outperforms previously established approaches.

  ##MORE##Reconstructing visual stimuli from human brain activities provides a promising opportunity to advance our understanding of the brain's visual system and its connection with computer vision models. Although deep generative models have been employed for this task, the challenge of generating high-quality images with accurate semantics persists due to the intricate underlying representations of brain signals and the limited availability of parallel data. In this paper, we propose a two-phase framework named Contrast and Diffuse (CnD) to decode realistic images from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings. In the first phase, we acquire representations of fMRI data through self-supervised contrastive learning. In the second phase, the encoded fMRI representations condition the diffusion model to reconstruct visual stimulus through our proposed concept-aware conditioning method. Experimental results show that CnD reconstructs highly plausible images on challenging benchmarks. We also provide a quantitative interpretation of the connection between the latent diffusion model (LDM) components and the human brain's visual system. In summary, we present an effective approach for reconstructing visual stimuli based on human brain activity and offer a novel framework to understand the relationship between the diffusion model and the human brain visual system.

  ##MORE##Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs) are prevalent in real-world systems. Recent advances in network embedding provide an effective way of encoding HINs into low-dimensional vectors. However, there is a growing concern that existing HIN embedding algorithms may suffer from the problem of generating biased representations, resulting in discrimination against certain demographic groups. In this paper, we propose a flexible debiasing framework for fair HIN embedding to address this issue. Specifically, we first formalize measurements and the definition of fairness in HIN embedding. Then, we propose a debiasing framework named FairHGNN, including a novel meta-path sampling method that focuses on mitigating the bias in random walks, and a fairness constraint with Wasserstein distance to alleviate the algorithmic bias in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Experimental results on real-world datasets validate the efficacy of FairHGNN in promoting fairness and maintaining comparable embedding utility.

  ##MORE##The enhancement of unsupervised learning of sentence representations has been significantly achieved by the utility of contrastive learning. This approach clusters the augmented positive instance with the anchor instance to create a desired embedding space. However, relying solely on the contrastive objective can result in sub-optimal outcomes due to its inability to differentiate subtle semantic variations between positive pairs. Specifically, common data augmentation techniques frequently introduce semantic distortion, leading to a semantic margin between the positive pair. While the InfoNCE loss function overlooks the semantic margin and prioritizes similarity maximization between positive pairs during training, leading to the insensitive semantic comprehension ability of the trained model. In this paper, we introduce a novel Identical and Fraternal Twins of Contrastive Learning (named IFTCL) framework, capable of simultaneously adapting to various positive pairs generated by different augmentation techniques. We propose a \textit{Twins Loss} to preserve the innate margin during training and promote the potential of data enhancement in order to overcome the sub-optimal issue. We also present proof-of-concept experiments combined with the contrastive objective to prove the validity of the proposed Twins Loss. Furthermore, we propose a hippocampus queue mechanism to restore and reuse the negative instances without additional calculation, which further enhances the efficiency and performance of the IFCL. We verify the IFCL framework on nine semantic textual similarity tasks with both English and Chinese datasets, and the experimental results show that IFCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

  ##MORE##Task-incremental person re-identification aims to train a model with consecutively available cross-camera annotated data in the current task and a small number of saved data in preceding tasks, which may lead to individual privacy disclosure due to data storage and annotation. In this work, we investigate a more realistic online privacy preservation scenario for camera-incremental person re-identification, where data storage in preceding cameras is not allowed, while data in the current camera are intra-camera annotated online by a pedestrian tracking algorithm without cross-camera annotation. In this setup, the missing data of previous cameras not only results in catastrophic forgetting as task-incremental learning, but also makes the cross-camera association infeasible, which further leads to the incapability of person matching across cameras due to the camera-wise domain gap. To solve these problems, we propose an Online Privacy Preservation (OPP) framework based on the generated exemplars of previous cameras by DeepInversion, where generated exemplars used as supplements to alleviate forgetting and enable cross-camera association to be feasible for camera-wise domain shift mitigation, meanwhile further improving the cross-camera matching capability. Specifically, we propose to mine underlying cross-camera positive pairs between samples of the current camera and exemplars of previous cameras by similarity cues. Furthermore, we introduce a mixup learning strategy to handle the domain gap with mixed samples and labels. Finally, intra-camera incremental learning and cross-camera incremental learning are aggregated into the OPP framework. Extensive experiments on Re-ID benchmarks validate the superiority of the OPP framework as compared with state-of-the-art methods.

  ##MORE##Cognitive diagnosis is vital for intelligent education to determine students' knowledge mastery levels from their response logs. The Q-matrix, representing the relationships between exercises and knowledge attributes, improves the interpretability of cognitive diagnosis model. However, completing the Q-matrix poses an expensive and challenging task due to the fine-grained division of knowledge attributes. Moreover, a manually sparse Q-matrix can also compromise the accuracy and interpretability of deducing students' mastery levels, especially for infrequently observed or unseen knowledge attributes. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Q-augmented Causal Cognitive Diagnosis Model (QCCDM) for student learning. Specifically, QCCDM incorporates the structure causal model (SCM) to capture the causality between students' mastery levels on different attributes, which enables to infer their proficiency on rarely observed knowledge attributes with better accuracy and interpretability. Notably, with SCM, one can guide students on how to realize their self-improvement through intervention. Furthermore, we propose to augment the Q-matrix in QCCDM, which uses the manual Q-matrix as a prior to deduce the relationships between exercises and explicit as well as latent knowledge attributes, resulting in a complete and comprehensive assessment of students' abilities. We assess the efficacy of Q-augmentation across the widely-used Q-based cognitive diagnosis models and conduct the ablation study. The extensive experimental results on real-world datasets show that QCCDM outperforms the compared methods in terms of both accuracy and interpretability.

  ##MORE##Understanding the reasons behind the prediction of a predictive model is crucial for many applications. To that end, different explainable models are developed to provide explanations by finding the contribution of features to the prediction of a black-box model. However, the interactions among features are ignored, and the attribution of contributions is typically limited to individual features. In this paper, we develop a Choquet integral-based explainable method, or ChoquEx, that is able to account for the interactions among features and compute also the contributions of any subset of features. Accordingly, we develop an algorithm based on support vector regression that estimates the contributions of all subsets of features in an efficient manner. The feature importance and the interaction index are then calculated by using game-theoretic notions, such as Shapley values and interaction index. Experiments on several real scenarios show the superiority of the proposed model.

  ##MORE##Code generation focuses on automatically converting natural language (NL) utterances into code snippets. Sequence-to-tree (Seq2Tree) approaches are proposed for code generation with the aim of ensuring grammatical correctness of the generated code. These approaches generate subsequent Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) nodes based on the preceding predictions of AST nodes. However, existing Seq2Tree approaches tend to treat both antecedent predictions and subsequent predictions equally, which poses a challenge for models to produce accurate subsequent predictions if the antecedent predictions are incorrect under the constraints of the AST. Given this challenge, it is necessary to pay more attention to antecedent predictions compared to subsequent predictions. To this end, this paper proposes a novel and effective method, named Antecedent Prioritized (AP) Loss, which prioritizes antecedent predictions by leveraging the position information of the generated AST nodes. We design an AST-to-Vector (AST2Vec) method that maps AST node positions to two-dimensional vectors, thereby modeling the position information of AST nodes. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed loss, we implement and train an Antecedent Prioritized Tree-based code generation model called APT. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that with better antecedent predictions and accompanying subsequent predictions, APT achieves significant improvements, indicating the superiority and generality of our proposed method.

  ##MORE##Our goal in this paper is to significantly decrease the compiled size of a given Boolean instance with a large representation, while preserving as much information about the instance as possible. We achieve this by assigning values to a subset of the variables of the instance, in such a way that the resulting instance has a much smaller representation than the original one, and its number of solutions is almost as high as the starting one. We call the set of variable assignments that we make the selective backbone of the solutions that we keep. Large selective backbones allow for smaller representations, but also eliminate more solutions. We compare different methods of computing the selective backbone that offers the best compromise.

  ##MORE##The paper presents a novel SMT-based method for testing the satisfiability of formulae that express strategic properties of timed multi-agent systems represented by networks of timed automata. Strategic Metric Temporal Logic (SMTL) is introduced, which extends Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) with strategy operators. SMTL is interpreted over maximal continuous time runs of timed automata. We define a procedure that synthesizes a model for a given SMTL formula if such a model exists. The method exploits Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) techniques and Parametric Bounded Model Checking algorithms. The presented approach enables bounded satisfiability checking, where the model is partially given and needs to be completed in line with the given specification. Our method has been implemented, and its application is demonstrated through an example of the well-known dining philosophers problem extended with clocks and strategies. The experimental results are quite encouraging.

  ##MORE##Time-to-event analysis, also known as survival analysis, aims to predict the time of occurrence of an event, given a set of features. One of the major challenges in this area is dealing with censored data, which can make learning algorithms more complex. Traditional methods such as Cox's proportional hazards model and the accelerated failure time (AFT) model have been popular in this field, but they often require assumptions such as proportional hazards and linearity. In particular, the AFT models often require pre-specified parametric distributional assumptions.  
  To improve predictive performance and alleviate strict assumptions, there have been many deep learning approaches for hazard-based models in recent years. However, representation learning for AFT has not been widely explored in the neural network literature, despite its simplicity and interpretability in comparison to hazard-focused methods.  
  In this work, we introduce the Deep AFT Rank-regression model for Time-to-event prediction (DART). This model uses an objective function based on Gehan's rank statistic, which is efficient and reliable for representation learning.  
  On top of eliminating the requirement to establish a baseline event time distribution, DART retains the advantages of directly predicting event time in standard AFT models. The proposed method is a semiparametric approach to AFT modeling that does not impose any distributional assumptions on the survival time distribution. This also eliminates the need for additional hyperparameters or complex model architectures, unlike existing neural network-based AFT models. Through quantitative analysis on various benchmark datasets, we have shown that DART has significant potential for modeling high-throughput censored time-to-event data.

  ##MORE##General Game Playing (GGP), a research field aimed at developing agents that master different games in a unified way, is regarded as a necessary step towards creating artificial general intelligence. With the success of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in games like Go, chess, and shogi, it has been recently introduced to GGP and is regarded as a promising technique to achieve the goal of GGP. However, the current work uses fully connected neural networks and is thus unable to efficiently exploit the topological structure of game states. In this paper, we propose an approach to applying general-purposed convolutional neural networks to GGP and implement a DRL-based GGP player. Experiments indicate that the built player not only outperforms the previous algorithm and UCT benchmark in a variety of games but also requires less training time.

  ##MORE##Existing deep subspace clustering algorithms are difficult to scale to large-scale data. There are two reasons: Firstly, the existing subspace clustering algorithms almost all need to find the self-expressive coefficient matrix whose size is proportional to the square of the data set size at once. Secondly, spectral clustering needs to solve the eigenvector of the affinity matrix. These two points make the computational complexity of clustering very high when the data scale is large. This paper proposes Self-Expressive Network-Based Deep Embedded Subspace Clustering (SE-DESC), a subspace clustering method that can be applied to large-scale single-view and multi-view data. Using the idea of siamese networks, we design a self-expressive network to calculate the self-expressive coefficient between two data points, reducing the parameter amount of the self-expressive model to a constant. It can effectively avoid computational complexity. Then, we use a deeply embedded network to learn an embedding for each data point to map the data into the spectral space, avoiding the high computational complexity of spectral clustering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SE-DESC improves the clustering performance on large-scale data compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  ##MORE##3D hand reconstruction from RGB image has attracted a lot of attention due to its important role in human-computer interaction. However, it is still challenging to perform 3D hand reconstruction under hand-object interaction due to severe mutual occlusion. Previous methods usually adopt fixed convolution kernel to extract features. We argue that simply sharing the static filter for all regions are impertinent, since the occlusion degree of different regions are different, resulting in inconsistent visual representations. Therefore, we proposed Region-aware Dynamic Filtering Network (\textbf{RDFNet}), which dynamically generates convolution kernels according to the features of different regions, so as to adaptively extract region-related information. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic receptive field selection mechanism to determine the most appropriate scale for the convolution kernel. For the severely occluded regions, larger receptive field is needed to capture semantic-related features, while the visible regions are mainly concerned with their own local pattern to accumulate spatial-related features and avoid the interference of irrelevant information. Our proposed RDFNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on several challenging hand-object interaction datasets. We will make our code be available.

  ##MORE##Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved promising results in recent years. However, most of the existing reinforcement learning methods require a large amount of data for model training. In addition, data-efficient reinforcement learning requires the construction of strong inductive biases, which are ignored in the current MARL approaches. Inspired by the symmetry phenomenon in multi-agent systems, this paper proposes a framework for exploiting prior knowledge by integrating a symmetry augmentation and a well-designed consistency loss into the existing MARL methods. In addition, the proposed framework is model-agnostic and can be applied to most of the existing MARL algorithms. Experimental tests on multiple challenging tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Moreover, the proposed framework is applied to a physical multi-robot testbed to show its superiority.

  ##MORE##Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capacity for in-context learning (ICL), where learning a new task from just a few training examples is done without being explicitly pre-trained. However, despite the success of LLMs, there has been little understanding of how ICL learns the knowledge from the given prompts. In this paper, to make progress toward understanding the learning behaviour of ICL, we train the same LLMs with the same demonstration examples via ICL and supervised learning (SL), respectively, and investigate their performance under label perturbations (i.e., noisy labels and label imbalance) on a range of classification tasks. First, via extensive experiments, we find that gold labels have significant impacts on the downstream in-context performance, especially for large language models; however, imbalanced labels matter little to ICL across all model sizes. Second, when comparing with SL, we show empirically that ICL is less sensitive to label perturbations than SL, and ICL gradually attains comparable performance to SL as the model size increases.

  ##MORE##Users have the right to have their data deleted by third-party learned systems, as codified by recent legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Such data deletion can be achieved by full re-training, but this incurs a high computational cost for modern machine learning methods. To avoid this cost, many approximate deletion methods have been developed for supervised learning. Unsupervised learning, in contrast, remains largely an open problem when it comes to efficient approximate data deletion. In this paper, we introduce (1) an efficient method for approximate deletion in generative models, and (2) statistical tests for estimating whether training points have been deleted. We provide theoretical guarantees under various learner assumptions. We then empirically demonstrate our methods across a variety of generative methods.

  ##MORE##Multi-task learning (MTL) improves generalization by sharing information among related tasks. Structured sparsity-inducing regularization has been widely used in MTL to learn interpretable and compact models, especially in high-dimensional settings. These methods have achieved much success in practice, however, there are still some key limitations, such as limited generalization ability due to specific sparse constraints on parameters, usually restricted in matrix form that ignores high-order feature interactions among tasks, and formulated in various forms with different optimization algorithms. Inspired by Generalized Lasso, we propose the Generalized Group Lasso (GenGL) to overcome these limitations. In GenGL, a linear operator is introduced to make it adaptable to diverse sparsity settings, and helps it to handle hierarchical sparsity and multi-component decomposition in general tensor form, leading to enhanced flexibility and expressivity. Based on GenGL, we propose a novel framework for Structured Sparse MTL (SSMTL), that unifies a number of existing MTL methods, and implement its two new variants in shallow and deep architectures, respectively. An efficient optimization algorithm is developed to solve the unified problem, and its effectiveness is validated by synthetic and real-world experiments.

  ##MORE##Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, involuntary facial expressions that reveal genuine emotions, making their accurate detection crucial in various applications, such as security, psychology, and human-computer interaction. Due to its small intensity and short duration, how accurately capturing the subtle movements of micro-expression is a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel AU prototype-based method for micro-expression spotting, which offers high accuracy and robustness. Action Units (AUs) are basic facial actions, such as brow lower and lip corner puller, that are widely used for micro-expression analysis, and an expression can be encoded as a sequence of AUs. Our approach involves designing AU prototypes that record representative dynamic information of AUs. We then calculate the prototype matching index between AU prototypes and the image sequence to construct time-domain prototype matching curves for ME spotting. In the experimental section, AU prototypes derived from CASMEII dataset enable a more intuitive analysis of AU within micro-expressions. Results on the CAS(ME)2 dataset demonstrate that our ME spotting method significantly outperforms existing approaches. This makes our method highly valuable for various application scenarios, potentially enhancing emotion recognition and analysis in real-world settings.

  ##MORE##Accurate and real-time traffic state prediction is of great practical importance for urban traffic control and web mapping services. With the support of massive data, deep learning methods have shown their powerful capability in capturing the complex spatial-temporal patterns of traffic networks. However, existing approaches use pre-defined graphs and a simple set of spatial-temporal components, making it difficult to model multi-scale spatial-temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic graph convolution network with attention fusion to tackle this gap. The method first enhances the interaction of temporal feature dimensions, and then it combines a dynamic graph learner with GRU to jointly model synchronous spatial-temporal correlations. We also incorporate spatial-temporal attention modules to effectively capture long-range, multifaceted domain spatial-temporal patterns. We conduct extensive experiments in four real-world traffic datasets to demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art performance compared to 18 baseline methods.

  ##MORE##In Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF) problems, multiple agents move simultaneously to reach their individual destinations without colliding with each other. The computational complexity of the problem has been extensively studied for undirected graphs over the past decades. However, plan existence for Directed MAPF (diMAPF) was only recently studied and was shown to be in PSPACE as well as NP-hard. In this paper, we study the optimization versions (on makespan and on travel distance of agents) of diMAPF problems and show that they remain NP-hard even when various important non-trivial restrictions are imposed (e.g., when considering the problem on directed, acyclic, and planar graphs where the vertex-degrees are bounded). We have also provide membership results, thus presenting the first set of NP-completeness results for various optimal diMAPF variants.

  ##MORE##General language models have shown success in various information retrieval (IR) tasks, but their effectiveness is limited in the biomedical domain due to the specialized and complex nature of biomedical data. However, training domain-specific models is challenging and costly due to the limited availability of annotated data. To address these issues, we propose the Diversified Prior Knowledge Enhanced General Language Model (DPK-GLM) framework, which integrates domain knowledge with general language models for improved performance in biomedical IR. Our two-stage retrieval framework comprises a Knowledge-based Query Expansion method for enriching biomedical knowledge, an Aspect-based Filter for identifying highly-relevant documents, and a Diversity-based Score Reweighting method for re-ranking retrieved documents. Experimental results on public biomedical IR datasets show significant improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

  ##MORE##Attention models are typically learned by optimizing one of three standard loss functions that are variously called – soft attention, hard attention, and latent variable marginal likelihood (LVML) attention. All three paradigms are motivated by the same goal of finding two models– a ‘focus’ model that ‘selects’ the right segment of the input and a ‘classification’ model that processes the selected segment into the target label. However, they differ significantly in the way the selected segments are aggregated, resulting in distinct dynamics and final results. We observe a unique signature of models learned using these paradigms and explain this as a consequence of the evolution of the classification model under gradient descent when the focus model is fixed. We also analyze these paradigms in a simple setting and derive closed-form expressions for the parameter trajectory under gradient flow. With the soft attention loss, the focus model improves quickly at initialization and splutters later on. On the other hand, hard attention loss behaves in the opposite fashion. Based on our observations, we propose a simple hybrid approach that combines the advantages of the different loss functions and demonstrates it on a collection of semi-synthetic and real-world datasets.

  ##MORE##One design strategy for developing intelligent agents is to create N distinct behaviors, each of which works effectively in particular tasks and circumstances. At each time step during task execution, the agent, or bandit, chooses which of the N behaviors to use. Traditional bandit algorithms for making this selection often (1) assume the environment is stationary, (2) focus on asymptotic performance, and (3) do not incorporate external information that is available to the agent. Each of these simplifications limits these algorithms such that they often cannot be used successfully in practice. In this paper, we propose a new bandit algorithm, called AlegAATr, as a step toward overcoming these deficiencies. AlegAATr leverages a technique called Assumption-Alignment Tracking (AAT), proposed previously in the robotics literature, to predict the performance of each behavior in each situation. It then uses these predictions to decide which behavior to use at any given time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AlegAATr in selecting behaviors in three problem domains: repeated games, ad hoc teamwork, and a human-robot pick-n-place task.

  ##MORE##Multi-agent active search requires autonomous agents to choose sensing actions that efficiently locate targets. In a realistic setting, agents also must consider the costs that their decisions incur. Previously proposed active search algorithms simplify the problem by ignoring uncertainty in the agent's environment, using myopic decision making, and/or overlooking costs. In this paper, we introduce an online active search algorithm to detect targets in an unknown environment by making adaptive cost-aware decisions regarding the agent's actions. Our algorithm proposes an online lookahead planner that combines priniciples from Monte Carlo Tree Search, Thompson sampling and pareto-optimal confidence bounds for decentralized multi-agent multi-objective optimization in an unknown environment. We analyze the algorithm's performance in simulation to show its efficacy in cost-aware active search.

  ##MORE##Recently, Pure-Past Temporal Logic (PPLTL) has been shown to be very effective for specifying temporally extended goals in deterministic planning domains. In this paper, we show its effectiveness also for FOND planning, both for strong and strong-cyclic plans. We present a notably simple encoding of FOND planning for PPLTL goals into standard FOND planning for reachability goals. The encoding only introduces few fluents (at most linear in the PPLTL goal) without adding any spurious action and allows planners to lazily build the relevant part of the DFA for the goal formula on-the-fly during the search. We formally prove its correctness, implement it in a tool called Plan4Past, and experimentally show its practical effectiveness.

  ##MORE##Due to limited camera capacities, digital images usually have a narrower dynamic illumination range than real-world scene radiance. To resolve this problem, High Dynamic Range (HDR) reconstruction is proposed to recover the dynamic range to better represent real-world scenes. However, due to different physical imaging parameters, the tone-mapping functions between images and real radiance are highly diverse, which makes HDR reconstruction extremely challenging. Existing solutions can not explicitly clarify a corresponding relationship between the tone-mapping function and the generated HDR image, but this relationship is vital when guiding the reconstruction of HDR images. To address this problem, we propose a method to explicitly estimate the tone mapping function and its corresponding HDR image in one network. Firstly, based on the characteristics of the tone mapping function, we construct a model by a polynomial to describe the trend of the tone curve. To fit this curve, we use a learnable network to estimate the coefficients of the polynomial. This curve will be automatically adjusted according to the tone space of the Low Dynamic Range (LDR) image, and reconstruct the real HDR image. Besides, since all current datasets do not provide the corresponding relationship between the tone mapping function and the LDR image, we construct a new dataset with both synthetic and real images. Extensive experiments show that our method generalizes well under different tone-mapping functions and achieves SOTA performance.

  ##MORE##In this article we study the problem of credal learning, a general form of weakly supervised learning in which instances are associated with credal sets (i.e., closed, convex sets of probabilities), which are assumed to represent the partial knowledge of an annotating agent about the true conditional label distribution. A variety of algorithms have been proposed in this setting, chiefly among them the generalized risk minimization method, a class of algorithms that extend empirical risk minimization. Despite its popularity and promising empirical results, however, the theoretical properties of this algorithm (as well as of credal learning more in general) have not been previously studied. In this article we address this gap by studying the problem of credal learning from the learning-theoretic and complexity-theoretic perspectives. We provide, in particular, three main contributions: 1) we show that, under weak assumptions about the accuracy of the annotating agent, credal learning is learnable in the convex learning setting, providing effective risk bounds; 2) we study the properties of generalized risk minimization and, in particular, identify the optimal instance of this approach, that we call trade-off risk minimization; 3) we study the computational complexity of generalized risk minimization, showing effective algorithms based on gradient descent and providing sufficient and necessary conditions for them being computationally efficient.

  ##MORE##In the digital age, data is a valuable commodity, and data marketplaces offer lucrative opportunities for data owners to monetize their private data. However, data privacy is a significant concern, and differential privacy has become a popular solution to address this issue. Private data trading systems (PDQS) facilitate the trade of private data by determining which data owners to purchase data from, the amount of privacy purchased, and providing specific aggregation statistics while protecting the privacy of data owners. However, existing PDQS with separated procurement and query processes are prone to over-perturbation of private data and lack trustworthiness. To address this issue, this paper proposes a framework for PDQS with an integrated procurement and query process to avoid excessive perturbation of private data. We also present two instances of this framework, one based on a greedy approach and another based on a neural network. Our experimental results show that both of our mechanisms outperformed the separately conducted procurement and query mechanism under the same budget regarding accuracy.

  ##MORE##Regular Decision Processes (RDPs) are a recently introduced model for decision making in non-Markovian domains in which states are not postulated a-priori, and the next observation depends in a regular manner on past history. As such, they provide a more succinct and understandable model of the dynamics and reward function. Existing algorithms for learning RDPs attempt to learn an automaton that reflects the regularity of the underlying domain. However, their scalability is limited due to the practical difficulty of learning automata. In this paper we propose to leverage the power of Deep reinforcement learning in partially observable domain to learn RDPs: First, we learn an RNN-based policy. Then, we generate an automaton that reflects the policy’s structure, and use our old data to transform it into an MDP, which we solve. This results in both a more explainable policy structure, and, as our empirical evaluation on old and new RDP benchmarks shows, better sample-complexity.

  ##MORE##Stories about everyday situations are an essential part of human communication, motivating the need to develop AI agents that can reliably understand these stories. Despite the long list of supervised methods for story completion and procedural understanding, current AI fails to generalize its procedural reasoning to unseen stories. This paper is based on the hypothesis that the generalization can be improved by associating downstream prediction with fine-grained modeling and the abstraction of procedural knowledge in stories. To test this hypothesis, we design LEAP: a comprehensive framework that reasons over stories by jointly considering their (1) overall plausibility, (2) conflict sentence pairs, and (3) participant physical states. LEAP integrates state-of-the-art modeling architectures, training regimes, and augmentation strategies based on natural and synthetic stories. To address the lack of densely annotated training data on participants and their physical states, we devise a robust automatic labeler based on semantic parsing and few-shot prompting with large language models. Our experiments with in- and out-of-domain tasks reveal insights into the interplay of architectures, training regimes, and augmentation strategies. LEAP’s labeler consistently improves performance on out-of-domain datasets, while our case studies show that the dense annotation supports explainability.

  ##MORE##Pareto optimization using evolutionary multi-objective algorithms has been widely applied to solve constrained submodular optimization problems. A crucial factor determining the runtime of the used evolutionary algorithms to obtain good approximations is the population size of the algorithms which grows with the number of trade-offs that the algorithms encounter. In this paper, we introduce a sliding window speed up technique for recently introduced algorithms. We prove that our technique eliminates the population size as a crucial factor negatively impacting the runtime and achieves the same theoretical performance guarantees as previous approaches within less computation time. Our experimental investigations for the classical maximum voverage problem confirms that our sliding window technique clearly leads to better results for a wide range of instances and constraint settings.

  ##MORE##Story Ending Generation is the task of generating a coherent and sensible ending for a given story. The key challenges of this task are i) how to obtain a good understanding of context, ii) how to capture hidden information between lines, and iii) how to obtain causal progression. However, recent machine learning-based models can only partially address these challenges due to the lack of causal entailment and consistency. The key novelty in our proposed approach is to capture the hidden story by generating transitional commonsense sentences between each adjacent context sentence, which substantially enriches causal and consistent story flow. Specifically, we adopt a soft causal relation using people's everyday commonsense knowledge to mimic the cognitive understanding process of readers. We then enrich the story with causal reasoning and utilize dependency parsing to capture long-range text relations. Finally, we apply multi-level Graph Convolutional Networks to deliver enriched contextual information across different layers. Both automatic and human evaluation results show that our proposed model can significantly improve the quality of generated story endings.

  ##MORE##Learning effective strategies in sparse reward tasks is one of the fundamental challenges in reinforcement learning. This becomes extremely difficult in multi-agent environments, as the concurrent learning of multiple agents induces the non-stationarity problem and sharply increased joint state space. Existing works have attempted to promote multi-agent cooperation through experience sharing. However, learning from a large collection of shared experiences is inefficient as there are only a few high-value states in sparse reward tasks, which may instead lead to the curse of dimensionality in large-scale multi-agent systems. This paper focuses on sparse-reward multi-agent cooperative tasks and proposes an effective experience-sharing method MASL (Multi-Agent Selective Learning) to boost sample-efficient training by reusing valuable experiences from other agents. MASL adopts a retrogression-based selection method to identify high-value traces of agents from the team rewards, based on which some recall traces are generated and shared among agents to motivate effective exploration. Moreover, MASL selectively considers information from other agents to cope with the non-stationarity issue while enabling efficient training for large-scale agents. Experimental results show that MASL significantly improves sample efficiency compared with state-of-art MARL algorithms in cooperative tasks with sparse rewards.

  ##MORE##Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (Co-MARL) commonly employs different parameter sharing mechanisms, such as full and partial sharing. However, imprudent application of these mechanisms can potentially constrain policy diversity and limit cooperation flexibility. Recent methods that group agents into distinct sharing categories often exhibit poor performance due to challenges in precisely differentiating agents and neglecting the issue of promoting cooperation among these categories. To address these issues, we introduce a dynamic selective parameter sharing mechanism embedded with multi-level reasoning abstractions (DSPS-MA). Our approach uses self-comparison sequences to infer agents' abstract concepts, defining the differences between agents and allowing them to dynamically select partners to share parameters based on these abstract concepts. We also design an intrinsic reward to offer comprehensive collaboration guidance for agents, and introduce a policy cosine similarity regularization term to ensure sufficient policy diversity. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach yields higher returns and faster convergence than state-of-the-art methods.

 ##MORE##This paper introduces a motivated agent scheme that enables an agent to create its own goals using prior knowledge about its environment. A motivated agent operates in a dynamically changing environment and is capable of setting and achieving its own goals, as well as those set by the designer. The agent has access to additional knowledge about the environment, which is represented in associative semantic memory. This memory is constructed based on ANAKG associative knowledge graphs, which have been shown to have several advantages over other semantic memories for processing symbolic sequential inputs. They are easy to organize and train. In this paper, we demonstrate that a motivated agent with semantic memory learns to achieve its goals more easily and utilizes environmental resources more effectively. To simplify comparisons with reinforcement learning, we represent the environment as an environmental graph that shows the principles governing it. By exploring the environment, the agent learns these principles and can use them to accomplish its tasks. Our experiments and tests confirm our claims about the higher efficiency of agents with memory. Moreover, an extensive comparison with reinforcement learning agents highlights the advantages of motivated learning over reinforcement learning.

 ##MORE##Unsupervised Video Anomaly Detection (UVAD) utilizes completely unlabeled videos for training without any human intervention. Due to the existence of unlabeled abnormal videos in the training data, the performance of UVAD has a large gap compared with semi-supervised VAD, which only uses normal videos for training. To address the problem of insufficient ability of the existing UVAD methods to learn normality and reduce the negative impact of abnormal events, this paper proposes a novel Enhanced Spatio-temporal Self-selective Learning (ESSL) framework for UVAD. This framework is designed for capturing both the appearance and motion features through effective network structures by solving the spatial and temporal jigsaw puzzles. Specially, we develop a Self-selective Learning Module (SLM) for UVAD, which prevents the model learning abnormal features and enhances the model by selecting normal features. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed method not only surpasses the state-of-the-art UVAD works, but also achieves the performance comparable to the classic semi-supervised methods for video anomaly detection that needs normal videos selected manually.

 ##MORE##Plan verification is the task of deciding whether a given plan is a solution to a planning problem. In this paper, we study the plan verification problem in the context of Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning, which has been proved to be NP-complete when partial order (PO) is involved. We will develop a novel SAT-based approach exploiting the data structures solution order graphs and path decomposition trees which encodes an HTN plan verification problem as a SAT one. We show in our experiments that this new approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) planning-based approach for verifying plans for POHTN problems.

 ##MORE##In various applications, ads are displayed together with prices, so as to provide a direct comparison among similar products or services. The price-displaying feature not only influences the consumers' decision, but also affects the bidding behavior of advertisers. In this paper, we study ad auctions with display prices from the perspective of mechanism design, in which advertisers are asked to submit both the product costs and the display prices of their commodities. We first provide a characterization for all individually rational and incentive-compatible mechanisms in the presence of display prices, then use it to design ad auctions in two scenarios. In the former scenario, the display prices are assumed to be exogenously determined. For this scenario, we derive the welfare-maximizing and revenue-maximizing auctions for any given display price profile. In the latter, advertisers are allowed to strategize their display prices freely. We investigate two families of allocation policies within the scenario and identify the equilibrium display prices accordingly. Our findings demonstrate the impact of display prices on the design of ad auctions, and highlight how platforms can utilize display price information to optimize the performance of ad delivery.

 ##MORE##Image geolocalization is receiving increasing attention due to its importance in several applications, such as image retrieval, criminal investigations and fact-checking. Previous works focused on several instances of image geolocalization including place recognition, GPS coordinates estimation and country recognition. In this paper, we tackle an even more challenging problem, which is recognizing the city where an image has been taken. Due to the vast number of cities in the world, we cast the problem as a verification problem, whereby the system has to decide whether a certain image has been taken in a given city or not. In particular, we present a system that given a query image and a small set of images taken in a target city, decides if the query image has been shot in the target city or not. To allow the system to handle the case of images, taken in cities that have not been used during training, we use a Siamese network based on Vision Transformer as a backbone. The experiments we run prove the validity of the proposed system which outperforms solutions based on state-of-the-art techniques, even in the challenging case of images shot in different cities of the same country.

 ##MORE##Visual question answering (VQA) is a crucial yet challenging task in multimodal understanding. To correctly answer questions about an image, VQA models are required to comprehend the fine-grained semantics of both the image and the question. Recent advances have shown that both grid and region features contribute to improving the VQA performance, while grid features surprisingly outperform region features. However, grid features will inevitably induce visual semantic noise due to fine granularity. Besides, the ignorance of geometric relationships makes VQA models difficult to understand the object relative positions in the image and answer questions accurately. In this paper, we propose a visual enhancement network for VQA that leverages region features and position information to enhance grid features, thus generating richer visual grid semantics. First, the grid enhancement multi-head guided attention module utilizes regions around the grid to provide visual context, forming rich visual grid semantics and effectively compensating for the fine granularity of the grid. Second, a novel geometric perception multi-head self-attention is introduced to process two types of features, incorporating geometric relations such as relative direction between objects while exploring internal semantic interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain competitive results over other strong baselines.

 ##MORE##Cost partitioning is the foundation of today's strongest heuristics for optimal classical planning. However, computing a cost partitioning for each evaluated state is prohibitively expensive in practice. Thus, existing approaches make an approximation and compute a cost partitioning only for a set of sampled states, and then reuse the resulting heuristics for all other states evaluated during the search. In this paper, we present exact methods for cost partitioning heuristics based on linear programming that fully preserve heuristic accuracy while minimizing computational cost. Specifically, we focus on saturated post-hoc optimization and establish several sufficient conditions for when reusing a cost partitioning computed for one state is optimal for other states, mainly based on a sensitivity analysis of the underlying linear program formulation. Our experiments demonstrate that our theoretical results transfer into practice and that our exact cost partitioning algorithms are competitive with the strongest approximations currently available while needing fewer linear program evaluations.

 ##MORE##Zero-shot Learning is the process of transferring knowledge (Cross-modal mapping relationship) of the seen classes to unseen classes. However, the realization of this knowledge transfer process relies on a large number of expensive labels. Even if the model has labels, Zero-shot learning also has the phenomenon of 'negative causality' in the process of Cross-modal alignment. In this paper, We propose an unsupervised learning model and leverage a counterfactual causal inference framework for cross-modal mapping relationship adjustment (CMRA). Specifically, we aim to regard images as cause and Wikipedia text as effect form a causal relationship diagram. First, it uses multiple attributes attention to learn images semantic attributes and corresponding Wikipedia text description word to form Cross-modal alignment. Then, using contrastive learning and stop-gradient are combined to form a new Cross-modal mapping relationship. Finally, we compare whether multiple attributes attention has consistency in the distribution of semantic attributes learned before and after image transformation and the attentions with larger distributions are eliminated using an inactivation strategy. This model evaluates the classification accuracy in AWA, CUB, APY, SUN. The experimental results show that the algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms technology approaches.

 ##MORE##Transfer learning in Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been widely studied to overcome training challenges in Deep-RL, i.e., exploration cost, data availability and convergence time, by bootstrapping external knowledge to enhance learning phase. While this overcomes the training issues on a novice agent, a good understanding of the task by the expert agent is required for such a transfer to be effective. As an alternative, in this paper we propose Expert-Free Online Transfer Learning (EF-OnTL), an algorithm that enables expert-free real-time dynamic transfer learning in multi-agent system. No dedicated expert agent exists, and transfer source agent and knowledge to be transferred are dynamically selected at each transfer step based on agents’ performance and level of uncertainty. To improve uncertainty estimation, we also propose State Action Reward Next-State Random Network Distillation (sars-RND), an extension of RND that estimates uncertainty from RL agent-environment interaction. We demonstrate EF-OnTL effectiveness against a no-transfer scenario and state-of-the-art advice-based baselines, with and without expert agents, in three benchmark tasks: Cart-Pole, a grid-based Multi-Team Predator-Prey (MT-PP) and Half Field Offense (HFO). Our results show that EF-OnTL achieves overall comparable performance to that of advice-based approaches, while not requiring expert agents, external input, nor threshold tuning. EF-OnTL outperforms no-transfer with an improvement related to the complexity of the task addressed.

 ##MORE##The popularity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has soared due to their proficiency in encapsulating intricate connections among graphs by aggregating information from (the immediate) node neighbors. Nonetheless, when dealing with graphs displaying a high degree of heterophily, the GNN performance declines as the faraway nodes that are pertinent to the task at hand are ignored during node aggregation. To contend with the issue of integrating long-range neighbors that are relevant into the GNN node aggregation mechanism, this paper introduces a model called the Overlay Graph Neural Networks (OGN). OGN is inspired by P2P overlay networks, where the idea is to find neighbor peers (nodes) that, although not directly connected to a given node (a peer), are semantically similar and could favorably improve both query routing and query results. In the context of OGN, the network refers to the graph, and the message passing procedure executed by a GNN to aggregate node features represents the routing process. OGN networks are built by stacking one or more overlay layers, each taking as input the graph and a node feature matrix either available or derivable (e.g., by analyzing the graph’s structure). Each overlay layer combines base embeddings, learned by considering node features and short-range node neighbors, with overlay embeddings computed by projecting nodes with similar features close in an overlay space and then aggregating (overlay) neighbor nodes via a sliding window attention mechanism. Base and overlay embeddings are combined to capture nodes’ immediate and global context in a graph. We evaluate OGN in a node classification task using state-of-the-art benchmarks and show that the OGN model is competitive with the advantage of being easily portable to any existing GNN model.

 ##MORE##Graph Lottery Ticket (GLT), a combination of core subgraph and sparse subnetwork, has been proposed to mitigate the computational cost of deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on large input graphs while preserving original performance. However, the winning GLTs in exisiting studies are obtained by applying iterative magnitude-based pruning (IMP) without re-evaluating and re-considering the pruned information, which disregards the dynamic changes in the significance of edges/weights during graph/model structure pruning, and thus limits the appeal of the winning tickets. In this paper, we formulate a conjecture, i.e., existing overlooked valuable information in the pruned graph connections and model parameters which can be re-grouped into GLT to enhance the final performance. Specifically, we propose an adversarial complementary erasing (ACE) framework to explore the valuable information from the pruned components, thereby developing a more powerful GLT, referred to as the ACE-GLT. The main idea is to mine valuable information from pruned edges/weights after each round of IMP, and employ the ACE technique to refine the GLT processing. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that our ACE-GLT outperforms existing methods for searching GLT in diverse tasks. Our code will be made publicly available.

 ##MORE##As more decisions in our daily life become automated, the need to have machine learning algorithms that make fair decisions increases. In fair representation learning we are tasked with finding a suitable representation of the data in which a sensitive variable is censored. Recent work aims to learn fair representations through adversarial learning. With this paper, we build upon this work by introducing a novel algorithm, ALFR++, to learn adversarial fair representations independent of the downstream task that may be encountered (supervised or unsupervised). We introduce balanced error rate modulation, to stabilize the interaction between actor and adversary. We couple it with a recently introduced censoring technique called stacking, to learn strong censored representations within a restricted hypothesis space. Results show that our algorithm improves on previous work in both censoring and reconstruction, allowing us to create fairer data without knowing the task beforehand.

 ##MORE##With the growth of networks, promoting products through social networks has become an important problem. For auctions in social networks, items are needed to be sold to agents in a network, where each agent can bid and also diffuse the sale information to her neighbors. Thus, the agents' social relations are intervened with their bids in the auctions. In network auctions, the classical VCG mechanism fails to retain key properties. In order to better understand network auctions, in this paper, we characterize network auctions for the single-unit setting with respect to IR, WBB, IC, efficiency, and other properties. For example, we present sufficient conditions for mechanisms to be efficient and (weakly) incentive compatible. With the help of these properties and new concepts such as rewards, participation rewards, and so on, we show how to design efficient mechanisms to satisfy IC as much as possible, and IC mechanisms to maximize the revenue. Our results provide insights into understanding auctions in social networks.

 ##MORE##The learnware paradigm aims to construct a market of numerous well-performing machine learning models, which enables users to leverage these models to accomplish specific tasks without having to build models from scratch. Each learnware in the market is a model associated with a specification, representing the model's utility and enabling it to be identified according to future users' requirements. In the learnware paradigm, due to the vast and ever-increasing number of models in the market, a significant challenge is to identify helpful learnwares efficiently for a specific user task without leaking data privacy. However, existing identification methods require examining the whole market, which is computationally unaffordable in a large market. In this paper, we propose a new framework for identifying helpful learnwares without examining the whole market. Specifically, using the Reduced Kernel Mean Embedding (RKME) specification, we derive a novel learnware scoring criterion for assessing the helpfulness of a learnware, based on which we design an anchor-based framework to identify helpful learnwares by examining only a small portion of learnwares in the market. Theoretical analyses are provided for both the criterion and the anchor-based method. Empirical studies on market containing thousands of learnwares from real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

 ##MORE##Camouflaged object detection is a challenging task that aims to identify objects that are highly similar to their background. Due to the powerful noise-to-image denoising capability of denoising diffusion models, in this paper, we propose a diffusion-based framework for camouflaged object detection, termed diffCOD, a new framework that considers the camouflaged object segmentation task as a denoising diffusion process from noisy masks to object masks. Specifically, the object mask diffuses from the ground-truth masks to a random distribution, and the designed model learns to reverse this noising process. To strengthen the denoising learning, the input image prior is encoded and integrated into the denoising diffusion model to guide the diffusion process. Furthermore, we design an injection attention module (IAM) to interact conditional semantic features extracted from the image with the diffusion noise embedding via the cross-attention mechanism to enhance denoising learning. Extensive experiments on four widely used COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves favorable performance compared to the existing 11 state-of-the-art methods, especially in the detailed texture segmentation of camouflaged objects. Our code will be made publicly available later.

 ##MORE##Abusive language detection models tend to have a gender bias problem in which the model is biased towards sentences containing identity words of specific gender groups. Previous studies to reduce bias, such as projection methods, lose information in word vectors and sentence context, reducing detection accuracy. This paper proposes a bias mitigation method that optimizes gender bias mitigation and original information preservation by regularizing sentence embedding vectors based on information theory. Latent vectors generated by an autoencoder are debiased through dual regularization using a gender discriminator, an abuse classifier, and a decoder. While the gender discriminator labels are rumpled, the discriminator softens the gender feature, and the classifier retains the abuse information. Latent vectors are regularized through information theoretic adversarial optimization that disentangles and mitigates gender features. We show that the proposed method successfully orthogonalizes the direction of the correlated information and reduces the gender feature by calculation of subspaces and embedding vector visualization. Moreover, the proposed method maintains the highest accuracy among the four state-of-the-art bias mitigation methods and shows superior performance in reducing gender bias in four different Twitter datasets for abusive language detection.

 ##MORE##Research has shown that cooperative action struggles to emerge in the noisy variant of the donation game, a simple model of noisy multi-agent systems where indirect reciprocity is required to maximise utility. Such noise can arise when agents may have an incorrect view of the reputation of their interaction partners, or when the actions themselves may fail. Concepts such as generosity, as well as the use of higher-order norms, have been investigated as mechanisms to facilitate cooperation in such environments, but often are not effective or require additional assumptions or infrastructure in the system to operate. In this paper, we demonstrate both analytically and empirically that a simple form of generosity when combined with fine grained reputation can help cooperation emerge. We also show that the use of individual forgiveness strategies rather than the presence of global generosity can support cooperation in such environments.

 ##MORE##Implicit imitation assumes that learning agents observe only the state transitions of an agent they use as a mentor, and try to recreate them based on their own abilities and knowledge of their environment. In this paper, we put forward a deep implicit imitation Q-network (DIIQN) model, which incorporates ideas from three well-known Deep Q-Network (DQN) variants. As such, we enable a novel implicit imitation method for online, model-free deep reinforcement learning. Our thorough experimentation in the complex environment of the emerging lane-free traffic paradigm, verifies the benefits of our approach. Specifically, we show that deep implicit imitation RL dramatically accelerates the learning process when compared to a "vanilla" DQN method; and, unlike explicit imitation reinforcement learning, it is able to outperform mentor performance without resorting to additional information, such as the mentor's actions.

 ##MORE##We introduce Incomplete Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (iBAFs), the extension of Dung's Abstract Argumentation Frameworks (AAFs) allowing the simultaneous presence of supports (borrowed from BAFs - Bipolar AAFs) and of uncertain elements of the argumentation graph (borrowed from iAAFs - incomplete AAFs). We investigate the computational complexity of the acceptance problem and the verification problem (under the possible perspective), by performing an analysis of sensitivity to the semantics of supports and the semantics of extensions. On the one hand, we show that adding supports on top of incompleteness does not affect the complexity of the acceptance. On the other hand, surprisingly, we show that the joint use of bipolarity and incompleteness has a deep impact on the verification's complexity: for the Dungean semantics under which the verification over AAFs is polynomial-time solvable, although moving from AAFs to BAFs or to iAAFs does not change the complexity, the verification's complexity over iBAFs may increase up to NP-complete.

 ##MORE##Lexical simplification (LS) methods based on pretrained language models have made remarkable progress, generating potential substitutes for a complex word through analysis of its contextual surroundings. However, these methods require separate pretrained models for different languages and disregard the preservation of sentence meaning. In this paper, we propose a novel multilingual LS method via paraphrase generation, as paraphrases provide diversity in word selection while preserving the sentence's meaning. We regard paraphrasing as a zero-shot translation task within multilingual neural machine translation that supports hundreds of languages. After feeding the input sentence into the encoder of paraphrase modeling, we generate the substitutes based on a novel decoding strategy that concentrates solely on the lexical variations of the complex word. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpasses BERT-based methods and zero-shot GPT3-based method significantly on English, Spanish, and Portuguese.

 ##MORE##Supervised classification algorithms are used to solve a growing number of real-life problems around the globe. Their performance is strictly connected with the quality of labels used in training. Unfortunately, acquiring good-quality annotations for many tasks is infeasible or too expensive to be done in practice. To tackle this challenge, active learning algorithms are commonly employed to select only the most relevant data for labeling. However, this is possible only when the quality and quantity of labels acquired from experts are sufficient. Unfortunately, in many applications, a trade-off between annotating individual samples by multiple annotators to increase label quality vs. annotating new samples to increase the total number of labeled instances is necessary. In this paper, we address the issue of faulty data annotations in the context of active learning. In particular, we propose two novel annotation unification algorithms that utilize unlabeled parts of the sample space. The proposed methods require little to no intersection between samples annotated by different experts. Our experiments on four public datasets indicate the robustness and superiority of the proposed methods in both, the estimation of the annotator's reliability, and the assignment of actual labels, against the state-of-the-art algorithms and the simple majority voting.

 ##MORE##Federated learning breaks through the barrier of data owners by allowing them to collaboratively train a federated machine learning model without compromising the privacy of their own data. However, Federation Learning also faces the threat of poisoning attacks, especially from the client model updates, which may impair the accuracy of the global model. To defend against the poisoning attacks, previous work aims to identify the malicious updates in high dimensional spaces. However, we find that the distances in high dimensional spaces cannot identify the changes in a small subset of dimensions, and the small changes may affect the global models severely. Based on this finding, we propose an untargeted poisoning attack under the federated learning setting via the partial perturbations on a small subset of the carefully selected model parameters, and present two attack object selection strategies. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed attack scheme achieves high attack success rate on five state-of-the-art defense schemes. Furthermore, the proposed attack scheme remains effective at low malicious client ratios and still circumvents three defense schemes with a malicious client ratio as low as 2%.

 ##MORE##We study Linear Temporal Logic Modulo Theories over Finite Traces (LTLfMT), a recently introduced extension of LTL over finite traces (LTLf) where propositions are replaced by first-order formulas. In general, LTLfMT was shown to be semi-decidable for any decidable first-order theory (e.g., linear arithmetics), with a tableau-based semi-decision procedure. In this paper we focus on theories that satisfy the property of model completion, equivalent to the existence of uniform interpolants. This includes a variety of theories, including arithmetics, theories underlying database systems, and combinations thereof. We show that those theories admit a sound and complete pruning rule for the LTLfMT tableau that, when coupled with additional requirements, guarantees termination as well. This technique allows us to establish new decidability results for several fragments of LTLfMT, as well as to give new decidability proofs for classes that are already known.

 ##MORE##Neural networks (NNs) have various applications in AI, but explaining their decisions remains challenging. Existing approaches often focus on explaining how changing individual inputs affects NNs' outputs. However, an explanation that is consistent with the input-output behaviour of an NN is not necessarily faithful to the actual mechanics thereof. In this paper, we exploit relationships between multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and quantitative argumentation frameworks (QAFs) to create argumentative explanations for the mechanics of MLPs. Our SpArX method first sparsifies the MLP while maintaining as much of the original structure as possible. It then translates the sparse MLP into an equivalent QAF to shed light on the underlying decision process of the MLP, producing global and/or local explanations. We demonstrate experimentally that SpArX can give more faithful explanations than existing approaches, while simultaneously providing deeper insights into the actual reasoning process of MLPs.

 ##MORE##Dung’s Argumentation Framework (AF) has been extended in several directions. An interesting extension, among others, is the Epistemic AF (EAF) which allows representing the agent’s belief by means of epistemic constraints. In particular, an epistemic constraint is a propositional formula over labeled arguments (e.g. in(a), out(c)) extended with the modal operators K and M that intuitively state that the agent believes that a given formula is certainly or possibly true, respectively. In this paper, focusing on EAF, we investigate the complexity of the possible and necessary variants of three canonical problems in abstract argumentation: verification, existence, and non-empty existence. Moreover, we explore the relationship between EAF and incomplete AF (iAF), an extension of AF where arguments and attacks may be uncertain. Our complexity analysis shows that the verification problem in iAF can be naturally reduced to the verification in EAF, while it turns out that a similar result cannot hold for the necessary (non-empty) existence problem.

 ##MORE##The use of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) in multi-agent planning has led to a widely adopted action formalism that can handle nondeterminism, partial observability and arbitrary knowledge nesting. As such expressive power comes at the cost of undecidability, several decidable fragments have been isolated, mainly based on syntactic restrictions of the action formalism. In this paper, we pursue a novel semantic approach to achieve decidability. Namely, rather than imposing syntactical constraints, the semantic approach focuses on the axioms of the logic for epistemic planning. Specifically, we augment the logic of knowledge S5n and with an interaction axiom called (knowledge) commutativity, which controls the ability of agents to unboundedly reason on the knowledge of other agents. We then provide a threefold contribution. First, we show that the resulting epistemic planning problem is decidable. In doing so, we prove that our framework admits a finitary non-fixpoint characterization of common knowledge, which is of independent interest. Second, we study different generalizations of the commutativity axiom, with the goal of obtaining decidability for more expressive fragments of DEL. Finally, we show that two well-known epistemic planning systems based on action templates, when interpreted under the setting of knowledge, conform to the commutativity axiom, hence proving their decidability.

 ##MORE##Although current summarization models can process increasingly long text sequences, they still struggle to capture salient related information spread across the extremely-lengthy size of inputs with few labeled training instances. Today's research still relies on standard input truncation without considering graph-based modeling of multiple semantic units to summarize only crucial facets. This paper proposes G-Seek, a graph-based summarization of extracted essential knowledge. By representing the long source with a heterogeneous graph, our method extracts and provides salient sentences to an abstractive summarization model to generate the summary. Experimental results in low-resource scenarios, distinguished by data scarcity, reveal that G-Seek consistently improves both long and multi-document summarization performance and accuracy across several datasets.

 ##MORE##Our Collaborative Research Center (CRC) aims to enable robots to perform environmental interaction tasks with close to human capacity. It therefore employs a shared ontology to model the activity of both kinds of agents, empowering robots to learn from human experiences. To properly describe these human experiences, the ontology will strongly benefit from incorporating characteristics of neuronal information processing which are not accessible from a behavioral perspective alone. We, therefore, propose the analysis of human neuroimaging data for evaluation and validation of concepts and events defined in the ontology model underlying most of the CRC projects. In an exploratory analysis, we employed an Independent Component Analysis (ICA) on functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data from participants who were presented with the same complex video stimuli of activities as robotic and human agents in different environments and contexts. We then correlated the activity patterns of brain networks represented by derived components with timings of annotated event categories as defined by the ontology model. The present results demonstrate a subset of common networks with stable correlations and specificity towards particular event classes and groups, associated with environmental and contextual factors. These neuronal characteristics will open up avenues for adapting the ontology model to be more consistent with human information processing.

 ##MORE##Recent work demonstrated that path explanation redundancy is ubiquitous in decision trees, i.e. most often paths in decision trees include literals that are redundant for explaining a prediction. The implication of this result is that decision trees must be explained. Nevertheless, there are applications of DTs where running an explanation algorithm is impractical. For example, in settings that are time or power constrained, running software algorithms for explaining predictions would be undesirable. Although the explanations for paths in DTs do not generally represent themselves a decision tree, this paper shows that one can construct a decision set from some of the decision tree explanations, such that the decision set is not only explained, but it also exhibits a number of properties that are critical for replacing the original decision tree.

 ##MORE##In numeric AI planning, a state is represented by propositions and numeric variables, actions change the values of numeric variables in addition to adding and deleting propositions, and goals and preconditions of actions may include conditions over numeric variables. While domains of numeric variables are rational numbers in general, upper and lower bounds on variables affected only by constant increase and decrease can sometimes be determined and exploited by a heuristic function. In this paper, we generalize the existing method to variables that are changed by linear effects. We exploit the extracted bounds to improve the numeric LM-cut heuristic, a state-of-the-art admissible heuristic for linear numeric planning. Empirical evaluation shows that our method improves the performance of LM-cut in multiple domains. The proposed method can also detect unsolvability of some numeric tasks in polynomial time.

 ##MORE##Disjunctive scheduling problems such as the job shop and open shop are at the heart of many real world scheduling instances. In this paper, we frame such problems as disjunctive temporal networks associated with a makespan minimization objective. For those, we propose a hybrid approach between SMT and CP solvers. In particular, we keep from SMT solvers the aggregated constraint propagation in decision procedures as well as the explanations and clause learning mechanisms upon conflict. However, like all CP solvers, we maintain an explicit domain representation of integer variables, tightly integrated with clause learning. Automated search exploits explanations to derive activity-based heuristics combined with more classical value-based heuristics of CP solvers. The resulting solver is compared to state-of-the-art exhaustive search solvers on the classical benchmarks of job shop and open shop problems.

 ##MORE##Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn effective policies from recorded data without further interactions in the environments that are often costly or risky. Model-based algorithms, which begin by constructing an environmental model and then learn the policy under the model, have become a promising approach. However, most existing works have been over-conservative to avoid the out-of-distribution error induced by the model generated samples, leading to poor performance instead. In this work, we propose a novel model-based offline RL method, named Simple Double Validation (SDV). The main idea of SDV is to introduce an additional guidance model to assist the agent in determining the rationality of the states, combined with an advantage weighting factor to avoid effects that could potentially mislead the models due to suboptimal samples. In this way, the agent can be guided to more favourable states with reliable decisions. We evaluated SDV on the widely studied offline RL benchmarks and demonstrated its state-of-the-art performance. At the same time, our work introduces the idea of double validation and model advantage weighting into the field of model-based offline RL, providing new insights for future research.

 ##MORE##Modern recommender systems utilize users' historical behaviors to generate personalized recommendations. However, these systems often lack user controllability, leading to diminished user satisfaction and trust in the systems. Acknowledging the recent advancements in explainable recommender systems that enhance users' understanding of recommendation mechanisms, we propose leveraging these advancements to improve user controllability. In this paper, we present a user-controllable recommender system that seamlessly integrates explainability and controllability within a unified framework. By providing both retrospective and prospective explanations through counterfactual reasoning, users can customize their control over the system by interacting with these explanations. Furthermore, we introduce and assess two attributes of controllability in recommendation systems: controllability complexity and controllability accuracy. Experimental evaluations on MovieLens and Yelp datasets substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that offering users control options can potentially enhance recommendation accuracy in the future.

 ##MORE##There have been a number of attempts to develop a formal definition of causality that accords with our intuitions about what constitutes a cause. Perhaps the best known is the "modified'' definition of actual causality, HPm, due to Halpern. In this paper, we argue that HPm gives counterintuitive results for some simple causal models. We propose Dynamic Causality (DC), an alternative semantics for causal models that leads to an alternative definition of causes. DC ascribes the same causes as HPm on the examples of causal models widely discussed in the literature and ascribes intuitive causes for the kinds of causal models we consider. Moreover, we show that the complexity of determining a cause under the DC definition is lower than for the HPm definition.

 ##MORE##Recently, there has been a growing interest in developing machine learning (ML) models that can promote fairness, i.e., eliminating biased predictions towards certain populations (e.g., individuals from a specific demographic group). Most existing works learn such models based on well-designed fairness constraints in optimization. Nevertheless, in many practical ML tasks, only very few labeled data samples can be collected, which can lead to inferior fairness performance. This is because existing fairness constraints are designed to restrict the prediction disparity among different sensitive groups, but with few samples, it becomes difficult to accurately measure the disparity, thus rendering ineffective fairness optimization. In this paper, we define the fairness-aware learning task with limited training samples as the fair few-shot learning problem. To deal with this problem, we devise a novel framework that accumulates fairness-aware knowledge across different meta-training tasks and then generalizes the learned knowledge to meta-test tasks via fairness adaptation. To compensate for insufficient training samples, we propose an essential strategy to select and leverage an auxiliary set for each meta-test task. These auxiliary sets contain several labeled training samples that can enhance fairness adaptation in meta-test tasks, thereby allowing for the transfer of learned useful fairness-oriented knowledge to meta-test tasks. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets to validate the superiority of our framework against the state-of-the-art baselines.

 ##MORE##Recent studies show that an ensemble of deep networks can have better adversarial robustness by increasing the learning diversity of base models to limit adversarial transferability. However, existing schemes mostly rely on a second-order method for gradient regularization which usually involves a heavy computation overhead. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method which eliminates the use of a second-order optimization and significantly reduces the computation complexity of regularized simultaneous training of deep ensemble networks. For the first time, we show analytically that stochastic regularization by the proposed approach can promote both model smoothness and feature diversity of representation learning in the deep space. We also show that the proposed method is able to achieve a better gain of certified robustness. This is due to the effect of a prioritized feature selection enabled by an adaptive and continuous sampling of neuron activation among the base networks. Experimental results show that our method can improve adversarial robustness signiﬁcantly comparing with the existing ensemble models on several image benchmark datasets. The ensemble performance can be further boosted by complementing the stochastic regularization approach with other defense paradigms such as adversarial training.

 ##MORE##This research proposes an interpretable and practical solution for learning the causal relationship between a desired treatment and its outcome from observed data. This is crucial to assist decision-makers in various fields. However, in real-world scenarios, learning causal relationships from observed data is difficult due to confounding factors that influence treatment and outcome, and are not reported for all treatments, a problem known as Selective Confounding. This issue is prevalent in child welfare, where caseworkers determine whether children should remain in their family homes or be assigned out-of-home placements like foster care during child maltreatment assessments. In such cases, factors reported for children kept with their family are often lower than those taken out of home, making it difficult to observe all confounding factors under desired treatment. Our proposed scheme uses dual-treatment samples to identify the target quantity under Selective Confounding and adapts two-step procedures to learn counterfactual predictors such as Regression Adjustment or Doubly-Robust. We provide both theoretical error bounds and empirical evidence of the effectiveness of our proposed scheme using synthetic and real-world child placement data. Additionally, we propose three evaluation methods specifically tailored to child placement data. By promoting transparency and interpretability, we aim to provide a valuable tool for decision-makers.

 ##MORE##The use of multi-queue heuristic search and tie-breaking strategies has shown to be very effective for satisficing planning in the Classical Planning setting. However, to the best of our knowledge, the use of such techniques has never been studied and employed in heuristic search algorithms for Fully Observable Non-Deterministic (FOND) Planning. In this paper, we adapt existing satisficing techniques for scaling-up an AND/OR heuristic search algorithm for FOND Planning. Namely, we employ multi-queue heuristic search, dead-end detection, and tie-breaking strategies in LAO* for improving the extraction of strong-cyclic policies. We assess the efficiency of our alternative techniques in LAO* through an extensive ablation study over two different FOND Planning benchmarks. Empirical results show that our techniques improve the performance of LAO* in terms of coverage, expanded nodes, and planning time compared to a well-known planner based on vanilla LAO*. Indeed, the best configuration of our techniques is competitive with the current state-of-the-art in FOND Planning.

 ##MORE##Although machine learning models achieve high classification accuracy against benign samples, they are vulnerable to adversarial machine learning (AML) attacks which generate adversarial samples by adding well-crafted perturbations to the benign samples. The perturbations can be increased to enhance the attack success rate, however, if the perturbations are added without considering the semantic or perceptual similarity between the benign and adversarial samples, the attack can be easily perceived/detected. As such, there exists a trade-off between the attack success rate and the perceptual similarity. In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic-Preserving Adversarial Transformation (SPAT) framework which facilitates an advantageous trade-off between the two metrics. SPAT modifies the optimisation objective of an AML attack to include the goal of increasing the attack success rate as well as the goal of maintaining the perceptual similarity between benign and adversarial samples. Our experiments on a variety of datasets including CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and MNIST demonstrate that SPAT-transformed AML attacks achieve higher attack success rates than the conventional AML attacks while maintaining the same perceptual similarity.

 ##MORE##Counterfactual Explanations (cf-XAI) describe the smallest changes in feature values necessary to change an outcome from one class to another. However, presently many cf-XAI methods neglect the feasibility of those changes. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for presenting cf-XAI in natural language (Natural-XAI), giving careful consideration to actionable and comprehensible aspects while remaining cognizant of immutability and ethical concerns. We present three contributions to this endeavor. Firstly, through a user study, we identify two types of themes present in cf-XAI composed by humans: content-related, focusing on how features and their values are included from both the counterfactual and the query perspectives; and structure-related, focusing on the structure and terminology used for describing necessary value changes. Secondly, we introduce a feature actionability taxonomy with four clearly defined categories, each accompanied by an example, to streamline the explanation presentation process. Using insights from the user study and our taxonomy, we created a generalisable template-based natural language generation (NLG) method compatible with existing explainers like DICE, NICE, and DisCERN, to produce counterfactuals that address the aforementioned limitations of existing approaches. Finally, we conducted a second user study to assess the performance of our taxonomy-guided NLG templates on three domains. Our findings show that the taxonomy-guided Natural-XAI approach (n-XAI^T ) received higher user ratings across all dimensions, with significantly improved results in the majority of the domains assessed for articulation, acceptability, feasibility, and sensitivity dimensions.

 ##MORE##In peer review systems, reviewers are often asked to evaluate various features of submissions, such as technical quality or novelty. A score is given to each of the predefined features and based on these the reviewer has to provide an overall quantitative recommendation. It may be assumed that each reviewer has her own mapping from the set of features to a recommendation, and that different reviewers have different mappings in mind. This introduces an element of arbitrariness known as commensuration bias. In this paper we discuss a framework, introduced by Noothigattu, Shah and Procaccia, and then applied by the organizers of the AAAI 2022 conference. Noothigattu, Shah and Procaccia proposed to aggregate reviewer's mapping by minimizing certain loss functions, and studied axiomatic properties of this approach, in the sense of social choice theory. We challenge several of the results and assumptions used in their work and report a number of negative results. On the one hand, we study a trade-off between some of the axioms proposed and the ability of the method to properly capture agreements of the majority of reviewers. On the other hand, we show that dropping a certain unrealistic assumption has dramatic effects, including causing the method to be discontinuous.

 ##MORE##This paper paves the way for interpretable and configurable semantic similarity search, by training state-of-the-art models for identifying textual similarity guided by a set of aspects or dimensions. The similarity models are analyzed as to which interpretable dimensions of similarity they place the most emphasis on. We conceptually introduce configurable similarity search for finding documents similar in specific aspects but dissimilar in others. To evaluate the interpretability of these dimensions, we experiment with downstream retrieval tasks using weighted combinations of these dimensions. Configurable similarity search is an invaluable tool for exploring datasets and will certainly be helpful in many applied natural language processing research applications.

 ##MORE##Responsibility anticipation is the process of determining if the actions of an individual agent may cause it to be responsible for a particular outcome. This can be used in a multi-agent planning setting to allow agents to anticipate responsibility in the plans they consider. The planning setting in this paper includes partial information regarding the initial state and considers formulas in linear temporal logic as positive or negative outcomes to be attained or avoided. We firstly define attribution for notions of active, passive and contributive responsibility, and consider their epistemic variants. We then use these to define the notion of responsibility anticipation. We prove that our notions of anticipated responsibility can be used to coordinate agents in a planning setting and give complexity results for our model, including showing that anticipation and attribution for passive responsibility are equivalent to classical planning. We also present an outline for solving some of our attribution and anticipation problems using PDDL solvers.

 ##MORE##Answering temporal CQs over temporalized Description Logic knowledge bases (TKB) is a main technique to realize ontology-based situation recognition. In case the collected data in such a knowledge base is inaccurate, important query answers can be missed. In this paper we introduce the TKB Alignment problem, which computes a variant of the TKB that minimally changes the TKB, but entails the given temporal CQ and is in that sense (cost-)optimal. We investigate this problem for ALC TKBs and conjunctive queries with LTL operators and devise a solution technique to compute (cost-optimal) alignments of TKBs that extends techniques for the alignment problem for propositional LTL over finite traces.

 ##MORE##Agent Scheduling Problems (ASPs) are common in various real-world situations, requiring explainable decision-making processes to effectively allocate resources to multiple agents while fostering understanding and trust. To address this need, this paper presents a logic-based framework for providing explainable decisions in ASPs. Specifically, the framework addresses two types of queries: reason-seeking queries, which explain the reasoning behind scheduling decisions, and modification-seeking queries, which offer guidance on making infeasible decisions feasible. Acknowledging the importance of privacy in multi-agent scheduling, we introduce a privacy-loss function that measures the disclosure of private information in explanations, enabling a privacy-preserving aspect in our framework. By using this function, we introduce the notion of privacy-aware explanations and present an algorithm for computing them. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.

 ##MORE##This paper focuses on graphical models for modelling preferences in combinatorial space and their use for item optimization. The preferential optimization task seeks to find the preferred item that contains some defined values, which is useful for many recommendation settings found in e-commerce. We show that efficient (i.e., with polynomial time complexity) preferential optimization is achieved with a subset of cyclic CP-nets called conditional acyclic CP-net. We also introduce a new graphical preference model, called Conditional-Optimality networks (CO-networks), that are more succinct than conditional acyclic CP-nets and LP-trees but have the same expressiveness with respect to optimization. Finally, we show that preferential optimization can be used for encoding alternatives into partial instantiations, and vice versa, paving the way towards CO-nets and CP-nets unsupervised learning with the minimal description length (MDL) principle.

 ##MORE##Envy-freeness is one of the prominent fairness notions in fair multiagent resource allocation but it has been mainly studied from an individual point of view. When the agents are partitioned into groups, fairness between groups is desirable. Several notions of group envy-freeness have been proposed over the last few years in the domain of fair division. In this paper we show that when groups may have different sizes and each agent gets at most one item, existing group envy-freeness notions fail to satisfy some desirable axioms. This motivates us to propose an original notion of degree of envy-freeness among groups, based on the counterfactual comparison of sub-groups of the same size. While this notion is computationally demanding, we show that it can be efficiently approximated thanks to an adapted sampling method, thus showing that our approach can be of practical relevance.

 ##MORE##This paper introduces a novel pipeline for summarising timelines of events reported by multiple news sources. Transformerbased models for abstractive summarisation generate coherent and concise summaries of long documents but can fail to outperform established extractive methods on specialised tasks such as timeline summarisation (TLS). While extractive summaries are more faithful to their sources, they may be less readable and contain redundant or unnecessary information. This paper proposes a preference-based reinforcement learning (PBRL) method for adapting pretrained abstractive summarisers to TLS, which can overcome the drawbacks of extractive timeline summaries. We define a compound reward function that learns from keywords of interest and pairwise preference labels, which we use to fine-tune a pretrained abstractive summariser via offline reinforcement learning. We carry out both automated and human evaluation on three datasets, finding that our method outperforms a comparable extractive TLS method on two of the three benchmark datasets, and participants prefer our method’s summaries to those of both the extractive TLS method and the pretrained abstractive model. The method does not require expensive reference summaries and needs only a small number of preferences to align the generated summaries with human preferences.

 ##MORE##Continual learning (CL) is a challenging machine learning setting that is attracting the interest of an increasing number of researchers. Among recent CL works, architectural strategies appear particularly promising due to their potential to expand and adapt the model architecture as new tasks are presented. However, existing solutions do not efficiently exploit model sparsity due to the adoption of constant pruning ratios. Moreover, current approaches exhibit a tendency to quickly saturate model capacity since the number of weights is limited and each weight is restricted to a single value. In this paper, we propose Ada-QPacknet, a novel architectural CL method that resorts to adaptive pruning and quantization. These two features allow our model to overcome the two crucial issues of effective exploitation of model sparsity and efficient use of model capacity. Specifically, adaptive pruning restores model capacity by reducing the number of weights assigned to each task to a smaller subset of weights that preserves the performance of the full set, allowing other weights to be used for future tasks. Adaptive quantization separates each weight into multiple components with adaptively reduced bit-width, allowing a single weight to solve more than one task without significant performance drops, leading to improved exploitation of model capacity. Experimental results on benchmark CL scenarios show that our proposed method achieves better results in terms of accuracy than existing rehearsal, regularization, and architectural CL strategies. Moreover, our method significantly outperforms forget-free competitors in terms of efficient exploitation of model capacity.

 ##MORE##Symbolic knowledge-extraction (SKE) techniques are becoming of key importance for AI applications since they enable the explanation of opaque black-box predictors, enhancing trust and transparency. Among all the available SKE techniques, the best option for the case at hand should be selected. However, an automatic comparison between different options can be performed only if an adequate metric -- such as a scoring function resuming all the interesting features of the extractors -- is provided. The definition of evaluation metrics for symbolic knowledge extractors is currently neglected in the literature. Accordingly, in this paper we introduce the FiRe score metric to assess the quality of a symbolic knowledge-extraction procedure, taking into account both its predictive performance and the readability of the extracted knowledge. It is compared to another existing scoring metric and a rigorous mathematical formulation is provided along with several practical examples to highlight its effectiveness to the end of being exploited inside automatic hyper-parameter tuning procedures.

 ##MORE##Model-based diagnosis is a powerful, versatile and well-founded approach to troubleshooting a wealth of different types of systems. Diagnosis algorithms are both numerous and highly heterogeneous. In this work, we propose a taxonomy that allows their standardized assessment, classiﬁcation and comparison. The aim is to (i) give researchers and practitioners an impression of the diverse landscape of available techniques, (ii) allow them to easily retrieve and compare the main features as well as pros and cons, and (iii) facilitate the selection of the “right” algorithm to adopt for a particular problem case, e.g., in practical diagnostic settings, for comparison in experimental evaluations, or for reuse, modiﬁcation, extension, or improvement in the course of research. Finally, we demonstrate the value and application of the taxonomy by assessing and categorizing a range of more than 30 important diagnostic methods, and we point out how using the taxonomy as a common guideline for algorithm analysis would beneﬁt the research community in various regards.

 ##MORE##Centralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) presents itself as an ideal framework for aggregation companies (e.g., Uber, Lyft, Deliveroo) that have to take a sequential set of centralized decisions on assigning individual agents (typically resources like taxis, food delivery personnel) to customer requests online in the presence of demand uncertainty. However, centralized learning is especially challenging in such very large scale environments, with thousands of agents/resources and hundreds of thousands of requests coming in each day. In this paper, we provide a novel value decomposition mechanism that is able to tackle the scale and provide high quality (matching) decisions at each time step. We show that our value decomposition approach, Conditional Expectation

 ##MORE##Complex Event Recognition (CER) systems detect event occurrences in streaming input using predefined event patterns. Techniques that learn event patterns from data highly desirable in CER. Since such patterns are typically represented by symbolic automata, we propose a family of such automata where the transition-enabling conditions are defined by Answer Set Programming (ASP) rules, and which, thanks to the strong connections of ASP to symbolic learning, are learnable from data. We present such a learning approach in ASP, capable of jointly learning the structure of an automaton, while synthesizing the transition guards from building-block predicates, and a scalable, incremental version thereof that progressively revises models learnt from mini-batches using Monte Carlo Tree Search. We evaluate our approach on three CER datasets and empirically demonstrate its efficacy.

 ##MORE##Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful approach to training agents to perform tasks, but designing an appropriate reward mechanism is critical to its success. However, in many cases, the complexity of the learning objectives goes beyond the capabilities of the Markovian assumption, necessitating a more sophisticated reward mechanism. Reward machines and omega-regular languages are two formalisms used to express non-Markovian rewards for quantitative and qualitative objectives, respectively. This paper introduces omega-regular reward machines, which integrate reward machines with omega-regular languages to enable an expressive and effective reward mechanism for RL. We present a model-free RL algorithm to compute epsilon-optimal strategies against omega-regular reward machines and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through experiments.

 ##MORE##Supplying data augmentation to conversational question answering (CQA) can effectively improve model performance. However, there is less improvement from single-turn datasets in CQA due to the distribution gap between single-turn and multi-turn datasets. On the other hand, while numerous single-turn datasets are available, we have not utilized them effectively. To solve this problem, we propose a novel method to convert single-turn datasets to multi-turn datasets. The proposed method consists of three parts, namely, a QA pair Generator, a QA pair Reassembler, and a question Rewriter. Given a sample consisting of context and single-turn QA pairs, the Generator obtains candidate QA pairs and a knowledge graph based on the context. The Reassembler utilizes the knowledge graph to get sequential QA pairs, and the Rewriter rewrites questions from a conversational perspective to obtain a multi-turn dataset S2M. Our experiments show that our method can synthesize effective training resources for CQA. Notably, S2M ranks 1st place on the QuAC leaderboard1 at the time of submission (Aug 24th, 2022).

 ##MORE##Judgment summaries are beneficial for legal practitioners to comprehend and retrieve case law efficiently. Unlike summaries in general domains, e.g., news, judgment summaries often requires a clear structure. Such a structure helps readers grasp the information contained in the summary and reduces information loss. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing text summarizers can generate summaries aligned with the summary structure in the legal domain. Inspired by this observation, this paper introduces a Summary Structure-Enhanced (SSE) method to synthesize structured summaries for legal documents. SSE can easily be incorporated into the Encoder-Decoder framework, which is commonly adopted in state-of-the-art text summarizers. Experiments on the datasets of New Zealand and Chinese judgments show that the proposed method consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art summarizers in terms of Rouge scores.

 ##MORE##Offline reinforcement learning (RL) circumvents costly interactions with the environment by utilising historical trajectories. Incorporating a world model into this method could substantially enhance the transfer performance of various tasks without expensive calculations from scratch. However, due to the complexity arising from different types of generalisation, previous works have focused almost exclusively on single-environment tasks. In this study, we introduce a multi-environment offline RL setting to investigate whether a generalised world model can be learned from large, diverse datasets and serve as a good surrogate for policy learning in different tasks. Inspired by the success of multi-task prompt methods, we propose the Task-prompt Generalised World Model (TGW) framework, which demonstrates notable performance in this setting. TGW comprises three modules: a task-state prompter, a generalised dynamics module, and a reward module. We implement the generalised dynamics module as a transformer-based recurrent state-space model (TransRSSM) and employ prompts to provide task-specific instructions, enabling TGW to address the internal stochasticity of the generalised world model. On the MuJoCo control benchmarks, TGW significantly outperforms previous offline RL algorithms in multi-environment setting.

 ##MORE##Automatic radiology report generation is challenging as medical images or reports are usually similar to each other due to the common content of anatomy. This makes a model hard to capture the uniqueness of individual images and is prone to producing undesired generic or mismatched reports. This situation calls for learning more discriminative features that could capture even fine-grained mismatches between images and reports. To achieve this, this paper proposes a novel framework to learn discriminative image and report features by distinguishing them from their closest peers, i.e., hard negatives. Especially, to attain more discriminative features, we gradually raise the difficulty of such a learning task by creating increasingly hard negative reports for each image in the feature space during training, respectively. By treating the increasingly hard negatives as auxiliary variables, we formulate this process as a min-max alternating optimisation problem. At each iteration, conditioned on a given set of hard negative reports, image and report features are learned as usual by minimising the loss functions related to report generation. After that, a new set of harder negative reports will be created by maximising a loss reflecting image-report alignment. By solving this optimisation, we attain a model that can generate more specific and accurate reports. It is noteworthy that our framework enhances discriminative feature learning without introducing extra network weights. Also, in contrast to the existing way of generating hard negatives, our framework extends beyond the granularity of the dataset by generating harder samples out of the training set. Experimental study on benchmark datasets verifies the efficacy of our framework and shows that it can serve as a plug-in to readily improve existing medical report generation models.

 ##MORE##Federated Learning allows collaborative training without data sharing in settings where participants do not trust the central server and one another. Privacy can be further improved by ensuring that communication between the participants and the server is anonymized through a shuffle; decoupling the participant id from their data. This paper seeks to examine whether such a defense is adequate to guarantee anonymity, by proposing a novel fingerprinting attack over gradients sent by the participants to the server. We show that clustering of gradients can easily break the anonymization in an empirical study of learning federated language models on two language corpora. We then show that training with differential privacy can provide a practical defense against our fingerprint attack.

 ##MORE##Earley Parser is a top-down parser proposed for context-free grammars and used, for example, in the grammar constraint. Parsing trees of context-free grammars are very close to task decomposition trees used in hierarchical planning, specifically when the actions are totally ordered. This paper suggests using the Earley Parser to recognize totally ordered hierarchical plans. Given a sequence of actions - a prefix of the plan - and a task decomposition model, the plan recognition problem asks which task decomposes to a plan containing the given plan prefix. We will show that the Earley parser significantly increases the speed of plan recognition compared to the existing bottom-up parsing-based plan recognizer. The Earley parser's performance is also on a par with the planning-based plan recognizer despite not using any planning heuristics.

 ##MORE##Coordination and joint ability are important problems in representation and reasoning about multi-agent systems. Ghaderi et al. presented a formalization of joint ability of coalitions in the expressive first-order language of the situation calculus. Essentially, a coalition has joint ability to achieve a goal if after iterated elimination of dominated strategies, any remaining joint strategy achieves the goal. Based on their work, Liu et al. proposed JAADL, a modal logic for joint abilities under strategy commitments. In this paper, we propose EJAADL, an epistemic extension of JAADL, for imperfect information games where agents may have incomplete knowledge or even false beliefs about the world. Like Ghaderi et al.’s work, elimination of dominated strategies is now based on beliefs about the world, rather than facts about the world as in JAADL. Strategies are required to be uniform, i.e., they select the same action in all accessible histories. We illustrate EJAADL with examples, analyze its properties, and show that model checking memoryless EJAADL is in EXPTIME. Morover, we consider the fragment of memoryless EJAADL with only bounded number of elimination of dominated strategies, and show that the model checking problem for this fragment can be done in PSPACE.

 ##MORE##Knowledge-grounded dialogue (KGD) has become increasingly essential for online services, enabling individuals to obtain desired information. While KGD contains knowledge information, most knowledge points are fragmented and repeated in dialogues, making it difficult for users to quickly grasp complete and key information from a collection of sessions. In this paper, we propose a novel task of dialogue-grounded knowledge points generation (DialKPG) to condense a collection of sessions on a topic into succinct and complete knowledge points. To enable empirical study, we create TopicDial and OpenDial corpus based on two existing knowledge-grounded dialogue corpus FaithDial and OpenDialKG by a Three-Stage Annotation Framework, and establish a novel approach for DialKPG task, namely MSAM (Multi-Level Salience-Aware Mixture). MSAM explicitly incorporates salient information at the token-level, utterance-level, and session-level to better guide knowledge points generation. Extensive experiments have verified the effectiveness of our method over competitive baselines. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the proposed model is particularly effective at handling long inputs and multiple sessions due to its strong capability of duplicated elimination and knowledge integration.

 ##MORE##Motivated by the abundance of biomedical publications and the need to better understand the relationship between food and health, we study a new sentiment analysis task based on literature- based discovery. Many attempts have been made to introduce health into recipe recommendation systems and food analysis. However, these methods focus highly on ingredient nutritional components or use simple computational models trained on curated labeled data. With the high availability of food and health information in biomedical texts but with a high cost of data labeling, there is a need for enhanced models to capture the intrinsic relationship between food ingredients and biomedical concepts, including genes, diseases, nutrition, and chemicals. This model should also utilize both available labeled resources and unlabelled data. In this paper, we propose a new sentiment analysis task called Entity Relationship Sentiment Analysis (ERSA) that focuses on capturing the relationship between biomedical and food concepts. This task extends the popularly studied Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) task. Specifically, our study focuses on the sentiment analysis of (entity-entity) pairs given a biomedical text sentence. This task presents a more significant challenge than traditional sentiment analysis tasks, as the sentiment expressed in the sentence may not necessarily reflect the sentiment of the relationship between two given entities in the sentence. Furthermore, we propose a semi-supervised architecture that combines two different types of word embeddings to encode the ERSA task better. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms other semi-supervised learning methods across various learning scenarios.

 ##MORE##Advancements in Conversational Natural Language Processing (NLP) have the potential to address critical social challenges, particularly in achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal of quality education through the development of Virtual Tutors. However, the application of NLP in the educational domain, especially language learning, has been limited due to the inherent complexities of the field and the scarcity of available datasets. In this paper, we introduce T-VAKS (Tutoring Virtual Agent with Knowledge Selection), a novel language tutoring multimodal Virtual Agent (VA) designed to assist students in learning a new language. Our approach employs an information theory-based knowledge selection module built on top of a multimodal seq2seq generative model, facilitating the generation of appropriate, informative, and contextually relevant tutor responses. T-VAKS aims to bridge the gap between NLP and the educational domain, enabling more effective language tutoring through intelligent virtual agents. The knowledge selection module consists of two sub-modules: (i) knowledge relevance estimation, and (ii) knowledge focusing framework. We evaluate the performance of our proposed model against various baseline models and the most recent state-of-the-art models, using multiple evaluation metrics. The results demonstrate that T-VAKS outperforms competing models, highlighting the potential of our approach in enhancing language learning through the use of conversational NLP and virtual agents, ultimately addressing social challenges and promoting well-being.

 ##MORE##Crowd flow prediction is vital in various fields such as traffic management, public safety, and urban planning. The main challenge in crowd flow prediction lies in effectively modeling the periodic temporal dependency and long-range spatial dependency. In the temporal domain, crowd flow shows a strong periodicity which is exploited by existing works to build multi-time-scale spatial-temporal features. However, these works hardly consider the disturbance of periods, that is, the crowd flow is not strictly periodic. In the spatial domain, existing works mainly utilize CNN to capture spatial dependency, but the small receptive field of the convolution operator limits the ability to capture the long-range dependency between crowd flows in different regions. In this paper, we propose GridFormer, a Transformer network, in which a periodically shifted sampling method and attention mechanism are employed to handle the temporal shifting in the daily and weekly periodicity, and a pyramid 3D Swin Transformers network is designed to capture long-range spatial dependency in a hierarchical manner. Meanwhile, the pyramid 3D Swin Transformers network jointly models spatial-temporal features to enable better interaction between the spatial and temporal domains. Experimental results on three crowd flow datasets demonstrate that our GridFormer outperforms the state-of-the-art crowd flow prediction methods.

 ##MORE##Learning fair policies in reinforcement learning (RL) is important when the RL agent may impact many users. We investigate a variant of this problem where equity is still desired, but some users may be entitled to preferential treatment. In this paper, we formalize this more sophisticated fair optimization problem in deep RL using generalized fair social welfare functions (SWF), provide a theoretical discussion to justify our approach, explain how deep RL algorithms can be adapted to tackle it, and empirically validate our propositions on several domains. Our contributions are both theoretical and algorithmic, notably: (1) We obtain a general bound on the suboptimality gap in terms of SWF-optimality using average reward of a policy SWF-optimal for the discounted reward, which notably justifies using standard deep RL algorithms, even for the average reward; (2) Our algorithmic innovations include a state-augmented DQN-based method for learning either deterministic or stochastic policies, which also applies to the usual fair optimization setting without any preferential treatment.

 ##MORE##Gradual semantics are methods that evaluate overall strengths of individual arguments in graphs. In this paper, we investigate gradual semantics for extended frameworks in which probabilities are used to quantify the uncertainty about arguments and attacks belonging to the graph. We define the likelihoods of an argument's possible strengths when facing uncertainty about the topology of the argumentation framework. We also define an approach to compare the strengths of arguments in this probabilistic setting. Finally, we propose a method to calculate the overall strength of each argument in the framework, and we evaluate this method against a set of principles.

 ##MORE##In some applications, planning-monitoring systems generate plans and monitor their execution by other agents. During execution, agents might deviate from these plans for various reasons. The deviation from the expected behavior will be observed by the planning-monitoring system, which will replan in order to provide the agent a new suggested plan. Most existing replanning approaches maintain the goals and compute a plan that achieves them under  
  the new circumstances. This is often not realistic, as achieving the original goal might be very costly or impossible under the new circumstances. Furthermore, replanning approaches usually overlook agent’s behavior up to the observed deviation from the original plan. In this paper we introduce GREPLAN, a novel approach that proposes new replanning goals (and plans) by solving a multi-objective optimization problem that considers all goals within a perimeter of the original goal. Empirical results in several planning benchmarks show that GREPLAN successfully reacts to deviations from the original plan by generating new appropriate replanning goals.

 ##MORE##Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a well-known AI formalism. Traditional ASP systems, that follow the “ground&Solve” approach, are intrinsically limited by the so-called grounding bottleneck. Basically, the grounding step (i.e., variable-elimination) can be computationally expensive and even unfeasible in several cases of practical interest. Recent work demonstrated that the grounding bottleneck can be partially overcome by compiling in external propagators subprograms acting as constraints. In this paper a novel compilation technique is presented that can be applied to tight normal programs; thus, the class of ASP programs that can be compiled is extended beyond constraints. The approach is implemented in the new system ProASP. ProASP skips entirely the grounding phase, and performs solving by injecting custom propagators in GLUCOSE. An experiment conducted on ground-intensive ASP benchmarks shows that ProASP is capable of solving instances that are out of reach for state-of-the-art ASP systems
