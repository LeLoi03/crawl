The conference will provide an excellent opportunity for scientists and engineers to present and discuss the latest scientific results and methods. The conference will include keynote addresses, contributed papers, and numerous lectures and tutorials on a wide range of topics. The Conference will be held in the hybrid mode: online and on-site in Zakopane  . The authors of accepted papers will have a choice to present their papers on-line, or on site in Zakopane, Mercury Kasprowy Hotel, Poland.

The papers should be organized in accordance with a common scientific structure (abstract, state of the art in the field, intention, used methodology, obtained results and references). Papers will undergo double-blind reviewing by an international committee, and accepted on the basis of their scientific merit and relevance to the conference topics. Please prepare anonymized versions of the paper being submitted. Please preserve anonymity by avoiding providing information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgements, links to websites and the literature references. After the notification of acceptance, authors will be allowed to make a correction in accordance with the suggestions of the reviewers and submit final camera-ready papers in Latex format only. The conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence. Springer LNAI proceedings will be available online shortly after the conference.

 Beware of the Fake ICAISC Conference from WASET  
 We would like to bring to your attention the issue of fake conferences organized by WASET (World Academy of Science, Engineering, and Technology). It has come to our notice that WASET has a history of hosting dubious conferences that lack academic rigor and credibility. We advise you to thoroughly research any conference before committing to it and to consult with trusted colleagues or academic advisors if you have doubts. Please read more at:

 Submission  
 The conference proceedings will be published in the Springer-Verlag series "Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence", and we strongly recommend the use of the Springer LaTeX style. To ensure reasonable quality and consistency of preparation, it is important that authors adhere strictly to the instructions. Any manuscript submitted in technically unsuitable form will be returned to the author for retyping. Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines  and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for MS Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer’s proceedings LaTeX templates are also available in Overleaf  . Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs  in their (final) papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.  
 Every final paper must be accompanied by the copyright form, which we ask a corresponding author to complete and sign. The copyright form in PDF is located at the Springer web site  (Licence to Publish form for LNCS, CCIS or LNBIP). It is sufficient if one author of each contribution signs the form on behalf of all the other authors. the copyright form should be submitted during the final submission as a separate zipped pdf file. Please use the following data to fill the form:  
 All final submissions should be in a .zip compressed archive including:  
 the source (input) files, i.e. TeX source files for the text and figure files, 
  any style files, templates, and special fonts the authors may have used, 
  MS Word file in the case of using MS Word, 
  the final Postscript (.ps) or Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) file, 
  the scanned completed and signed copyright form. 
 By submitting the paper to the ICAISC conference the author(s) agree that they did not submit this paper to any other conference and one of them will attend the conference to present the paper.  
  Please note that all papers will be assigned a paper number. You will receive this number after you have completed the paper submission process. Authors are then required to use the paper number assigned to them for all future correspondence regarding this paper.

 EATCS International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP)  
 ICALP’s scientific program is split into two parts: Track A of the meeting corresponds to Algorithms, Complexity, and Games, and Track B to Automata, Logic, Semantics, and Theory of Programming. Typical topics are: algorithmic aspects of network economics, approximation and online algorithms, automata theory, combinatorial optimisation, computational complexity, design and analysis of algorithms, formal aspects of security, foundations of databases, games and logic, logic and semantics of programs, mathematical aspects of programming, models of concurrent, reactive and stochastic systems, networked computation, parallel and distributed computing, quantum computing, randomness in computing, type systems, verification and synthesis.  
 EATCS presents annually the Best EATCS Paper Award  , the Best Student  and best ICALP Paper  Awards, all awarded at ICALP. Jointly with ACM SIGLOG, EACSL and the Kurt Goedel Society, EATCS presents the Alonzo Church award. Jointly with ACM SIGACT, EATCS awards the Gödel Prize for outstanding papers in the area of theoretical computer science. The award ceremony takes place alternately at ICALP and STOC.

 Submission guidelines   
 Papers must present original research on the theory of computer science. No prior publication and no simultaneous submission to other publication outlets (either a conference or a journal) is allowed. Authors are encouraged to also make full versions of their submissions freely accessible in an on-line repository such as ArXiv, HAL, ECCC.  
 Submissions take the form of an extended abstract of no more than 15 pages, excluding references and a clearly labelled appendix. The appendix may consist either of omitted proofs or of a full version of the submission, and it will be read at the discretion of program committee members. The extended abstract has to present the merits of the paper and its main contributions clearly, and describe the key concepts and technical ideas used to obtain the results. Submissions must provide the proofs which can enable the main mathematical claims of the paper to be fully verified.  
 Submissions are anonymous. The conference will employ a fairly lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work are in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”).  
 The purpose of this double-blind process is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, and not to make it impossible for them to discover who the authors are if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas.  
 The submissions are done via Easychair to the appropriate track of the conference (see topics below). The use of pdflatex and the LIPIcs style are mandatory: papers that deviate significantly from the required format risk rejection without consideration of merit.  
 During the rebuttal phase, authors will have from March 22-25 to view and respond to initial reviews. Further instructions will be sent to authors of submitted papers before that time.  
 At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for the conference, and all talks are in-person. In exceptional cases, there may be support for remotely presenting a talk.  
 Papers authored only by students should be marked as such upon submission in order to be eligible for the best student paper awards of the track.
