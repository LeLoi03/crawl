 Onward! 2024  
 Pasadena, California, USA, October 23-25, 2024 
  Co-located with SPLASH 2024 
  Papers chair: Jonathan Edwards (unaffiliated) 
  Citation: This paper revitalized the study of live programming, introducing mechanisms that are now standard techniques in the field. The paper epitomizes the spirit of Onward!, asking risky questions outside the current discourse. In its form the paper was a breath of fresh air, enlivened by the use of comic strips. The work marked the beginning of a rich seam of research that has been productively mined at the ongoing LIVE workshop series at SPLASH.

 About

  Call for Papers 
  Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.  
 The Character of Onward!   
 Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.

 Selection Process   
 Onward! papers are peer-reviewed in a double blind manner. Accepted papers will appear in the Onward! Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Submissions will be judged on the potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation.  
 Onward! Papers follows a two-phase review process. This enables us to welcome papers that contain promising ideas and have the potential to meet the conference’s standards, but which may fall short of this in the initial submission. At the end of the first phase, all papers will be either: accepted normally; or asked to perform certain required revisions; or rejected outright. The authors of papers asked to perform revisions will get one month to complete the revisions, at which point the original reviewers decide on the final acceptance of the paper. All papers will thus remain under submission until the authors receive notification of acceptance or rejection.  
 We expect the typical strong submission to be accepted normally, with authors expected—as is conventional—to revise the paper using the program committee’s feedback.  
 The program committee may identify certain papers with promising ideas as needing important revisions. These papers will be handled in one of two ways. They may be assigned a shepherd, in the tradition followed by numerous conferences. Otherwise, they will be given a concrete set of goals to accomplish in the revision. In the latter case, the second submission must then be accompanied by a cover letter mapping the revision requests to specific parts of the paper; the program committee will use the cover letter and revised submission to arrive at a final decision.  
 The second phase will only be used to elevate promising papers to the conference’s standard, not to require additional work of papers already deemed up-to-standard.  
 Instructions for Authors   
 For fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the formatting instructions (see below). Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the Program Chair.  
 Submission Site   
 Concurrent Submissions   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism.  
 Policy on Double Blind Review   
 Onward! 2023 is using a double-blind submission process. This means that authors will not know who reviewed their papers, and reviewers will not know who authored the papers they review. The aim of double-blind is to treat all papers with minimal bias. Authors must take the following actions to prepare their papers for double-blind reviewing:  
 Remove identifying information (names, institutions, etc) from the author block of the first page of the paper. 
  To the extent possible, when authors cite their own work, they should refer to it in the third person. 
  To the extent possible, authors should remove any other potentially identifying information, such as acknowledgements. 
  After submitting their review, reviewers will be able to see author identities. When the paper is accepted for publication, the camera-ready copy must not be blinded.  
 See OOPSLA’s FAQ on double-blind reviewing for more information. Please contact the PC chair if you have any questions.  
 Policy on Authorship Changes   
 Any addition of authors after initial submission of a paper must be cleared with the PC chair. Authors are very strongly advised to list all authors prior to initial submission as the addition of authors may create new conflicts with the PC. In all cases, the PC chair must be provided with a rationale. The PC chair has the authority to reject any requested change.  
 Format   
 Submissions should use ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart Format, sigplan sub-format  and 10 point font. All submissions should be in PDF format.  
 If you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you will need to use the sigplan, anonymous and review options. Note that by default the SIGPLAN template produces two-column, 9 point papers, but you will need to you will need to set the 10pt option in the \documentclass command. If you are formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word template that supports this font size. Please include page numbers in your submission. Setting the review option in the LaTeX \documentclass command generates page numbers, and the anonymous option hides author names. Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.  
 Page Limit   
 To ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, the main part of the paper (excluding bibliographic references) should be no longer than 13 pages. There is no page limit for bibliographic references and appendices, and, therefore, for the overall submission. However, reviewers are not obligated to read the appendices, so the main part of the paper should be self contained. If the paper is accepted, the final submission will be limited to 17 pages. (The 13-page limit for the main body of the paper no longer applies.)  
 Publication (Digital Library Early Access Warning)   
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

 Call for Papers  
 The OOPSLA issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (PACMPL) welcomes papers focusing on all practical and theoretical investigations of programming languages, systems and environments. Papers may target any stage of software development, including requirements, modeling, prototyping, design, implementation, generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance, and reuse of software systems. Contributions may include the development of new tools, techniques, principles, and evaluations.  
 OOPSLA 2023 will have two | separate | rounds of reviewing, with | Round 1 submission deadline: October 28, 2022 and and Round 2 submission deadline: April 14, 2023 
  In each round, papers will have a final outcome of Accept, Revise, or Reject—see Review Process for details. 
 Review Process   
 PACMPL(OOPSLA) has two rounds  of reviewing. The final outcome of each round can be one of Accept, Revise or Reject.  
 Each round  of reviewing consists of two phases  . The first phase evaluates the papers and results in an early notification of Reject, Revise, or Conditional Accept. During the first phase, authors will be able to read their reviews and respond to them. The second phase is restricted to conditionally accepted papers. Authors must make a set of mandatory revisions. The second phase assesses whether the required revisions have been addressed. The outcome can be Accept, Revise or Reject.  
 Submissions   
 PACMPL uses double-blind reviewing. Authors’ identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted. Papers must  
 omit author names and institutions, 
  use the third person when referencing your work, 
  anonymise supplementary material. 
  Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission; see the DBR FAQ. When in doubt, contact the Review Committee Chairs.  
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy  . Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism  . Submissions are expected to comply with the ACM Policies for Authorship  .  
 Artifacts   
 Authors should indicate with their initial submission if an artifact exists, describe its nature and limitations, and indicate if it will be submitted for evaluation. Accepted papers that fail to provide an artifact will be requested to explain the reason they cannot support replication. It is understood that some papers have no artifacts.  
 Publication   
 Selection Criteria   
 We consider the following criteria when evaluating papers:  
 Novelty:  The paper presents new ideas and results and places them appropriately within the context established by previous research.  
 Importance:  The paper contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the field. We also welcome papers that diverge from the dominant trajectory of the field.  
 Evidence:  The paper presents sufficient evidence supporting its claims, such as proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, case studies, and anecdotes.  
 Clarity:  The paper presents its contributions, methodology and results clearly.  
 Artifacts   
 Q: Are artifacts required?   
 No! It is understood that some papers have no artifacts. But if an artifact is not provided when the claims in the paper refer to an artifact, the authors must explain why their work is not available for repetition.  
 Q: Can a paper be accepted if the artifact is rejected?   
 Yes! The reasons for rejecting an artifact are multiple and often stem from the quality of the packaging.  
 Double-Blinding Submissions (Authors)   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 Q: Should I change the name of my system?   
 No.  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?   
 Cite the code in your paper, but remove the URL and, instead say “link to repository removed for double blind review”. If you believe reviewer access to your code would help during author response, contact the Review Committee Chairs.  
 Q: I am submitting an extension of my workshop paper, should I anonymize reference to that work?   
 No. But we recommend you do not use the same title, so that it is clearly distinguishes the papers.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my paper on my web page or arXiv? send it to colleagues? give a talk about it? on social media?   
 We have developed guidelines to help navigate the tension between the normal communication of scientific results and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of authors. Roughly speaking, you may discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are gray areas and trade-offs. Things you may do:  
 Put your submission on your home page. 
  Discuss your work with anyone not on the review committees or reviewers with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. 
  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on arXiv or a similar site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-blind reviewing, etc. 
  Things you should not do:  
 Contact members of the review committee about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. 
  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, OOPSLA paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternately, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. 
  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Review Committee Chairs.

 Object-oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications (OOPSLA)  
  OOPSLA (Object-oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications) is now part of SPLASH (Systems, Programming Languages, and Applications: Software for Humanity).  
 The SPLASH Steering Committee  serves as the OOPSLA Steering Committee.  
 The scope of OOPSLA includes all aspects of programming languages and software engineering, broadly construed. Papers that address any aspect of software development are welcome, including requirements, modeling, prototyping, design, implementation, generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance, reuse, replacement, and retirement of software systems. Papers may address these topics in a variety of ways, including new tools (such as languages, program analyses, and runtime systems), new techniques (such as methodologies, design processes, code organization approaches, and management techniques), and new evaluations (such as formalisms and proofs, corpora analyses, user studies, and surveys).  
 Most Influential OOPSLA Paper Award  Each year a “Most Influential” OOPSLA paper is chosen and an presentation is made at OOPSLA. More details about this award and past winning papers can be found here  . SIGPLAN also makes several other awards including an “Outstanding Dissertation Award.” Please consider making a nomination for one of these awards. More details about the SIGPLAN awards can be found here  .

 Title:  The Classification and Potential of Business Archetypes by Using Open Data  
 Authors:  Run Duan (Guangdong University of Technology), Tetsuo Noda (Shimane University)  
 Abstract:  Public data collected or possessed by administrative agencies and subsequently released as Open Data is expected to bring about positive economic effects. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the business archetypes of using Open Data to establish whether this expectation holds true, and to classify Open Data business archetypes into 7 types to predict their commercial potential.

 About OPODIS 2023  
 OPODIS is an open forum for the exchange of state-of-the-art knowledge concerning distributed computing and distributed computer systems. All aspects of distributed systems are within the scope of OPODIS, including theory, specification, design, performance, and system building. With strong roots in the theory of distributed systems, OPODIS now covers the whole range between the theoretical aspects and practical implementations of distributed systems, as well as experimentation and quantitative assessments.

  OPODIS 23 takes place in West Area, Building 9  , Multi-Purpose Digital Hall  . The reception (Dec. 5) is at Tokyo Tech Front  , Royal Blue Hall. MAC 23  (Dec. 9-10) is organized in West Area, Building 8E  , 10th floor, Conference Hall.  
 Most attendants will arrive from Ookayama station  (Meguro line, Oimachi line) and enter the campus via the Main Gate  . Those coming from Midorigaoka station (Oimachi line) will come via South exit, through the bicycle parking and enter the campus via the Midorigaoka Gate  .  
  Hotels  
 Tokyo offers a large variety of accommodations for all budgets and preferences. We recommend booking a hotel close to one of the stops on the Meguro line, Oimachi line, Ikegami line, or Toyoko line. Areas convenient for commuting to the venue are near the following stations: Oimachi Meguro Jiyugaoka, Musashi-Kosugi  , Futako-Tamagawa. Other alternatives include: Shibuya Ebisu Shinagawa Gotanda JR Kamata.  
  The top recommendation is Meguro Station as this runs against the flow of the morning rush hour. Besides, the OPODIS banquet will be located near Meguro station
