 Conference theme:  The BCS Human-Computer Interaction Conference 2023 was co-located with the INTERACT 2023 conference, the theme of which was "Design for Equlity and Justice", as increasingly, computer science as a discipline is becoming concerned about issues of justice and equality – from fake news to rights for robots, from the ethics of driverless vehicles to the gamergate controversy. The BCS HCI Conference welcomed submissions on all aspects of human-computer interaction. Topics included: User Experience, usability testing and interaction design; Education and Health; Smart Energy, Smart Transport and the Internet of Things; Interaction Technologies and Applications.

  Introduction  
 The British HCI Conference again attracted papers on a wide and interesting range of topics in HCI from ones of long standing importance in the field, such as evaluating interfaces (for example, the paper by Theodor Fahlén, Taufik Akbar Sitompul and Rikard Lindell on Evaluating Graphical User Interfaces for Handling Latency in Remote Crane Operation  ) to topics which have only recently come to the fore (for example the paper by Freya Smith, Malak Sadek and Céline Mougenot on Empowering End-users in Co-Designing AI  ). In addition, although this is the British HCI Conference, it also brought together papers from a range of other countries including China, Iceland, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA.

 The Eleventh AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing  
  November 6–9, 2023  Delft, Netherlands  @hcomp_conf  – #HCOMP2023   
 Welcome to HCOMP 2023!  
 The 11th AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing (HCOMP 2023) will be held November 6-10th at Delft University of Technology as a joint conference with the CI2023-ACM Collective Intelligence Series.  
 HCOMP is the premier venue for disseminating the latest research findings on human computation and crowdsourcing. While artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction (HCI) represent traditional mainstays of the conference, HCOMP believes strongly in fostering and promoting broad, interdisciplinary research. Our field is particularly unique in the diversity of disciplines it draws upon and contributes to including human-centered qualitative studies and HCI design, social computing, artificial intelligence economics, computational social science, digital humanities, policy, and ethics. We promote the exchange of advances in human computation and crowdsourcing not only among researchers but also engineers and practitioners to encourage dialogue across disciplines and communities of practice.

 HCW 2023  
 The thirty-second Heterogeneity in Computing Workshop ( HCW  ) was held at the Hilton St. Petersburg Bayfront Hotel, St. Petersburg, Florida, on May 15, 2023  . HCW is annually organized in conjunction with the International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium ( IPDPS  ).  
 HCW 2023 Program   
 HCW 2023 Call for Papers   
 Heterogeneous computing systems comprise growing numbers of increasingly more diverse computing resources that can be local to one another or geographically distributed. The opportunity and need for effectively utilizing heterogeneous computing resources has given rise to the notions of cluster computing, grid computing, and cloud computing. HCW encourages paper submissions from both the research and industry communities presenting novel ideas on theoretical and practical aspects of computing in heterogeneous computing environments.  
 St. Petersburg, Florida    
 HCW 2023 Program   
 Session Chairs  : Behrooz Shirazi (Washington State University, US) and Jan Christian Meyer (Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NO)  
 Peter Kogge  , the Ted H. McCourtney Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame, delivered the HCW 2023 keynote.  
 Title  : Heterogeneity and the Problem that Shall Not Be Named   
 Abstract  : Heterogeneity is clearly increasing, especially as “accelerators” burrow deeper and deeper into different parts of an architecture. What is new, however, is a rapid change in not only the number of such heterogeneous cores, but in their characteristics, such as ISA or memory architecture. This talk is focused on the problem of how to construct efficient programs that combine multiple heterogeneous concurrent threads. We focus on the need today to invoke significant software stacks to cross any of these new boundaries. A suggestion is made of using migrating threads as the glue.  
  Panel Moderator  : H. J. Siegel (Colorado State University, US)  
  Panelists  : David Bader (New Jersey Institute of Technology, US), Taisuke Boku (University of Tsukuba, JP), Tsung-Wei Huang (University of Utah, US), Keshav Pingali (University of Texas at Austin, US)

 Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society  
  through the Technical Committee on Parallel Processing (TCPP)  
 Most modern computing systems are heterogeneous  , either for organic reasons  because components grew independently, as it is the case in desktop grids, or by design  to leverage the strength of specific hardware, as it is the case in accelerated systems. In any case, all computing systems have some form of hardware or software heterogeneity   that must be managed, leveraged, understood, and exploited. The Heterogeneity in Computing Workshop (HCW) is a venue to discuss and innovate in all theoretical and practical aspects of heterogeneous computing: design, programmability, efficient utilization, algorithms, modeling, applications, etc. HCW 2023 will be the thirty-second annual gathering of this workshop.  
 Topics  
 Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Heterogeneous Computing for Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)  : Design, exploration, benchmarking, and analysis of accelerators and software frameworks for ML and DL applications on heterogeneous computing systems.
