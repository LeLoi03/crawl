 REFSQ 2023  
 Welcome to the website of the REFSQ 2023  conference!  
 The 29th International Working Conference on Requirement Engineering: Foundation for Software Quality  will take place from the 17th to 20th of April 2023 in Barcelona, Catalunya, Spain ( live, in-person  ).  
 Special Theme: Human Values in Requirements Engineering   
 RE is at the boundary of humans and technology, and values play a crucial role in the interplay between developers, users and systems. When developing technology, we get to be cognizant of how our values inform our designs, because we unconsciously embed them into our systems. In addition, we need to carefully consider possible conflicts between human values and business value. The theme of this year thus aims to foster discussion around the following questions:  
 Call for Papers

 RE23 Participants  
 Requirements Engineering 2023 is over  
 Welcome to the website of the 31st IEEE International Requirements Engineering 2023 conference  . The IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference is the premier requirements engineering conference, where researchers, practitioners, students and educators meet, present and discuss the most recent innovations, trends, experiences and issues in the field of requirements engineering. The 31st edition of RE (RE’23) was hosted at Leibniz Universität Hannover in Germany, from September 4-8, 2023.  
 We enjoyed a fully onsite event in Hannover, Germany, where we met after three years of online conferences.  
 Thank you!   
 We thank all participants, authors, and all others who contributed to the success of the conference. You made this week a highlight in the RE year.
