 Welcome to EuroVis 2023  
 The link to the Digital Library of EuroGraphics (EG) containing all publications for this year’s EuroVis can be found here  .  
 We posted some last information  on Twitter  :  
 The recommended app for public transportation is | LeipzigMOVE | (for | iOS | and | Android | ) – for all other national trains you can use the | DB Navigator | app (for | iOS | and | Android | ) 
 The exciting and vibrant field of Visualization is an increasingly important research area due to its wide range of applications in many disciplines. In general, our ability to collect, store, and archive data vastly exceed our ability to derive useful knowledge and insight. This is a ubiquitous problem. Data visualization is key to understanding large, complex data sets by exploiting the human visual system. Data visualization leverages computer graphics in order to provide a visual overview, explore, analyze, and present phenomena that are often difficult to understand.  
 The objective of the EuroVis conference is to create and strengthen connections between visualization researchers and practitioners, to foster collaborations, and to draw more researchers in Europe to enter this rapidly growing area of research. EuroVis has an expanded scope to include all areas of visualization and steadily more widespread visibility that allows achieving a more widespread impact.  
 The main conference is preceded by co-located events held in the same location on June 12th.

5. EuroVis_3 conference:
The 27th edition of EuroVis will take place in Luxembourg City, Luxembourg, and will be hosted by the Visualization and Interaction Group (VISINT) of the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST).   
 EuroVis is the premier annual conference organized by the Eurographics Working Group on Data Visualization  .  
 As a dynamic and rapidly evolving field, visualization plays a critical role in addressing one of today’s most pressing challenges: transforming vast amounts of raw data into meaningful insights. While data collection and storage capabilities have advanced exponentially, our capacity to derive actionable knowledge from this information lags behind. Visualization bridges this gap by utilizing the power of the human visual system, combined with advanced computer graphics, to offer intuitive exploration, analysis, and communication of complex data.
