  Special session: Movie screening "Journeys of Black Mathematicians"  
 In a special session at WoLLIC 2023, we showed clips from a documentary film that explores the groundbreaking achievements of African American mathematicians. "Journeys of Black Mathematicians" ( zalafilms.com  ) is a powerful film that traces the history of these pioneering individuals and their impact on mathematics. This film is not only a tribute to their achievements, but also an inspiration for Black and other minority students to pursue their studies and consider careers in mathematics.  
 The film is currently in production and its filmmaker George Csicsery, has agreed to show us excerpts from a rough cut of this film. He was also available via Zoom to hear feedback and answer questions.

  Developing the effective self-reporting tool to maintain active engagement of cardiovascular patients in the healthcare process.   
 The WorldCist'23 – 11st World Conference on Information Systems and Technologies was held in Italy, Pisa from 4 to 6 April 2023. Hanna Vitaliyivna Denysyuk was granted an ITC grant in our Action, with the help of which she participated with the paper entitled “Self-reporting Tool for Cardiovascular Patients”, that was included in the Software Systems, Architectures, Applications and Tools section among the 14 main themes proposed for the Conference.  
 The research's motive of this work was to develop the most effective self-reporting tool utilizing a mobile phone and smartwatch to track blood pressure thus offering opportunities to maintain active engagement of cardiovascular patients in the healthcare process by promoting the adoption of healthy behaviours and well-being outcomes.
6. WORLDCOMP_2 conference:
Second warning sign: the conference lists 21 different tracks  that span the gamut of CS research areas from Bioinformatics & Computational Biology (BIOCOMP) and e-Learning, e-Business, Enterprise Information Systems, & e-Government (EEE) to Foundations of Computer Science (FCS) and Grid, Cloud, & Cluster Computing (GCC). It doesn't have a concentration. 
  Third warning sign: it advertises as "IEEE CPS" upfront likely to feign credibility. The fact is that doesn't mean it is sponsored by IEEE  . CPS is IEEE's "Conference Publication Services" where they index papers published by other conferences for a fee  . 
  Forth warning sign: "Professor Hamid R. Arabnia" is the chair. From what I can find, he's actually retired. If you're unfamiliar with him, he has gained a notorious reputation for running fraudulent conferences with these same red flags. He used to run WORLDCOMP which got roasted in this subreddit 11 years ago  and a sock puppet account even replied in that thread to defend it with a copy-and-paste post it had in another one of its four total posts -- all alleging a conspiracy to defame him  . Alarms were also raised 5 years ago when he rebranded it as "CSCI"  . In fact, the old WORLDCOMP website world-academy-of-science.org  currently redirects to the latest renaming of the conference, "CSCE" at american-cse.org  . 
  Allegations about these conferences (including on the previous reddit threads as well as elsewhere  ) are that there is no real peer review happening and it is a predatory conference that just accepts anything and cashes in on registration fees. Many legitimate researchers have complained that they were duped by the conference and when they attended it (always in Las Vegas, as far as I can tell), there were some real research presentations but it was obvious that there was no meaningful peer review being conducted to assure that the research was sound.  
 update  - after filtering "@american-cse.org" as spam, I'm now getting daily emails for the same CFP from "@world-comp.org" addresses.

TCSN Seminar Series 
 JUNE 12-15 2023  
  Boston, Massachusetts  
 SCOPE AND OVERVIEW  
 IEEE WoWMoM 2023 is soliciting original and previously unpublished papers addressing research challenges and advances in the areas of wireless, mobile, and multimedia networking as well as ubiquitous and pervasive systems and applications. Wireless networking technologies are continuously evolving and have become a critical part of modern life, be it for communication services, media distribution, or sensing and actuation services within the Internet of Things (IoT) context. Appropriate resource management, application design, and architectural networking paradigms are necessary to provide users with high quality experience in multimedia communication and services. Edge computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are becoming essential tools to cope with the increasing diversity of connected devices and the plethora of new data-intensive and latency-sensitive applications. At the same time, the interoperability among IoT environments (including wearable computing and sensors), the network edge, and the cloud are evolving towards an fog-edge-cloud continuum that is expected to support a wide range of application domains and services in a more smooth and efficient manner. In this context, providing rich sets of measurements for characterizing, and understanding the behavior of such complex systems is of paramount importance.  
 IEEE WoWMoM 2023 takes a broad view and seeks papers describing innovative research contributions to the field of mobile and wireless networking and applications. We solicit papers that present original work, validated by experimentation, simulation, or analysis. We also welcome practical experiences and experimental efforts from both industry and academia, duly documenting the lessons learned from testbeds, field trials, or real deployments.  
 SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST  
 5G/ 6G networks for mobile and multimedia services
