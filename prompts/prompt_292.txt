 The Web Conference  
 The Web Conference (formerly WWW conference) is a yearly international conference on the topic of the future directions of the World Wide Web.  
 The Conference aims to provide the world with a premier forum for discussion and debate about the evolution of the Web, the standardization of its associated technologies, and the impact of those technologies on society and culture. The conference brings together researchers, developers, users and commercial ventures — indeed all those who are passionate about the Web and what it has to offer.

 Many of these have transcended the limitations of their original ecosystems in isolation, becoming creative works in ways that would have been impossible without the Web as a collaboration, cooperation, and publication platform. More and more often, we see the Web as a facilitator of creative work not just between collaborating humans, but also between humans and machines.  
 Much attention has been given to the information content of the Web. This track investigates the creative aspects of this content on the Web. The track consists of two strands: a research strand and (focusing on the scientific study of Web creativity systems) an art works strand (focusing on the creative output of such systems). Through the submissions and session at the conference we hope to gain more insights into the following:  
 What is creativity on the Web? 
  In what forms does creativity on the Web manifest? 
 We invite two types of contributions:  
 For the research strand, we invite original papers that describe original and unpublished research work. Research strand contributions should be between 4 and 8 content pages, including all figures and tables, but exclude supplementary material and references; 
  For the art strand, we invite 2-page extended abstracts that describe art projects that use the Web either as a source, publication method or reflect on the Web. We encourage contributors to reflect on the connection between their art work and the central questions and/or topics of the track. Submissions to the art strand must include a presentation format section with a description of how their contribution can be accessed or experienced (e.g. a live concert, a video recording, a printed painting, etc.), and the author’s plans for showing their work in the track exhibition space. 
 Review procedure  
 All submissions will be peer-reviewed and evaluated on the basis of originality, relevance, quality, and technical, sociological, or creative contribution. Research papers will be reviewed according to their relevance, method, and scientific rigour. Art abstracts will be reviewed according to their significance, originality and use of Web creativity.  
 Please carefully verify that when submitting your contribution, that it is related to creativity and the Web. Ensure the connection to a topic or topics within the track is evident on the first page of your paper. This is important because your paper will be assessed early on regarding its relevance to the conference and its relevance to the track-specific CFP of the track that you submitted to, and will be rejected with minimal feedback (“desk rejected”) if it does not fit that track.  
 Formatting the submissions  
 Publication policy  
 Accepted papers will require a further revision in order to meet the requirements and page limits of the camera-ready format required by ACM. Instructions for the preparation of the camera-ready versions of the papers will be provided after acceptance.  
  All accepted papers will be published by ACM in the conference proceedings together with the research track papers and will be available via the ACM Digital Library. To be included in the proceedings, at least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper there.

 Registration is now open for XP 2023, the 24th International Conference on Agile Software Development   
 June 13-16, 2023 • Amsterdam, The Netherlands   
 XP is the premier Agile software development conference combining research and practice. It is a unique forum where Agile researchers, practitioners, thought leaders, coaches, and trainers gather to present and discuss their most recent innovations and research results.  
 At its inception over 20 years ago, the XP conference focused solely on eXtreme Programming. It quickly widened its scope to include all modern Agile approaches and Agility’s developing aspects. XP draws people from around the globe, providing a diverse and inclusive environment for learning and inspiring conversations.  
 The theme for XP 2023 is “Whole Team Sustainability”  
 The theme for XP2023 is “Whole Team Sustainability,” a multi-faceted theme centering on the need to band together to solve the complex challenges of our time. Agile has long focused on the ability to truly work as a whole team, bringing all our different skills and viewpoints to bear on our common purpose: strong engineering skills working hand-in-hand with top-level product vision, supported and sustained by modern management and a focus on resilience over efficiency.   
 The worldwide necessity to take action for our environment makes the need for that philosophy in more aspects of our society starkly clear.  
 An in-person conference in the heart of Amsterdam!  
 For the first time in its long history, XP 2023 will be in The Netherlands, at “Pakhuis De Zwijger” right in the middle of Amsterdam. In the center of the city, on the waterfront, there’s no better place to get together with colleagues from across the world and no better base from which to explore Amsterdam.  
 XP 2023 Program Components   
 Research Workshops   
 Interactive Track (with Engineering!)   
 Next to our planned content programming, XP 2023 will have a full, guided, interactive track aimed at bringing participants together, facilitate networking and shared learning, and making room for everyone to be fully engaged. We will also have a unique Engineering Interactive Track, where we can practice what we preach and build software together throughout the conference in a continuous, ensemble programming, session.  
 Industry & Practice   
 Workshops, demonstrations, and presentations based on the speaker’s experience and practice working in the industry. The theme for these session reflects that of the conference: “Whole Team Sustainability” with main topics around Leadership and Culture, Engineering, Product and Design, Process Innovation, Agile in Education and Training, and Sustainability  
 Open Access Publication   
 All peer-reviewed academic research presented at the conference will be available on the website as an open access Springer publication. We believe that research is useful to practitioners and should be shared widely, not hidden behind a paywall. There will be two publications, one before and one after the conference, containing research papers and workshop papers.  
 Register Now     
 Email registration@agilealliance.org    with requests.   
 No-shows are liable for the entire conference fee.   
 Agile Alliance reserves the right to cancel the event or substitute speakers. In the unlikely event that Agile Alliance should have to cancel the Agile2023 conference, attendees will be refunded for the amount paid for the conference.
