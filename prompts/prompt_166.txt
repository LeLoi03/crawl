 Call For Papers, ACM IMC 2023  
 The Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) is a highly selective venue for the presentation of measurement-based research in data communications. As we are in the era of data-driven research, IMC 2023 will focus on improving the standard in the collection, usage, and sharing of network measurements for the research community. Despite the efforts in stimulating reproducibility of research as well as sharing of data, little progress has been made in our community to make research data open. Therefore, without fundamentally changing the topics in scope compared to previous years, our attention when assessing contributions will be particularly on the willingness of the authors to share their data and make their work reproducible.  
 New this year:  To encourage data sharing and reproducibility, authors will be required to make a declaration on artifact availability (full, partial, or no availability) for the submitted work. Since legitimate reasons (such as proprietary and privacy reasons) may prevent authors from sharing artifacts, papers will be assessed based on whether the contributions warrant acceptance despite the lack of artifact availability. In the case of no availability of artifacts, the authors are expected to explain why this is the case in a specific section. Artifact submission is not required at the paper submission time. All papers accepted to the program will be shepherded to ensure that the artifacts promised have been made available.  
 IMC takes a broad view of contributions that are considered in scope for improving the practice of network measurement, including, but not limited to:  
 collection and analysis of data that yield new insights about network structure and network performance (e.g., traffic, topology, routing, energy utilization, performance) 
  collection and analysis of data that yield new insights about application and end-user behavior (e.g., economics, privacy, security, application interaction with protocols) 
  experimental networks, prototype networks, and future internetworks 
  Replicability Track:   
 IMC 2023 will trial a new Replicability Track for submissions that aim to reproduce or replicate results that have been previously published at IMC. Papers accepted to this track will be published in ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review (CCR). Priority will be given to replicability studies, although reproducibility studies are also in scope. For the definitions, please see ACM’s site  . The authors of outstanding replicability papers may receive an invitation to present at the main conference. In that case, the paper would also be included in IMC’s proceedings (rather than CCR).  
 Submissions to this track are two-phase. Prospective authors are invited to submit an Expression of Interest (EoI) via the submission system in the form of an abstract which must explain:  
 Which paper the authors aim to replicate 
  Whether the paper will be replicated or reproduced 
  What the IMC community stands to learn from the replication or reproduction 
  Chosen approach, and why it will lead to new insights 
  A small committee will evaluate the EoIs and their potential to be of interest to the IMC community. The authors of strong abstracts will receive an invitation to a full submission.  
 The EoI serves to avoid misunderstandings and disappointment for authors as we acknowledge that replicating or reproducing a paper is a very significant effort to which potential authors would commit much time.  
 Full submissions will then be assessed by a sub-committee of the TPC. Full submissions must otherwise conform to the same criteria and rules as full submissions on the main track (see below).  
 See the Important Dates section  for the EoI deadline. Full submissions have the same deadlines (abstract registration and full submission) as the IMC main deadline.  
 Review process and criteria  
 IMC 2023 invites two forms of submissions:  
 Full papers | (up to 13 pages for text and figures + unlimited pages for references and appendix) that describe original research, with succinctness appropriate to the topics and themes they discuss. 
  Short papers | (up to 6 pages for text and figures + unlimited pages for references and appendix) that convey work that is less mature but shows exciting promise, OR offer results that do not merit a full submission. Short papers could articulate a high-level vision and describe challenging future directions that the authors believe the community should tackle; validate, verify, or update important results; or present new ideas that challenge existing assumptions. 
  Any submission exceeding the short paper page-length limit will be evaluated as a full paper.  
 Authors should submit only original work that has not been published before and is not under submission to any other venue. We will consider full paper submissions that extend previously published short, preliminary papers (including IMC short papers), in accordance with the SIGCOMM policy  and the ACM Plagiarism Policy  . The ACM policy on simultaneous submissions  does not consider technical reports (including arXiv) to be concurrent publication or submission.  
 IMC 2023 will bestow two awards on paper submissions, (1) a Best Paper award; and (2) a Community Contribution award. The best paper award will recognize the outstanding paper at the conference, and all accepted papers are eligible for it. The community contribution award will recognize a paper with an outstanding contribution to the community in the form of a new dataset, source code distribution, open platform, or other noteworthy service to the community. To be eligible for the community award, the authors must make data or source code publicly available or have a software artifact that is accessible and usable by the public at the time of the camera-ready deadline. The authors indicate their eligibility on the submission form and are also encouraged to include a link to the contribution in the submitted paper.  
 A few accepted papers may be forwarded for fast-track submission to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking.  
 Early Rejection  
 The review process will have several reviewing rounds. To allow authors time to improve their work and submit to other venues, authors of submissions for which there is a consensus on rejection will be notified early.  
 Anonymity Guidelines  
 Authors are expected to make a good-faith effort to anonymize papers. As an author, you should not identify yourself in the paper either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references).  
 Anonymization of important details are not required, if they are critical for the evaluation of the paper. For example, system names may be left de-anonymized, if the system name is important for a reviewer to be able to evaluate the work, and the paper may point to existing public datasets and artifacts that highlight or underscore the contributions outlined in the paper.  
 Please follow the following guidelines:  
 Author names and affiliations must not appear on any submission. 
  Identifying information such as grant numbers must not be included on submissions. 
  The text of the submission must refer to the authors’ own previous work in the third person, unless the previous work provides important context for evaluation of the existing contribution (e.g., the paper describes an implementation or deployment of a method previously developed by the same authors). 
  Authors are explicitly allowed to post their submissions on Arxiv or other public websites, and reviewers will be discouraged from searching for such listings while a submission is under review. However, authors are strongly discouraged from engaging in publicity for their papers while they are under review, unless doing so is in the public interest (e.g., responsible disclosure). Authors who are unsure of whether they are allowed to publicize their double-blind submissions should contact the program committee co-chairs at imc2023pcchairs@acm.org  .  
 Additional details on paper anonymity are available here  and in the statement released by the IMC Steering Committee here  .  
 Ethics  
 The program committee may raise concerns around the ethics of the work, even if it does not involve human subjects. All papers must include, in a clearly marked appendix section with the heading “Ethics”, a statement about ethical issues; papers that do not include such a statement may be rejected.  This could be, if appropriate for the paper, simply the sentence “This work does not raise any ethical issues.”. If the work involves human subjects or potentially sensitive data (e.g., user traffic or social network information, evaluation of censorship, etc.), the paper should clearly discuss these issues, perhaps in a separate subsection.  
 Research that entails experiments involving human subjects or user data (e.g., network traffic, passwords, social network information) should adhere to community norms. Any work that raises potential ethics considerations should indicate this on the submission form. The basic principles of ethical research are outlined in the Belmont Report  : (1) respect for persons (which may involve obtaining consent); (2) beneficence (a careful consideration of risks and benefits); and (3) justice (ensuring that parts of the population that bear the risks of the research also are poised to obtain some benefit from it). Authors should further consult the ACM policy on research involving human subjects  for further information on ethical principles that apply to this conference.  
 Research involving human subjects must be approved by the researchers’ respective Institutional Review Boards before the research takes place. Authors should indicate on the submission form whether the work involves human subjects. If so, the authors must indicate whether an IRB protocol has been approved for the research, or if the research has been determined exempt (either self-determination or IRB determination). We expect that any research follows the practices and procedures of the institution(s) where the work is being carried out; for example, some universities require separate approval for the use of campus data. We expect researchers to abide by these protocols.  
 We recognize that different IRBs follow different procedures for determining the status of human subject research, and approval or exempt status from a single institution may not align with community norms. To help the Ethics Committee review cases of concern, there is a need for more information about the research protocol. To this end, if the work involves human subjects, the authors must include with their submission a copy of the form that was used to determine IRB status (approved or exempt), sufficiently anonymized to preserve double-blind review.  
 If the submission describes research involving human subjects and none of the authors are at an institution with an IRB (or equivalent), the authors are nonetheless expected to follow a research protocol that adheres to ethical principles, as stated in the ACM policy on research involving human subjects  . In such cases, the authors must use the Ethics section of their appendix to explain how their research protocol satisfies the principles of ethical research.  
 Some research does not involve human subjects yet nonetheless raises questions of ethics, which may be wide-ranging and not necessarily limited to direct effects. We encourage authors to be mindful of the ethics of the research that they undertake; these considerations are often not clear-cut, but often warrant thoughtful consideration. Discussions of these issues should be placed in the “Ethics” appendix section mentioned above, or in the main body of the paper where appropriate.  
 Additionally, the program committee reserves the right to conduct additional evaluations and reviews of research ethics and reserves the right to independent judgment concerning the ethics of the conducted research.  
 Contact the program committee co-chairs at imc2023pcchairs@acm.org  if you have any questions.  
  Providing a linked FAQ explaining the rationale for the policy and providing additional details 
  Please refer to the updated ACM Policy on Authorship  .  
 Submission guidelines  
 Below is a summary of key submission guidelines, but it is not exhaustive. For a complete list of requirements, visit the detailed submission instructions page  . Authors are expected to comply with all the requirements listed on that page.   
 All submissions must satisfy the following requirements:  
 Full papers: | up to 13 pages for technical content + unlimited pages for references and appendix 
  Note that, apart from the mandatory Ethics appendix, reviewers have no obligation to read anything in the appendices. Please use this space judiciously, and as a rule of thumb, keep it to no longer than three pages.  
 Formatting should be as follows:  
 10-point font for main text. Fonts used in other elements of the paper (e.g., figures) should be no smaller than 9 point. 
  It is your responsibility to ensure that your submission satisfies the above requirements. If you are using LaTeX, you may make use of this template for ACM conference proceedings. With the older versions of this template you must add “10pt” to the documentclass command to meet the submission requirements. The current template sets 10pt by default. (Unlike the official template, it only includes an example for conference proceedings.) 
  Submissions that do not comply with these requirements will be rejected without review. The ACM template  style file satisfies the formatting requirements, provided you compile your source with options that produce letter page size and  10-point  fonts. The following settings in your LaTeX source should achieve that (but please verify the output):  
 \documentclass[10pt,sigconf,letterpaper,anonymous]{acmart}   As an example, we also provide a sample template for ACM conference proceedings  , which you can make use of.

 SESSION: Replication

  The Internet architecture has facilitated a multi-party, distributed, and heterogeneous physical infrastructure where routers from different vendors connect and inter-operate via IP. Such vendor heterogeneity can have important security and policy implications. For example, a security vulnerability may be specific to a particular vendor and implementation, and thus will have a disproportionate impact on particular networks and paths if exploited. From a policy perspective, governments are now explicitly banning particular vendors-or have threatened to do so.  
 Despite these critical issues, the composition of router vendors across the Internet remains largely opaque. Remotely identifying router vendors is challenging due to their strict security posture, indistinguishability due to code sharing across vendors, and noise due to vendor mergers. We make progress in overcoming these challenges by developing LFP, a tool that improves the coverage, accuracy, and efficiency of router fingerprinting as compared to the current state-of-the-art. We leverage LFP to characterize the degree of router vendor homogeneity within networks and the regional distribution of vendors. We then take a path-centric view and apply LFP to better understand the potential for correlated failures and fate-sharing. Finally, we perform a case study on inter and intra-United States data paths to explore the feasibility to make vendor-based routing policy decisions, i.e., whether it is possible to avoid a particular vendor given the current infrastructure.

  Contemporary browsers constitute a critical component of our everyday interactions with the Web. Similar to a small, but powerful operating system, a browser is responsible to fetch and run web apps locally, on the user's (mobile) device. Even though in the last few years, there has been an increased interest for tools and mechanisms to block potentially malicious behaviours of web domains against the users' privacy (e.g., ad blockers, incognito browsing mode, etc.), it is still unclear if the user can browse the Web in private.  
 In this paper, we analyse the natively generated network traffic of 15 mobile browser apps under different configurations to investigate if the users are capable of browsing the Web privately, without sharing their browsing history with remote servers. We develop a novel framework (Panoptes) to instrument and monitor separately the mobile browser traffic generated by (a) the web engine and (b) natively by the mobile app. By crawling a set of websites via Panoptes, and analyzing the native traffic of browsers, we find that there are browsers (i) who persistently track their users, and (ii) browsers that report to remote servers (geolocated outside EU), the exact page and content the user is browsing at that moment. Finally, we see browsers communicating with third-party ad servers while leaking personal and device identifiers.

  Leveraging DNS for covert communications is appealing since most networks allow DNS traffic, especially the ones directed toward renowned DNS hosting services. Unfortunately, most DNS hosting services overlook domain ownership verification, enabling miscreants to host undelegated DNS records of a domain they do not own. Consequently, miscreants can conduct covert communication through such undelegated records for whitelisted domains on reputable hosting providers. In this paper, we shed light on the emerging threat posed by undelegated records and demonstrate their exploitation in the wild. To the best of our knowledge, this security risk has not been studied before.

  Measurement studies are essential for research and industry alike better understand the Web's inner workings and help quantify specific phenomena. Performing such studies is demanding due to the dynamic nature and size of the Web. Designing and setting up an experiment is a complex task, and many factors might affect the results. However, while several works have independently observed differences in the outcome of an experiment (e.g., the number of observed trackers) based on the measurement setup, it is unclear what causes such deviations. This work investigates the reasons for these differences by visiting 1.7M webpages with five different measurement setups. Based on this investigation, we build 'dependency trees' for each page and cross-compare the nodes in the trees. The results show that the measured trees differ considerably, that the cause of differences can be attributed to specific nodes, and that even identical measurement setups can produce different results.

  Interplanetary Filesystem (IPFS) is one of the largest peer-to-peer filesystems in operation. The network is the default storage layer for Web3 and is being presented as a solution to the centralization of the web. In this paper, we present a large-scale, multi-modal measurement study of the IPFS network. We analyze the topology, the traffic, the content providers and the entry points from the classical Internet. Our measurements show significant centralization in the IPFS network and a high share of nodes hosted in the cloud. We also shed light on the main stakeholders in the ecosystem. We discuss key challenges that might disrupt continuing efforts to decentralize the Web and highlight multiple properties that are creating pressures toward centralization.  
 Ethereum's Proposer-Builder Separation: Promises and Realities   
  Christof Ferreira Torres 
  Roger Wattenhofer 
  With Ethereum's transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake in September 2022 came another paradigm shift, the Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS) scheme. PBS was introduced to decouple the roles of selecting and ordering transactions in a block (i.e., the builder), from those validating its contents and proposing the block to the network as the new head of the blockchain (i.e., the proposer). In this landscape, proposers are the validators in the Proof-of-Stake consensus protocol, while now relying on specialized block builders for creating blocks with the highest value for the proposer. Additionally, relays act as mediators between builders and proposers. We study PBS adoption and show that the current landscape exhibits significant centralization amongst the builders and relays. Further, we explore whether PBS effectively achieves its intended objectives of enabling hobbyist validators to maximize block profitability and preventing censorship. Our findings reveal that although PBS grants validators the opportunity to access optimized and competitive blocks, it tends to stimulate censorship rather than reduce it. Additionally, we demonstrate that relays do not consistently uphold their commitments and may prove unreliable. Specifically, proposers do not always receive the complete promised value, and the censorship or filtering capabilities pledged by relays exhibit significant gaps.  
 SESSION: IoT  
  David Choffnes 
  Smart home IoT platforms are typically closed systems, meaning that there is poor visibility into device behavior. Understanding device behavior is important not only for determining whether devices are functioning as expected, but also can reveal implications for privacy (e.g., surreptitious audio/video recording), security (e.g., device compromise), and safety (e.g., denial of service on a baby monitor). While there has been some work on identifying devices and a handful of activities, an open question is what is the extent to which we can automatically model the entire behavior of an IoT deployment, and how it changes over time, without any privileged access to IoT devices or platform messages.  
 In this work, we demonstrate that the vast majority of IoT behavior can indeed be modeled, using a novel multi-dimensional approach that relies only on the (often encrypted) network traffic exchanged by IoT devices. Our key insight is that IoT behavior (including cross-device interactions) can often be captured using relatively simple models such as timers (for periodic behavior) and probabilistic state-machines (for user-initiated behavior and devices interactions) during a limited observation phase. We then propose deviation metrics that can identify when the behavior of an IoT device or an IoT system changes over time. Our models and metrics successfully identify several notable changes in our IoT deployment, including a camera that changed locations, network outages that impact connectivity, and device malfunctions.  
 In the Room Where It Happens: Characterizing Local Communication and Threats in Smart Homes   
  David Choffnes 
  Narseo Vallina-Rodriguez 
  The network communication between Internet of Things (IoT) devices on the same local network has significant implications for platform and device interoperability, security, privacy, and correctness. Yet, the analysis of local home Wi-Fi network traffic and its associated security and privacy threats have been largely ignored by prior literature, which typically focuses on studying the communication between IoT devices and cloud end-points, or detecting vulnerable IoT devices exposed to the Internet. In this paper, we present a comprehensive and empirical measurement study to shed light on the local communication within a smart home deployment and its threats. We use a unique combination of passive network traffic captures, protocol honeypots, dynamic mobile app analysis, and crowdsourced IoT data from participants to identify and analyze a wide range of device activities on the local network. We then analyze these datasets to characterize local network protocols, security and privacy threats associated with them. Our analysis reveals vulnerable devices, insecure use of network protocols, and sensitive data exposure by IoT devices. We provide evidence of how this information is exfiltrated to remote servers by mobile apps and third-party SDKs, potentially for household fingerprinting, surveillance and cross-device tracking. We make our datasets and analysis publicly available to support further research in this area.  
 Behind the Scenes: Uncovering TLS and Server Certificate Practice of IoT Device Vendors in the Wild   
  Piyush Kumar Sharma 
  Tor, one of the most popular censorship circumvention systems, faces regular blocking attempts by censors. Thus, to facilitate access, it relies on "pluggable transports" (PTs) that disguise Tor's traffic and make it hard for the adversary to block Tor. However, these are not yet well studied and compared for the performance they provide to the users. Thus, we conduct a first comparative performance evaluation of a total of 12 PTs-the ones currently supported by the Tor project and those that can be integrated in the future.  
 Our results reveal multiple facets of the PT ecosystem. (1) PTs' download time significantly varies even under similar network conditions. (2) All PTs are not equally reliable. Thus, clients who regularly suffer censorship may falsely believe that such PTs are blocked. (3) PT performance depends on the underlying communication primitive. (4) PTs performance significantly depends on the website access method (browser or command-line). Surprisingly, for some PTs, website access time was even less than vanilla Tor.  
 Based on our findings from more than 1.25M measurements, we provide recommendations about selecting PTs and believe that our study can facilitate access for users who face censorship.

 In this paper, we present the results of a comprehensive measurement study of the congestion control algorithm (CCA) implementations for 11 popular open-source QUIC stacks. We propose a new metric called Conformance-T that can help us identify the implementations with large deviations more accurately and also provide hints on how they can be modified to be more conformant to reference kernel implementations. Our results show that while most QUIC CCA implementations are conformant in shallow buffers, they become less conformant in deep buffers. In the process, we also identified five new QUIC implementations that had low conformance and demonstrated how low-conformance implementations can cause unfairness and subvert our expectations of how we expect different CCAs to interact. With the hints obtained from our new metric, we were able to identify implementation-level differences that led to the low conformance and derive the modifications required to improve conformance for three of them.

  Encrypted QUIC traffic complicates network management as traditional transport layer semantics can no longer be used for RTT or packet loss measurements. Addressing this challenge, QUIC includes an optional, carefully designed mechanism: the spin bit. While its capabilities have already been studied in test settings, its real-world usefulness and adoption are unknown. In this paper, we thus investigate the spin bit's deployment and utility on the web.

  In this paper, we show that utilizing multiple protocols offers a unique opportunity to improve IP alias resolution and dual-stack inference substantially. Our key observation is that prevalent protocols, e.g., SSH and BGP, reply to unsolicited requests with a set of values that can be combined to form a unique device identifier. More importantly, this is possible by just completing the TCP hand-shake. Our empirical study shows that utilizing readily available scans and our active measurements can double the discovered IPv4 alias sets and more than 30× the dual-stack sets compared to the state-of-the-art techniques. We provide insights into our method's accuracy and performance compared to popular techniques.
