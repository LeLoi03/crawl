 TAP 2023 - 17th International Conference on Tests and Proofs  
 Scope   
 The TAP conference promotes research in verification and formal methods that targets the interplay of proofs and testing: the advancement of techniques of each kind and their combination, with the ultimate goal of improving software and system dependability.  
 Research in verification has seen a steady convergence of heterogeneous techniques and a synergy between the traditionally distinct areas of testing (and dynamic analysis) and of proving (and static analysis). Formal techniques for counter-example generation based on, for example, symbolic execution, SAT/SMT-solving or model checking, furnish evidence for the potential of a combination of test and proof. The combination of predicate abstraction with testing-like techniques based on exhaustive enumeration opens the perspective for novel techniques of proving correctness. On the practical side, testing offers cost-effective debugging techniques of specifications or crucial parts of program proofs (such as invariants). Last but not least, testing is indispensable when it comes to the validation of the underlying assumptions of complex system models involving hardware or system environments. Over the years, there is growing acceptance in research communities that testing and proving are complementary rather than mutually exclusive techniques.  
 The TAP conference aims to promote research in the intersection of testing and proving by bringing together researchers and practitioners from both areas of verification.

 SecOPERA at 17th International Conference on Tests and Proofs (TAP 2023)  
 / News   / By alexander      
 SecOPERA partner CEA  actively participated in the 17th International Conference on Tests and Proofs (TAP)  , which was held on 18-19 July in Leicester, UK. This conference, organized by the University of Leicester as part of the STAF federation of conferences, aimed to foster research in software verification, focusing on the convergence of tests and formal methods. The program committee, co-chaired by Virgile Prevosto, facilitated the gathering of researchers and practitioners from both realms to exchange ideas and present their findings.  
 The results presented in the conference are thus primarily useful for the application layer of SecOPERA, notably for the Security Audit engine.
