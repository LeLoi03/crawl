  Canadian play on climate change brings digital and physical worlds crashing together | Published:   
 August 31, 2023 | [This CBC story describes a creative and boundary-extending use of virtual reality and presence in a theater experience designed by Chris Salter, the Director of the Immersive Arts Space at the Zurich University of the Arts. See the original story for four more pictures. The Montreal shows have unfortunately ended but you can find out more about Animate on the MUTEK website. –Matthew] [Image: An audience in the Italian city of Paestum watches a performance of the VR-enhanced play Animate by director Chris Salter.

  Real cows, not CGI’d versions, are stars of this 3D illusions billboard campaign in UK | Published:   
 August 30, 2023 | [Arguably another step toward more effective presence illusions, a new 3D billboard campaign for the UK retail chain Marks & Spencer features live action, ‘in camera’ images rather than computer-generated ones. For context, coverage in DesignTAXI notes that “If there’s an emerging trend in the world of out-of-home advertisements, it’s 3D billboards. Previously, Subway allowed passers-by to design their very own sandwiches in real-time, while Adidas celebrated Lionel Messi’s World Cup victory with a giant display.” Creative Review adds ”The 3D billboard is definitely having a moment, with brands using the format to sell everything from movies to trainers (see… | Read more : Real cows, not CGI’d versions, are stars of this 3D illusions billboard campaign in UK

  Medium-as-social-actor presence: If AI becomes conscious, how will we know? | Published:   
 August 28, 2023 | [For decades now the misperception that a computer is a human-like social actor rather than just a technology following its programming has been considered an illusion. And until recently it seemed clear that the perception of an AI as more than a technology was too. But as this story from Science reports, as technology evolves the distinctions become less clear. Scholars across disciplines are now developing methods and measures to help us separate effective mimicry that evokes medium-as-social-actor presence, from machines that have actually attained consciousness. Even defining the key terms is challenging (e.g., consciousness is not the same as… | Read more : Medium-as-social-actor presence: If AI becomes conscious, how will we know?

  Scream therapy: The benefits of immersive horror | Published:   
 August 24, 2023 | [This story from Psychology Today describes potential psychological benefits of immersive horror experiences that combine “live actors, intricate sets, physical effects like heat and cold, and psychological ‘tricks’ to help induce fear.” As the author is careful to note, these intense experiences aren’t recommended for or appealing to everyone (!). See the original version for a second image. –Matthew] [Image: Credit: Mathias Verduyckt / Quietus Horror] Scream Therapy: The Benefits of Immersive Horror The unexpected mental health benefits of facing fear through immersive horror.

 Special Issue on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation (ISSAC 2023)  
  We are inviting submissions of high-quality original research papers that showcase significant contributions to the field. The focus of this special issue will be on works presented at ISSAC 2023, including papers, tutorials, plenary talks, short communications, and software presentations. We encourage substantial additions to these presentations, such as significant generalizations or comprehensive implementation reports. However, we also welcome submissions that closely relate to the topics discussed at ISSAC 2023.  
  Guest editors: Marianne Akian (INRIA Saclay Île-de-France and CMAP, France) 
  Elias Tsigaridas, Executive Guest Editor (Inria Paris and Sorbonne University, France) 
  Manuscript submission information:  
  Tentative Schedule: Submission Open Date: September 15, 2023 
  Submission Deadline: December 15, 2023 
  Editorial Acceptance Deadline: April 2024 
  The introduction of the paper must succinctly explain the problem considered, explicitly describe its importance, the contribution of the paper, how it is related to the existing literature. In addition and when applicable, the authors should explain in a cover letter to the editors and reviewers what the significant improvements and enhancements are, compared to the related ISSAC 2023 paper.  
  Since there is no severe page limit, the paper must be complete, with all issues be carefully discussed, all relevant references properly cited and discussed, all theorems rigorously proved with (reasonable) details, all important definitions/theorems/algorithms illustrated by well chosen examples, all feedbacks from the conference's referee process addressed.
