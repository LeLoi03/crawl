 Title  : Learning Temporal Logic Formulas from Time-series Data 
 Abstract  : The availability of data has spurred the utilization of machine learning techniques for system analysis. While these methods excel in complex, high-dimensional scenarios and generate powerful black-box models, they often lack uncertainty measures and fail to fully understand the underlying mechanisms. This limitation becomes especially crucial in safety-critical systems, where failures can be costly. Therefore, designers must comprehend system phenomena and extract meaningful knowledge from the data. To tackle this challenge, recent research has explored the application of learning Temporal Logic (TL) formulae as a means of extracting human-interpretable information. TL offers precise formal formulae that are easily comprehensible to humans and provides verification algorithms that can automatically evaluate the fulfillment of desired properties. In this talk, we provide an overview of recent advancements in this field, with a specific focus on learning Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is particularly well-suited for expressing properties related to real-time trajectories. We delve into supervised and semi-supervised learning problems, highlighting the utility of TL formulae, e.g. for anomaly detection. Additionally, we show how the consideration of spatial aspects in system behavior can be accomplished by using STREL, an extension of STL with a number of spatial operators.

  About The Conference  
 The International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries (TPDL) is a yearly date for researchers on Digital Libraries and related topics. For over twenty-five years TPDL has been an international reference forum focused on digital libraries and associated technical, practical, and social issues. TPDL encompasses the many meanings of the term “digital libraries”, including new forms of information institutions; operational information systems with all manner of digital content; new means of selecting, collecting, organizing, and distributing digital content; and theoretical models of information media, including document genres and electronic publishing. Digital libraries may be viewed as a new form of information institution or as an extension of the services libraries currently provide. Representatives from academia government, industry, research communities, research infrastructures, and others are invited to participate in this annual conference. The conference draws from a broad and multidisciplinary array of research areas including computer science, information science, librarianship, archival science and practice, museum studies and practice, technology, social sciences, cultural heritage and humanities, and scientific communities. This year its focus is on bridging the wide field of Research and Information Science with the related field of Digital Libraries. Indeed, TPDL historically approached on “Digital libraries” embracing the field at large also comprehending three key areas of interest that can be synthesized as scholarly communication  (e.g. research data, research software, digital experiments, digital libraries), e-science/computationally-intense research  (e.g. scientific workflows, Virtual Research Environments, reproducibility) and library archive and information science  (e.g. governance policies, open access, open science). This emphasises TPDL’s role over the last 25 years as a forum that brings together researchers and practitioners whose work intersects with Digital Libraries. Regardless of how your work connects with Digital Libraries, we invite you to participate.  
 The conference is organized in two tracks:  
 Research & Practitioner Full Papers Track 
  Short and Accelerating Innovation Papers Track

  Abstract  
 AI is being used in the GLAM sector for a wide range of tasks such as recommendation, classification, tagging, handwriting recognition, OCR, etc. While the benefits of AI for the sector are clearly visible, there are also valid concerns regarding fairness and bias. Responsible AI is a hot topic in the AI research community, resulting in a large number of fairness metrics and bias mitigation strategies. This keynote will address the specific opportunities and challenges that arise when aiming for Responsible AI in the GLAM sector. Firstly, we will discus differences in fairness goals between the GLAM sector and other sectors. Secondly, we show how the availability of data - or lack thereof - has largely determined the research directions in the field of Responsible AI. Data curation as done in GLAM may be a way forward. Finally, in the GLAM sector, bias may be engrained in collections and/or metadata. An example from the Dutch GLAM sector is the colonial perspective often found in historic collections. This type of bias is hard to address. We show how the AI and GLAM communities may collaborate to measure and mitigate this type of bias.

  Abstract  
 How can we invite AI into the archive? The majority of language technology development in my group is highly interdisciplinary working directly with domain experts and users. This keynote will showcase two Digital Humanities research projects in which we used natural language processing for conducting Scottish Gaelic handwriting recognition of written descriptions of a sound archive and for detecting bias in an archival catalogue. Both projects have specifically focussed on the data creation and digitisation processes or on the product and presentation of collection documentation. AI should be invited into the archives as it can be extremely useful to make advancements in these areas. However continuous conversation and co-design between computer scientists, archivists cataloguers and language experts are required to succeed in this work. I will provide some insights into the successes and challenges we faced in our work, and what is needed to create AI language technologies that can work with the uncertainties and complexities of heritage datasets.

  recommender systems. Many operators of academic products such as  
  digital libraries and reference managers avoid this effort, although  
  a recommender system could provide significant benefits to their  
  users. In this paper, we introduce Mr. DLib’s “Recommendations as-a-Service"  
  (RaaS) API that allows operators of academic products to easily integrate  
  a scientific recommender system into their products. Mr. DLib generates  
  used by GESIS´ Sowiport and by the reference manager JabRef. Mr.  
  DLib is open source and its goal is to facilitate the application  
  of, and research on, scientific recommender systems. In this paper,  
  we present the motivation for Mr. DLib, the architecture and details

  abstract = {Google Scholar is one of the major academic search engines but its ranking algorithm for academic articles is unknown. We performed the first steps to reverse-engineering Google Scholar’s ranking algorithm and present the results in this research-in-progress paper. The results are: Citation counts is the highest weighed factor in Google Scholar’s ranking algorithm. Therefore, highly cited articles are found significantly more often in higher positions than articles that have been cited less often. As a consequence, Google Scholar seems to be more suitable for finding standard literature than gems or articles by authors advancing a new or different view from the mainstream. However, interesting exceptions for some search queries occurred. Moreover, the occurrence of a search term in an article’s title seems to have a strong impact on the article’s ranking. The impact of search term frequencies in an article’s full text is weak. That means it makes no difference in an article’s ranking if the article contains the query terms only once or multiple times. It was further researched whether the name of an author or journal has an impact on the ranking and whether differences exist between the ranking algorithms of different search modes that Google Scholar offers. The answer in both of these cases was "yes". The results of our research may help authors to optimize their articles for Google Scholar and enable researchers to estimate the usefulness of Google Scholar with respect to their search intention and hence the need to use further academic search engines or databases.},
