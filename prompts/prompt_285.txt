 Scope  
 Approximation and online algorithms are fundamental tools to deal with computationally hard problems and problems in which the input is gradually disclosed over time. Both kinds of problems arise from a large number of applications in a variety of fields. The Workshop on Approximation and Online Algorithms (WAOA)  focuses on the design and analysis of approximation and online algorithms. It also covers experimental methods used to design and analyze efficient approximation and online algorithms. It is co-located with ALGO 2023  , which also hosts ESA  , ALGOCLOUD  , ALGOWIN  , ATMOS  and IPEC  . ALGO 2023  will take place in the beautiful city of Amsterdam in the Netherlands.

  Scheduling problems 
  Submission guidelines  
 Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract or full paper of at most 10 pages excluding the title page, references, and an optional appendix. The submission should be typeset using a 10-point or larger font in a single-column format with ample spacing throughout and 2cm margins all around on A4-size paper. Proofs omitted due to space constraints must be placed in an appendix. This appendix can even comprise an entire full version of the paper. The appendix will be read by the program committee members at their discretion. In particular, appendices of accepted papers are not going to be published in the proceedings. The main part of the submission should therefore contain a clear technical presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper’s importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims.  
 The conference employs a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work is in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, references should not be omitted or anonymized.  
 By submitting a paper the authors acknowledge that in case of acceptance at least one of the authors must register at ALGO 2023, attend the conference onsite and present the paper.  
 The program committee may award a Best Paper Award to one of the accepted papers.  
 Invited speaker  
 Nicole Megow, University of Bremen  
 Proceedings will be published in the Springer series Lecture Notes in Computer Science after the workshop takes place.

 The World Wide Web has become part of our everyday life, and information retrieval and data mining on the Web are now of enormous practical interest. The algorithms supporting these activities combine the view of the Web as a text repository and as a graph, induced in various ways by links among pages, hosts and users.  
 The aim of the 18th Workshop on Algorithms and Models for the Web Graph (WAW 2023)  is to further the understanding of graphs that arise from the Web and various user activities on the Web, and stimulate the development of high-performance algorithms and applications that exploit these graphs. The workshop will also welcome the researchers who are working on graph-theoretic and algorithmic aspects of citation networks, social networks, biological networks, molecular networks, and the Internet.  
 WAW 2023  will be held at the Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences  , Toronto, Canada. All participants are encouraged to join the Workshop on Modelling and Mining Complex Networks as Hypergraphs  that will be held at the Toronto Metropolitan University  (May 15-19, 2023).

 WCAE provides a forum for educators in computer architecture to discuss  
  and share their experiences and teaching philosophy. Past WCAEs have been held  
  others. The materials submitted should be detailed enough so that  
  other instructors could use them to construct assignments for their own  
  courses, but not detailed enough that someone could re-use a submission to your  
  assignment as a submission to another instructor’s assignment based on your  
  materials.   
 Ideas for nifty assignments should be emailed to the organizer (efg@ncsu.edu) rather than submitted through EasyChair  .
