  About the ISMB/ECCB 2023 Conference  
 The annual international conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) is the flagship meeting of the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB). The 2023 conference is the 31st ISMB conference, which has grown to become the world's largest bioinformatics and computational biology conference. Joining forces with the European Conference on Computational Biology (22nd Annual Conference) ISMB/ECCB 2023 will be the year's most important computational biology event globally.  
 The conference will offer both in-person and virtual attendance. We will welcome you to join us in Lyon, France or virtually in our state of the art virtual interface.  
 ISMB/ECCB brings together scientists from computer science, molecular biology, mathematics, statistics and related fields. Its principal focus is on the development and application of advanced computational methods for biological problems.  
  Participants will have the opportunity to enjoy:  
  Ability to serendipitously make new connections when utilizing the attendee profile and match maker features within the virtual platform 
  Schedule one-on-one time with speakers, poster presenters, exhibitors, and sponsors to learn more about their work, products, or services 
  Exclusive access to the ISMB/ECCB 2023 on-demand repository of talks and poster presentations for viewing at your leisure after conference dates 
  ISMB provides an intense multidisciplinary forum for disseminating the latest developments in bioinformatics/computational biology, fostering fresh dialogues and perspectives to learn about and shape the future of the field. In response to the increasing interest in the activities of the ISCB’s Communities of Special Interest (COSIs) the conference is organized with the active participation of the COSIs in the development of the program and highlights emerging or "hot" research areas providing an outstanding scientifically effective program.  
 ISMB enables intensified community involvement and bolsters its reputation as the leading conference in the field, with the strongest scientific and technical program that showcases the best international developments in bioinformatics and computational biology.

 ECCO XXXVI CONFERENCE MAY 2023   
 By DRC   
 “ The Structure of Mean-Variance and Max Entropy Frontiers In Portfolio Optimization”  authored by professors Yiannis Dimoticalis and Takis Varelas was presented by Yiannis in the6 th  Conference of the European Chapter on Combinatorial Optimization be held in Chania, Crete, Greece, from Thursday 11 th  to Sunday 14 th  May 2023. ECCO (European Chapter on Combinatorial Optimization) is a Working Group of EURO (Association of European Operational Research Societies)  that provides an excellent opportunity to discuss recent and important issues in Combinatorial Optimization and its applications.  
 The traditional Markowitz Mean–Variance method for optimizing a portfolio is based on risk (variance) minimization. The combinations of portfolio assets lead to the associated Mean-Variance frontier. The Max Entropy approach is based on maximizing entropy as a way to measure portfolio differentiation. Geometrically the structure of the Max Entropy frontier is similar to that of the Mean-Variation frontier. Both frontiers are the answer to a specific optimization problem with certain constrains. The cases of 2, 5, and 10 assets portfolios are used to show the similarities and differences of the two frontiers. The implications for portfolio managers are discussed using a new index for the Max Entropy frontier that is comparable to the Sharpe index of the Mean-Variance method.
