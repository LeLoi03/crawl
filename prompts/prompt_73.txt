 Not every article in a journal is considered primary research and therefore "citable", this chart shows the ratio of a journal's articles including substantial research (research articles, conference papers and reviews) in three year windows vs. those documents other than research articles, reviews and conference papers.

Call for Demonstrations  
 The European Conference on Information Retrieval is the prime European forum for the presentation of original research in the field of Information Retrieval.  
 ECIR 2023 is seeking original, high-quality submissions addressing innovative research in the broad field Information Retrieval. ECIR 2023 wishes to highlight significant contributions addressing the main challenges of providing effective search and retrieval, but also the related and equally important issues of multimedia and multi-modal content management, user interaction, large-scale search, machine learning, and societal and technical challenges.  
 Topics of Interest  
 ECIR 2023 encourages the submission of high-quality and original papers on the theory experimentation, and practice of information retrieval and interaction; this primarily includes textual information but could also include visual audio, and multi-modal information. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:  
 User aspects | , including information interaction, contextualisation personalisation, simulation, characterisation, and behaviours; 
  System and foundational aspects | , including retrieval models and architectures, content analysis and classification, recommendation algorithms, query processing and ranking, efficiency and scalability; 
  New social and technical challenges | , such as bias, ethics, fake news and hate speech, wearable devices and neuroinformatics. 
 Demonstration Paper Track  
 The Demo track  provides the opportunity for researchers to present their research prototypes and operational systems which they wish to share with the community, obtain feedback from experts, and exchange knowledge on implementing and developing such systems.  
 Submissions should clearly define their purpose, scope, and audience of the demo. 
  Demo papers are up to | 4 pages in length | plus additional pages for references. Appendices count toward the pagelimit. 
  Demo papers will be refereed through | single-blind peer review | (demo submissions are not anonymous). 
  Submission Guidelines  
 In addition, the corresponding author of each accepted paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the paper has been submitted, changes relating to its authorship cannot be made.  
 Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. The proceedings will be distributed to all delegates at the conference. Accepted papers will have to be presented at the conference – and at least one author will be required to register. ECIR intends to publish the proceedings as open access if sufficient funding is acquired.  
 Dual submission policy  
 Papers submitted to ECIR 2022 should be substantially different from papers that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that are under review at other venues. Exceptions to this rule are:  
 Submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings. 
  Submission is permitted for papers that have previously been made available as a technical report (e.g., in institutional archives or preprint archives like arXiv). However, we discourage this since it places anonymity at risk; in particular, please do not publish your paper at arXiv and submit to ECIR at the same time, some days before, or during the reviewing period of ECIR. 
  If your paper already is available as a technical report: | You might not want to use the exact same title and abstract for your ECIR submission (in case of acceptance at ECIR, the title of your submission still might be changed “back”). 
  Please do not cite your technical report and make some effort to avoid any issues that may harm the double-blindness of your submission. Reviewers will receive guidance that ask them to refrain from trying to break blindness if at all possible too, but be aware that the availability of an available technical report for an ECIR submission can cause issues. 
  Ethics and professional conduct  
 ECIR 2023 expects authors (as well as the PC, and the organizing committee) to adhere to accepted standards on ethics and professionalism, such as:  
 The | ACM's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct | , 
  The | ACM's Conflict of Interest Policy | . 
  The | ACM's Policy Against Harassment | . 
  or similar other standards of professional conduct.
