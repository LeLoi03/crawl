 The 2023 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Network Analysis and Mining   
 Welcome to ASONAM 2023  
  The photos from ASONAM 2023 are avaiable here     
  Good news: ASONAM has been included in CORE     
  For more than a century, social networks have been studied in a variety of disciplines including sociology, anthropology, psychology, and economics. The Internet, the social Web, and other large-scale, socio-technological infrastructures have triggered a growing interest and significant methodological advancements in social network analysis and mining. Method development in graph theory, statistics, data mining and machine learning, and statistical mechanics is inspired by new research problems and, in turn, opens up further possibilities for application. These spiraling trends have led to a rising prominence of social network analysis and mining methods and tools in academia, politics, security, and business.  
  The international conference series on Advances in Social Network Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2023) provides an interdisciplinary venue that brings together researchers and practitioners from a broad variety of fields to promote collaborations and exchange of ideas and practices. ASONAM 2023 is intended to address important aspects with a specific focus on emerging trends and industry needs. The conference solicits empirical, experimental, methodological, and theoretical research reporting original and unpublished results on social network analysis and mining along with applications.

 ASOR 2022  
 Due to the proximity of APORS 2022 and MODSIM/ASOR 2023, ASOR will be holding a workshop-style conference in late 2022, rather than a conference made up of presentations. More information to come.  
 MODSIM/ASOR 2023  
 Past Conferences  
 ASOR is a member of IFORS, through the Asia-Pacific OR Societies (APORS).  
  ASOR will once again offer a Student Presentation Prize for the ASOR/DORS stream at the conference. Students, please do make sure we know you are in contention, by emailing info@asor.org   before the conference. We are good, but not perfect, at identifying who is and isn't a student based on the conference program. Three aspects with equal weight - presentation style, presentation structure, and presentation scientific/technical content - will form the basis of our selection of prize winner.
