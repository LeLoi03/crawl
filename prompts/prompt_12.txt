 AIME 2023. Last Call for Papers  
 21st International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine  
  June 13-14, 2023. Portoroz, Slovenia  
 The AIME 2023 conference invites all interested researchers to submit original contributions regarding the development of theory, methods, systems, and applications of AI in biomedicine, including the application of AI approaches in biomedical informatics, healthcare organisation and molecular medicine.  
 IMPORTANT DATES  
  Abstract submission deadline: January 15, 2023  
  Paper submission deadline: February 1, 2023  
  Notification of acceptance: March 10, 2023  
  Camera-ready submission deadline: March 17, 2023  
  Main conference: June 13-14, 2023  
  Updates on Twitter @AIMEconference  
 Contributions to theory and methods should present or analyse novel AI theories or methodologies for solving problems in the biomedical field. They may propose new theories and methods or extensions of existing ones. In both cases, the work should demonstrate its utility for solving biomedical problems and highlight its contribution to the underlying theoretical basis. In addition, it should discuss assumptions, limitations, and novelty with respect to the state of the art.  
 Contributions addressing systems and applications should describe the development, implementation or evaluation of innovative, AI-based tools and systems in the biomedical application domain. These papers should both link the work to underlying theory and either analyse the potential benefits to solve biomedical problems or present empirical evidence of benefits in clinical practice.  
 AWARDS  
  AIME Rising Star award is aimed at young researchers with recent breakthrough papers in the area.
