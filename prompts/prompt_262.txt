 Submission Guidlines  
 Paper types | When writing or evaluating a SoCG paper, it is important to keep in mind that there are different types of contributions, each with its own strengths. To ensure that a submission is evaluated on its own merits, authors will need to identify the main strengths of their submission, as captured by four possible paper types. PC members and external reviewers will be asked to take into account these paper types together with their associated evaluation criteria when they evaluate a paper. There are no quotas for the paper types and submissions can be labeled with more than one paper type at the time of submission. 
  Mathematical Foundations | : A typical paper will contain theorems and proofs describing new results in discrete or combinatorial geometry, discrete differential geometry or topology, or in topological combinatorics. The paper will primarily be evaluated on its technical depth, the importance of the results, the elegance of the solution, the connection of the problem studied to computational geometry and topology, and the potential future impact on algorithm development. 
  Algorithmic Complexity | : A typical paper will contain algorithms, data structures, theorems, proofs, or lower bound constructions describing new results on computational geometry problems. The paper will primarily be evaluated on the (mathematical or computational) relevance and importance of the problem studied, its technical depth, the elegance of the solution, and the potential future impact of the results or the proposed new methods and techniques. 
  Experiments and Implementation | : A typical paper will make a clear contribution to the implementation and evaluation of geometric algorithms, such as exact, approximate, or algebraic computation, algorithms engineering, or the experimental evaluation of competing algorithmic approaches. The paper will primarily be evaluated on the completeness and the expected impact of the proposed implementation, the soundness of the experiments, the quality and quantity of testing, and on the general amount of knowledge gained. 
  Applications | : A typical paper will describe the modeling and algorithmic choices made when developing or adapting computational geometry techniques for an application area. The paper will be primarily evaluated on the soundness of the modeling decisions, the ingenuity of the solution, the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the expected impact in the application area. One might also consider the lesson learned regarding the applicability or suitability of computational geometry tools to the specific area. 
  Contents of the submission | Papers should be submitted in the form of an extended abstract, which begins with the title of the paper, as well as a short abstract. This should be followed by the main body of the paper that begins with a precise statement of the problem considered, a succinct summary of the results obtained (emphasizing the significance, novelty, and potential impact of the research), and a clear comparison with related work. The remainder of the extended abstract should provide sufficient details to allow the program committee to evaluate the validity, quality, and relevance of the contribution. Clarity of presentation is very important; the entire extended abstract should be written carefully, taking into consideration that it will be read and evaluated by both experts and non-experts, often under tight time constraints. 
  Previous or simultaneous submission | Previous or simultaneous submissions Results previously published or accepted for publication in the proceedings of another conference cannot be submitted. Simultaneous submissions of the results to another conference with published proceedings are not allowed. Exempted are workshops and conferences without formal proceedings, but possibly with handouts containing short abstracts. In particular, submissions of papers that have appeared or will be submitted to EuroCG are allowed, since EuroCG does not publish formal proceedings, while submissions of papers that have appeared in CCCG are not allowed. Results that have already been accepted (with or without revision) for publication in a journal at the time of their submission to the symposium are not allowed. 
  Strict guidelines | Submissions deviating from the above guidelines risk being rejected without further consideration. 
  Guidelines for reviewers | The guidelines are available | here | . 
  Accepted Papers  
 Presentation, awards, and special issues | An author of each accepted paper will be expected to attend the symposium and present the paper (approximately 20 minutes). Given the developing COVID-19 pandemic, the format of both attendance and presentation will be clarified closer to the event. Awards will be given for the best paper and for the best student presentation. Authors of a selection of papers from the symposium will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers to special issues of | Discrete & Computational Geometry | and | Journal of Computational Geometry | . As in the previous years, the authors of the best paper will be invited to submit an extended version of their paper to | Journal of the ACM | .

  Abstract    
 Designing coresets - small-space sketches of the data preserving cost of the solutions within (1± ε)-approximate factor - is an important research direction in the study of center-based k-clustering problems, such as k-means or k-median. Feldman and Langberg [STOC'11] have shown that for k-clustering of n points in general metrics, it is possible to obtain coresets whose size depends logarithmically in n. Moreover, such a dependency in n is inevitable in general metrics. A significant amount of recent work in the area is devoted to obtaining coresests whose sizes are independent of n for special metrics, like d-dimensional Euclidean space [Huang, Vishnoi, STOC'20], doubling metrics [Huang, Jiang, Li, Wu, FOCS'18], metrics of graphs of bounded treewidth [Baker, Braverman, Huang, Jiang, Krauthgamer, Wu, ICML’20], or graphs excluding a fixed minor [Braverman, Jiang, Krauthgamer, Wu, SODA’21]. In this paper, we provide the first constructions of coresets whose size does not depend on n for k-clustering in the metrics induced by geometric intersection graphs. For example, we obtain (k log²k)/ε^𝒪(1) size coresets for k-clustering in Euclidean-weighted unit-disk graphs (UDGs) and unit-square graphs (USGs). These constructions follow from a general theorem that identifies two canonical properties of a graph metric sufficient for obtaining coresets whose size is independent of n. The proof of our theorem builds on the recent work of Cohen-Addad, Saulpic, and Schwiegelshohn [STOC '21], which ensures small-sized coresets conditioned on the existence of an interesting set of centers, called centroid set. The main technical contribution of our work is the proof of the existence of such a small-sized centroid set for graphs that satisfy the two canonical properties. Loosely speaking, the metrics of geometric intersection graphs are "similar" to the Euclidean metrics for points that are close, and to the shortest path metrics of planar graphs for points that are far apart. The main technical challenge in constructing centroid sets of small sizes is in combining these two very different metrics. The new coreset construction helps to design the first (1+ε)-approximation for center-based clustering problems in UDGs and USGs, that is fixed-parameter tractable in k and ε (FPT-AS).

  Abstract    
 In this paper we give a new, efficient algorithm for computing curve skeletons, based on local separators. Our efficiency stems from a multilevel approach, where we solve small problems across levels of detail and combine these in order to quickly obtain a skeleton. We do this in a highly modular fashion, ensuring complete flexibility in adapting the algorithm for specific types of input or for otherwise targeting specific applications. Separator based skeletonization was first proposed by Bærentzen and Rotenberg in [ACM Tran. Graphics'21], showing high quality output at the cost of running times which become prohibitive for large inputs. Our new approach retains the high quality output, and applicability to any spatially embedded graph, while being orders of magnitude faster for all practical purposes. We test our skeletonization algorithm for efficiency and quality in practice, comparing it to local separator skeletonization on the University of Groningen Skeletonization Benchmark [Telea'16].

  Abstract    
 Clearing is a simple but effective optimization for the standard algorithm of persistent homology (ph), which dramatically improves the speed and scalability of ph computations for Vietoris-Rips filtrations. Due to the quick growth of the boundary matrices of a Vietoris-Rips filtration with increasing dimension, clearing is only effective when used in conjunction with a dual (cohomological) variant of the standard algorithm. This approach has not previously been applied successfully to the computation of two-parameter ph. We introduce a cohomological algorithm for computing minimal free resolutions of two-parameter ph that allows for clearing. To derive our algorithm, we extend the duality principles which underlie the one-parameter approach to the two-parameter setting. We provide an implementation and report experimental run times for function-Rips filtrations. Our method is faster than the current state-of-the-art by a factor of up to 20.

  Abstract    
 A geometric t-spanner for a set S of n point sites is an edge-weighted graph for which the (weighted) distance between any two sites p,q ∈ S is at most t times the original distance between p and q. We study geometric t-spanners for point sets in a constrained two-dimensional environment P. In such cases, the edges of the spanner may have non-constant complexity. Hence, we introduce a novel spanner property: the spanner complexity, that is, the total complexity of all edges in the spanner. Let S be a set of n point sites in a simple polygon P with m vertices. We present an algorithm to construct, for any constant ε > 0 and fixed integer k ≥ 1, a (2k + ε)-spanner with complexity O(mn^{1/k} + nlog² n) in O(nlog²n + mlog n + K) time, where K denotes the output complexity. When we consider sites in a polygonal domain P with holes, we can construct such a (2k+ε)-spanner of similar complexity in O(n² log m + nmlog m + K) time. Additionally, for any constant ε ∈ (0,1) and integer constant t ≥ 2, we show a lower bound for the complexity of any (t-ε)-spanner of Ω(mn^{1/(t-1)} + n).

  Abstract    
 The task of finding an extension to a given partial drawing of a graph while adhering to constraints on the representation has been extensively studied in the literature, with well-known results providing efficient algorithms for fundamental representations such as planar and beyond-planar topological drawings. In this paper, we consider the extension problem for bend-minimal orthogonal drawings of planar graphs, which is among the most fundamental geometric graph drawing representations. While the problem was known to be NP-hard, it is natural to consider the case where only a small part of the graph is still to be drawn. Here, we establish the fixed-parameter tractability of the problem when parameterized by the size of the missing subgraph. Our algorithm is based on multiple novel ingredients which intertwine geometric and combinatorial arguments. These include the identification of a new graph representation of bend-equivalent regions for vertex placement in the plane, establishing a bound on the treewidth of this auxiliary graph, and a global point-grid that allows us to discretize the possible placement of bends and vertices into locally bounded subgrids for each of the above regions.

  Abstract    
 In SoCG 2022, Conroy and Tóth presented several constructions of sparse, low-hop spanners in geometric intersection graphs, including an O(nlog n)-size 3-hop spanner for n disks (or fat convex objects) in the plane, and an O(nlog² n)-size 3-hop spanner for n axis-aligned rectangles in the plane. Their work left open two major questions: (i) can the size be made closer to linear by allowing larger constant stretch? and (ii) can near-linear size be achieved for more general classes of intersection graphs? We address both questions simultaneously, by presenting new constructions of constant-hop spanners that have almost linear size and that hold for a much larger class of intersection graphs. More precisely, we prove the existence of an O(1)-hop spanner for arbitrary string graphs with O(nα_k(n)) size for any constant k, where α_k(n) denotes the k-th function in the inverse Ackermann hierarchy. We similarly prove the existence of an O(1)-hop spanner for intersection graphs of d-dimensional fat objects with O(nα_k(n)) size for any constant k and d. We also improve on some of Conroy and Tóth’s specific previous results, in either the number of hops or the size: we describe an O(nlog n)-size 2-hop spanner for disks (or more generally objects with linear union complexity) in the plane, and an O(nlog n)-size 3-hop spanner for axis-aligned rectangles in the plane. Our proofs are all simple, using separator theorems, recursion, shifted quadtrees, and shallow cuttings.

  Abstract    
 Consider a weighted, undirected graph cellularly embedded on a topological surface. The function assigning to each free homotopy class of closed curves the length of a shortest cycle within this homotopy class is called the marked length spectrum. The (unmarked) length spectrum is obtained by just listing the length values of the marked length spectrum in increasing order. In this paper, we describe algorithms for computing the (un)marked length spectra of graphs embedded on the torus. More specifically, we preprocess a weighted graph of complexity n in time O(n² log log n) so that, given a cycle with 𝓁 edges representing a free homotopy class, the length of a shortest homotopic cycle can be computed in O(𝓁+log n) time. Moreover, given any positive integer k, the first k values of its unmarked length spectrum can be computed in time O(k log n). Our algorithms are based on a correspondence between weighted graphs on the torus and polyhedral norms. In particular, we give a weight independent bound on the complexity of the unit ball of such norms. As an immediate consequence we can decide if two embedded weighted graphs have the same marked spectrum in polynomial time. We also consider the problem of comparing the unmarked spectra and provide a polynomial time algorithm in the unweighted case and a randomized polynomial time algorithm otherwise.

  Abstract    
 This paper exhibits and analyzes an algorithm that takes a given closed orientable hyperbolic surface and outputs an explicit Dirichlet domain. The input is a fundamental polygon with side pairings. While grounded in topological considerations, the algorithm makes key use of the geometry of the surface. We introduce data structures that reflect this interplay between geometry and topology and show that the algorithm runs in polynomial time, in terms of the initial perimeter and the genus of the surface.

  Abstract    
 A finite set P of points in the plane is n-universal with respect to a class 𝒞 of planar graphs if every n-vertex graph in 𝒞 admits a crossing-free straight-line drawing with vertices at points of P. For the class of all planar graphs the best known upper bound on the size of a universal point set is quadratic and the best known lower bound is linear in n. Some classes of planar graphs are known to admit universal point sets of near linear size, however, there are no truly linear bounds for interesting classes beyond outerplanar graphs. In this paper, we show that there is a universal point set of size 2n-2 for the class of bipartite planar graphs with n vertices. The same point set is also universal for the class of n-vertex planar graphs of maximum degree 3. The point set used for the results is what we call an exploding double chain, and we prove that this point set allows planar straight-line embeddings of many more planar graphs, namely of all subgraphs of planar graphs admitting a one-sided Hamiltonian cycle. The result for bipartite graphs also implies that every n-vertex plane graph has a 1-bend drawing all whose bends and vertices are contained in a specific point set of size 4n-6, this improves a bound of 6n-10 for the same problem by Löffler and Tóth.

  Abstract    
 The Hilbert metric is a distance function defined for points lying within a convex body. It generalizes the Cayley-Klein model of hyperbolic geometry to any convex set, and it has numerous applications in the analysis and processing of convex bodies. In this paper, we study the geometric and combinatorial properties of the Voronoi diagram of a set of point sites under the Hilbert metric. Given any m-sided convex polygon Ω in the plane, we present two randomized incremental algorithms and one deterministic algorithm. The first randomized algorithm and the deterministic algorithm compute the Voronoi diagram of a set of n point sites. The second randomized algorithm extends this to compute the Voronoi diagram of the set of n sites, each of which may be a point or a line segment. Our algorithms all run in expected time O(m n log n). The algorithms use O(m n) storage, which matches the worst-case combinatorial complexity of the Voronoi diagram in the Hilbert metric.

  Abstract    
 The (combinatorial) graph Laplacian is a fundamental object in the analysis of, and optimization on, graphs. Via a topological view, this operator can be extended to a simplicial complex K and therefore offers a way to perform "signal processing" on p-(co)chains of K. Recently, the concept of persistent Laplacian was proposed and studied for a pair of simplicial complexes K ↪ L connected by an inclusion relation, further broadening the use of Laplace-based operators. In this paper, we significantly expand the scope of the persistent Laplacian by generalizing it to a pair of weighted simplicial complexes connected by a weight preserving simplicial map f: K → L. Such a simplicial map setting arises frequently, e.g., when relating a coarsened simplicial representation with an original representation, or the case when the two simplicial complexes are spanned by different point sets, i.e. cases in which it does not hold that K ⊂ L. However, the simplicial map setting is much more challenging than the inclusion setting since the underlying algebraic structure is much more complicated. We present a natural generalization of the persistent Laplacian to the simplicial setting. To shed insight on the structure behind it, as well as to develop an algorithm to compute it, we exploit the relationship between the persistent Laplacian and the Schur complement of a matrix. A critical step is to view the Schur complement as a functorial way of restricting a self-adjoint positive semi-definite operator to a given subspace. As a consequence of this relation, we prove that the qth persistent Betti number of the simplicial map f: K → L equals the nullity of the qth persistent Laplacian Δ_q^{K,L}. We then propose an algorithm for finding the matrix representation of Δ_q^{K,L} which in turn yields a fundamentally different algorithm for computing the qth persistent Betti number of a simplicial map. Finally, we study the persistent Laplacian on simplicial towers under weight-preserving simplicial maps and establish monotonicity results for their eigenvalues.

  Abstract    
 Persistent homology has been widely used to study the topology of point clouds in ℝⁿ. Standard approaches are very sensitive to outliers, and their computational complexity depends badly on the number of data points. In this paper we introduce a novel persistence module for a point cloud using the theory of Christoffel-Darboux kernels. This module is robust to (statistical) outliers in the data, and can be computed in time linear in the number of data points. We illustrate the benefits and limitations of our new module with various numerical examples in ℝⁿ, for n = 1, 2, 3. Our work expands upon recent applications of Christoffel-Darboux kernels in the context of statistical data analysis and geometric inference [Lasserre et al., 2022]. There, these kernels are used to construct a polynomial whose level sets capture the geometry of a point cloud in a precise sense. We show that the persistent homology associated to the sublevel set filtration of this polynomial is stable with respect to the Wasserstein distance. Moreover, we show that the persistent homology of this filtration can be computed in singly exponential time in the ambient dimension n, using a recent algorithm of Basu & Karisani [Basu and Karisani, 2022].

  Abstract    
 A graph is 2-planar if it has local crossing number two, that is, it can be drawn in the plane such that every edge has at most two crossings. A graph is maximal 2-planar if no edge can be added such that the resulting graph remains 2-planar. A 2-planar graph on n vertices has at most 5n-10 edges, and some (maximal) 2-planar graphs - referred to as optimal 2-planar - achieve this bound. However, in strong contrast to maximal planar graphs, a maximal 2-planar graph may have fewer than the maximum possible number of edges. In this paper, we determine the minimum edge density of maximal 2-planar graphs by proving that every maximal 2-planar graph on n ≥ 5 vertices has at least 2n edges. We also show that this bound is tight, up to an additive constant. The lower bound is based on an analysis of the degree distribution in specific classes of drawings of the graph. The upper bound construction is verified by carefully exploring the space of admissible drawings using computer support.

  Abstract    
 Given a complete simple topological graph G, a k-face generated by G is the open bounded region enclosed by the edges of a non-self-intersecting k-cycle in G. Interestingly, there are complete simple topological graphs with the property that every odd face it generates contains the origin. In this paper, we show that every complete n-vertex simple topological graph generates at least Ω(n^{1/3}) pairwise disjoint 4-faces. As an immediate corollary, every complete simple topological graph on n vertices drawn in the unit square generates a 4-face with area at most O(n^{-1/3}). Finally, we investigate a ℤ₂ variant of Heilbronn’s triangle problem for not necessarily simple complete topological graphs.

  Abstract    
 We strengthen the usual stability theorem for Vietoris-Rips (VR) persistent homology of finite metric spaces by building upon constructions due to Usher and Zhang in the context of filtered chain complexes. The information present at the level of filtered chain complexes includes ephemeral points, i.e. points with zero persistence, which provide additional information to that present at homology level. The resulting invariant, called verbose barcode, which has a stronger discriminating power than the usual barcode, is proved to be stable under certain metrics which are sensitive to these ephemeral points. In some situations, we provide ways to compute such metrics between verbose barcodes. We also exhibit several examples of finite metric spaces with identical (standard) VR barcodes yet with different verbose VR barcodes thus confirming that these ephemeral points strengthen the discriminating power of the standard VR barcode.

  Abstract    
 The circular coordinates algorithm of de Silva, Morozov, and Vejdemo-Johansson takes as input a dataset together with a cohomology class representing a 1-dimensional hole in the data; the output is a map from the data into the circle that captures this hole, and that is of minimum energy in a suitable sense. However, when applied to several cohomology classes, the output circle-valued maps can be "geometrically correlated" even if the chosen cohomology classes are linearly independent. It is shown in the original work that less correlated maps can be obtained with suitable integer linear combinations of the cohomology classes, with the linear combinations being chosen by inspection. In this paper, we identify a formal notion of geometric correlation between circle-valued maps which, in the Riemannian manifold case, corresponds to the Dirichlet form, a bilinear form derived from the Dirichlet energy. We describe a systematic procedure for constructing low energy torus-valued maps on data, starting from a set of linearly independent cohomology classes. We showcase our procedure with computational examples. Our main algorithm is based on the Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovász algorithm from computational number theory.

  Abstract    
 A finite point set in ℝ^d is in general position if no d + 1 points lie on a common hyperplane. Let α_d(N) be the largest integer such that any set of N points in ℝ^d with no d + 2 members on a common hyperplane, contains a subset of size α_d(N) in general position. Using the method of hypergraph containers, Balogh and Solymosi showed that α₂(N) < N^{5/6 + o(1)}. In this paper, we also use the container method to obtain new upper bounds for α_d(N) when d ≥ 3. More precisely, we show that if d is odd, then α_d(N) < N^{1/2 + 1/(2d) + o(1)}, and if d is even, we have α_d(N) < N^{1/2 + 1/(d-1) + o(1)}. We also study the classical problem of determining the maximum number a(d,k,n) of points selected from the grid [n]^d such that no k + 2 members lie on a k-flat. For fixed d and k, we show that a(d,k,n)≤ O(n^{d/{2⌊(k+2)/4⌋}(1- 1/{2⌊(k+2)/4⌋d+1})}), which improves the previously best known bound of O(n^{d/⌊(k + 2)/2⌋}) due to Lefmann when k+2 is congruent to 0 or 1 mod 4.

  Abstract    
 This work describes the winning implementation of the CG:SHOP 2023 Challenge. The topic of the Challenge was the convex cover problem: given a polygon P (with holes), find a minimum-cardinality set of convex polygons whose union equals P. We use a three-step approach: (1) Create a suitable partition of P. (2) Compute a visibility graph of the pieces of the partition. (3) Solve a vertex clique cover problem on the visibility graph, from which we then derive the convex cover. This way we capture the geometric difficulty in the first step and the combinatorial difficulty in the third step.

 The 16th International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS)   
 Aquapalace Hotel Prague, Czech Republic   
 July 14 - July 16, 2023 (just after ICAPS)   
 Heuristic search and other forms of combinatorial search optimization are a very active areas of research in artificial intelligence, robotics, planning, discrete optimization and other areas of computer science and operations research. The International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS) is meant to bring researchers in such areas together to exchange their ideas and cross-fertilize the field.   
 SoCS serves researchers and submissions in all fields that use combinatorial search, including artificial intelligence, planning, robotics, constraint programming, meta-reasoning, operations research, navigation and bioinformatics. We especially invite submissions presenting real-world applications of heuristic search.   
 SoCS 2023 will take place at  Aquapalace Hotel Prague   that offers a modern and technologically advanced conference center with a fast and stable internet connection. Its connection with the water park creates a completely unique experience.   
 The conference already obtained funding from NSF and AIJ for supporting student participation at SoCS 2023.
