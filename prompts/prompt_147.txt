  11th ACM/IEEE International Workshop on Software Engineering for Systems-of-Systems and Software Ecosystems   
 (SESoS 2023)   
 Hybrid Workshop Announcement    
 The ICSE organizing team will support SESoS 2023 to be held as a hybrid workshop  based on a moderately effective Zoom session for the duration allowing remote presenting/interaction. We encourage authors and other participants to attend SESoS and ICSE for in-person interactions in Melbourne, but authors will be allowed to register for the workshop and do virtual presentations on the workshop date (May 14th, 2023).   
 The 11th International Workshop on Software Engineering for Systems-of-Systems and Software Ecosystems (SESoS 2023) provides researchers and practitioners with a forum to exchange ideas and experiences, analyze research and development issues, discuss promising solutions, and propose theoretical foundations for development and evolution of complex software-intensive systems, inspiring visions for the future of Software Engineering for Systems-of-Systems (SoS) and Software Ecosystems (SECO), as well as paving the way for a more structured community effort.  
 SoS have become increasingly complex and frequently used in highly distributed, dynamic, and open environments. SoS refer to evolving software systems in which constituent systems (themselves systems in their own right) cooperatively work to fulfill specific, complex missions, facing Software Engineering researchers and practitioners with substantial challenges. SECO have also become an important research topic, addressing social issues along with technical aspects of software development. SoS and SECO are closely related and naturally distributed in development teams. In both fields, distributed resources aim at reducing cost and reaching new Information Technology markets. Software Engineering-related problems and challenges are amplified and become more critical when SoS and SECO are analyzed together.  
 NEWS   
 Authors of the best regular papers of SESoS 2023 will be awarded in the workshop closing session and invited to submit extended versions of their works to a Special Issue in Journal of Software: Evolution and Process   .

Submissions should clearly state how they are novel and how they improve upon existing work.  
 We will employ a double-blind review process. Thus, no submission may reveal its authors’ identities. The authors must make every effort to honor the double-blind review process. In particular, the authors’ names must be omitted from the submission and references to their prior work should be in the third person.  
 Submission Instructions All submissions must conform to the ICSE 2023 formatting and submission instructions. All submissions must be in PDF. We invite submissions of papers of the following types:  
 Research papers (8 pages inc. references): technical research, experience reports, empirical studies, etc. Position papers (2 pages inc. references): well-argued position or work in progress. Submissions must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options).  
 The official publication date of the workshop proceedings is the date the proceedings are made available by IEEE. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of ICSE 2023. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME)  
  - Resources site - 
 The ICSM conference is the premier international (world wide) event in the maintenance field. The importance of software maintenance is being increasingly recognised, both in terms of professional activities and of public perception (the Y2K Millennium bug and the Euro-conversion being the most obvious examples). Hence it is vital for the community of researchers and practitioners to publish, present, and debate the latest results in the field. The ICSM proceedings present works of outstanding international excellence, where reports on the latest advances in the field may be found.  
 Previous ICSM conferences demonstrated tremendous interest and enthusiasm on the part of both researchers and applications personnel for current work in software maintenance. Many excellent papers were submitted and debated, showing that there is increasing interest in the subject.  
 ICSM is truly an international meeting place for researchers and practitioners in the field. Members of the program committee represent many different countries of the world. Many of the authors of papers also represent the software engineering interests of the international community. A main goal of ICSM is to promote interaction between researchers and practitioners. ICSM will bring together researchers, practitioners, developers and users of tools, technology transfer experts, and project managers.  
 Beware of other conferences that call themselves International Conference on Software Maintenance (ICSM), which are not IEEE sponsored or affiliated with ICSME.
