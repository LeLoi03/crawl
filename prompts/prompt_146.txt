 The International Conference on Software Architecture (ICSA) is the premier venue for practitioners and researchers interested in software architecture, in component-based software engineering and in quality aspects of software and how these relate to the design of software architectures. ICSA has a strong tradition as a working conference (previously named Working International Conference on Software Architecture, WICSA), where researchers meet practitioners and software architects can explain the problems they face in their day-to-day work and try to influence the future of the field.  
 On this web site you can find information about the ICSA conference series as well as useful information for organizing a future ICSA conference. We also provide information about the history of ICSA and its predecessor conferences, WICSA, CBSE, and QoSA,  on awards for most influential papers of past instances of ICSA  and a hall of fame of past best papers and best reviewers.

  Call for Papers 
  DeepTest  is a high-quality workshop for research at the intersection of Machine Learning (ML) and software engineering (SE). ML is widely adopted in modern software systems, including safety-critical domains such as autonomous cars, medical diagnosis, and aircraft collision avoidance systems. Thus, it is crucial to rigorously test such applications to ensure high dependability. However, standard notions of software quality and reliability become irrelevant when considering ML systems, due to their non-deterministic nature and the lack of a transparent understanding of the models’ semantics. ML is also expected to revolutionize software development. Indeed, ML is being applied for devising novel program analysis and software testing techniques related to malware detection, fuzzy testing, bug-finding, and type-checking.  
 The workshop will combine academia and industry in a quest for well-founded practical solutions. The aim is to bring together an international group of researchers and practitioners with both ML and SE backgrounds to discuss their research, share datasets, and generally help the field build momentum. The workshop will consist of invited talks, presentations based on research paper submissions, and one or more panel discussions, where all participants are invited to share their insights and ideas.

 Call for Papers  
 NOTICE (09 Jan 2023)  : Only those who submitted by the original deadline (January 13, 2023) will be given one more week  to update their submitted papers. Please note that no new submissions will be accepted after the original deadline.   
 DeepTest is an interdisciplinary workshop targeting research at the intersection of software engineering and deep learning. This workshop will explore issues related to:  
 Deep Learning applied to Software Engineering (DL4SE) 
 Full research papers | up to 8-page papers (including references) describing original and unpublished results related to the workshop topics; 
  Short papers | up to 4-page papers (including references) describing both preliminary work, new insights in previous work, or demonstrations of testing-related tools and prototypes. 
  All submissions must conform to the ICSE 2023 formatting instructions. All submissions must be in PDF. The page limit is strict.  
 Submissions must conform to the IEEE formatting instructions IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}  without including the compsoc  or compsocconf  options).  
 DeepTest 2023 will employ a double-blind  review process. Thus, no submission may reveal its authors’ identities. The authors must make every effort to honor the double-blind review process. In particular, the authors’ names must be omitted from the submission, and references to their prior work should be in the third person.  
 The official publication date of accepted papers is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM or IEEE Digital Libraries. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of ICSE 2023. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. Purchases of additional pages in the proceedings is not allowed.  
 If you have any questions or wonder whether your submission is in scope, please do not hesitate to contact the organizers.  
 Important Dates   
 Paper Submission: January 13, 2023 (AoE) | (NEW: You can update your submitted papers until January 20  only if the initial submission is made before January 13) 
  Acceptance Notification: February 24, 2023 (AoE) 
  Camera Ready: March 17, 2023 (AoE)

 Keynotes  
 DeepTest 2023 will feature two keynotes from the following distinguished speakers.  
 Keynote 1 - Testing Autonomous Driving Systems   
 Speaker   
 Baishakhi Ray  | Associate Professor, Columbia University  
 Abstract   
 Recent years have seen rapid progress in Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs). To ensure the safety and reliability of these systems, extensive testing is required. However, direct testing on the road is incredibly expensive and unrealistic to cover all critical scenarios. A popular alternative is to evaluate an ADS’s performance in some well-designed challenging scenarios, a.k.a. scenario-based testing. Such test cases must possess several desirable properties (e.g., failure-inducing, realistic, etc.) to be useful. However, the search space of such test cases can be huge due to the temporal nature of traffic scenarios. In this talk, I will cover our recent efforts in efficiently generating testing scenarios: 1) AutoFuzz, a grammar-based, learning-guided black-box fuzzing technique to generate failure-inducing scenarios for ADSs; 2) FusED, an evolutionary and causality-based domain-specific grey-box fuzzing framework to generate failure-inducing scenarios for fusion component of ADSs; and 3) CTG, a Signal Temporal Logic (STL) guided conditional diffusion model that generates realistic and user-controllable scenarios for ADSs.

 Keynote 2 - Testing Generative Large Language Model: Mission Impossible or Where Lies the Path?   
 Speaker   
 Zhenchang Xing  | Associate Professor, Australian National University  
 Abstract   
 OpenAI’s ChatGPT, a generative language model, has attracted widespread attention from industry, academia, and the public for its impressive natural language processing capabilities. Although we know how to train such generative language models, we do not know how these models can solve such a diverse range of open-ended tasks. Every time we “prompt program” a large language model to complete a task, we create a customized version of the language model, which exhibits different abilities and outputs than other customized versions. Some people believe that the emergent capabilities of large language models are turning AI from engineering into natural science, as it is hard to think of these models as being designed for a specific purpose in the traditional sense. As our focus shifts from ensuring design and construction correctness to trying to explore and understand un-designed AI products and behaviors, we need to consider the methodological challenges posed by this transformation. For example, will differential testing, metamorphic testing, and adversarial testing, which are effective for testing discriminative models in specific tasks, no longer be the saviors of open-ended task testing for large language models? How can we test and correct ethical issues and hallucinations in generative AI? Due to the emergent capabilities of large language models, which are customized through in-context learning, will we face similar problems to the Schrödinger’s cat problem in quantum physics? If observation and measurement have a fundamental impact on the observed object, can we still fully test the essence of large language models, or can we only test the appearances of a specific customized version? Large language models are changing the way humans interact with AI, what adjustments do we need to make to our existing data and algorithm-centric MLOps? There may be many unknown problems. In this talk, I will share my thoughts (or even confusion) on these questions and some thoughts of actions (likely be wrong), hoping to inspire the community to explore the feasibility and methodology of testing generative large language models.
