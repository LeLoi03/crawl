  Download KR Whova App  Welcome to the 20 th  International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR2023), which will be held in Rhodes, Greece, in September 2-8, 2023.  
 Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR)  is a well-established and lively field of research. In KR a fundamental assumption is that an agent’s knowledge is explicitly represented in a declarative form, suitable for processing by dedicated reasoning engines. This assumption, that much of what an agent deals with is knowledge-based, is common in many modern intelligent systems. Consequently, KR has contributed to the theory and practice of various areas in AI, including automated planning and natural language understanding, and to fields beyond AI, including databases, verification, software engineering, and robotics. In recent years, KR has contributed also to new and emerging fields, including the semantic web, computational biology, cyber security, and the development of software agents.  
 The KR conference series is the leading forum for timely in-depth presentation of progress in the theory and principles underlying the representation and computational management of knowledge.

 Abstract  
 Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR) is a well-established and lively field of research. In KR a fundamental assumption is that an agent’s knowledge is explicitly represented in a declarative form, suitable for processing by dedicated reasoning engines. This assumption, that much of what an agent deals with is knowledge-based, is common in many modern intelligent systems. Consequently, KR has contributed to the theory and practice of various areas in AI, including automated planning and natural language understanding, and to fields beyond AI, including databases, verification, software engineering, and robotics. In recent years, KR has contributed also to new and emerging fields, including the semantic web, computational biology, cyber security, and the development of software agents.

  The aim of the conference is to expand the discussion of research in Theoretical computer science, Artificial intelligence, Algorithm, Description logic and Knowledge representation and reasoning. It focuses on Theoretical computer science but the discussions also offer insight into other areas such as Computational complexity theory, Semantics (computer science) and Set (abstract data type). The Semantics (computer science) study which was featured in it aims to expound on the research in Programming language.  
 Artificial intelligence research featured in the conference incorporates concerns from various other topics such as Machine learning, Argumentation theory and Natural language processing. In addition to Algorithm research, Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning aims to explore topics under Calculus and Algebra. The study on Description logic presented is investigated in conjunction with research in Ontology (information science).  
 What are the most cited papers published at the conference?  
  Research areas of the most cited articles at Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning:  
 The published articles generally zeroe in on subjects such as Theoretical computer science, Artificial intelligence, Algorithm, Description logic and Knowledge representation and reasoning. The Theoretical computer science research tackled in the published articles is interrelated with Reasoning system which concerns subjects like Deductive reasoning. Aside from discussions in Artificial intelligence, the conference publications also deal with the subject of Machine learning which intersects with Range (mathematics) disciplines.  
 Papers citation over time  
 A key indicator for each conference is its effectiveness in reaching other researchers with the papers published at that venue.  
 Giuseppe De Giacomo | (29 papers) | published 4 papers at the last edition the same number as at the previous edition, 
  Carsten Lutz | (23 papers) | published 2 papers at the last edition the same number as at the previous edition, 
  Pierre Marquis | (22 papers) | published 1 paper at the last edition the same number as at the previous edition,

 Publication chance based on affiliation  
 The publication chance index shows the ratio of articles published by the best research institutions at the conference edition to all articles published within that conference. The best research institutions were selected based on the largest number of articles published during all editions of the conference.  
 Returning Authors Index  
 A very common phenomenon observed among researchers publishing scientific articles is the intentional selection of conferences they have already attended in the past. In particular, it is worth analyzing the case when the authors participate in the same conference from year to year.  
 The Returning Authors Index presented below illustrates the ratio of authors who participated in both a given as well as the previous edition of the conference in relation to all participants in a given year.

 Returning Institution Index

 The experience to innovation index  
 Our experience to innovation index was created to show a cross-section of the experience level of authors publishing at a conference. The index includes the authors publishing at the last edition of a conference  , grouped by total number of publications throughout their academic career (P) and the total number of citations of these publications ever received (C).  
 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups:  
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25),
