 Welcome to the 14th International Conference on Computational Creativity (ICCC' 2023)!   
 Computational creativity is the art, science, philosophy, and engineering of computational systems which, by taking on particular responsibilities, exhibit behaviors that unbiased observers would deem to be creative. As a field of research, this area is thriving, with progress in formalizing what it means for software to be creative, along with many exciting and valuable applications of creative software in the sciences, the arts, literature, gaming, and elsewhere.   
 ICCC' 23 will take place Monday, June 19 to Friday, June 23, 2023 at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada.

 ICCE2023 is planed to be held as a "in-person" event only at this moment.  
  This may change to a hybrid mode according to the situation.  
 The rapid advancement of technology and the changing landscape of education have led to significant changes in technology-enabled learning environments. This presentation will explore the impact of changing situations on mobile technology-enabled learning environments, with the speaker sharing insights as both a researcher and an instructor. The talk will cover the evolving distribution and adjustment of components in these environments, as well as changes in pedagogy before, during, and after the Covid-19 pandemic. Additionally, the speaker will highlight the emerging dominance of new technologies in Hong Kong and worldwide, and propose future research directions for mobile learning.

   Welcome from the Conference Chair  
 Welcome to ICCHP 24,  
 the 19th "International Conference on Computers Helping People with Special Needs"!  
 Last ICCHP was a great successful in-person event, and it showed that Covid-19 crisis was gradually becoming a thing of the past.  
 It was indeed a pleasure to see each other and engage fruitful discussions.  
 Following that memorable event, we are delighted to announce the 19th vibrant biennial conference, returning to our home in LINZ!  
 To make ICT more accessible and tailoring assistive technology and services to promote inclusion and participation in all aspects of society.  
 Nowadays, “everyone” uses various SNS on their smartphones, often with AI-driven recommendations.  
  However, even in this cutting-edge era, or perhaps because of it, various accessibility issues still persist.  
 To address and resolve such challenges, I am confident that ICCHP is the ideal platform. Here, you can find research companions, discuss your issues, and establish a global human network even more valuable than AI.  
 We warmly invite you to participate in this remarkable conference and share your ideas. We eagerly await your contributions and presence.  
 Come and get involved, develop your network!
