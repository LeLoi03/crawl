  Welcome to the ICMLA'23 Official Web Site     
  ICMLA'23 aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to present their latest achievements and innovations in the area of machine learning (ML).  
 The conference provides a leading international forum for the dissemination of original research in ML, with emphasis on applications as well as novel algorithms and systems. Following the success of previous ICMLA conferences, the conference aims to attract researchers and application developers from a wide range of ML related areas, and the recent emergence of Big Data processing brings an urgent need for machine learning to address these new challenges. The conference will cover both machine learning theoretical research and its applications. Contributions describing machine learning techniques applied to real-world problems and interdisciplinary research involving machine learning, in fields like medicine, biology, industry, manufacturing, security, education, virtual environments, games, are especially encouraged.  
 Accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xplore’s scope and quality requirements. The conference is technically co-sponsored by IEEE.  
 It is planned that ICMLA'23 will be organized as in pre-pandemics time, with participants attending the conference in person, unless Covid rules will change towards the end of the year and this will not be possible. However, facilities will be in place so that people can attend and present their papers online, although we encourage in-person attendance.

 Contributions describing applications of machine learning (ML)techniques to real-world problems, interdisciplinary research involving machine learning, experimental and/or theoretical studies yielding new insights into the design of ML systems, and papers describing development of new analytical frameworks that advance practical machine learning methods are especially encouraged.  
  The conference will include a number of interesting keynote plenary talks, which will be announced on the conference web site as arrangements are finalized. Previous invited speakers included numerous fellows of AMLA, AMIA, AAAS, AAAI, etc.  
 Paper Submission   
 High quality papers in all Machine Learning areas are solicited. Papers that present new directions in ML will receive careful reviews. Authors are expected to ensure that their final manuscripts are original and are not appearing in other publications. Paper should be limited to 8 pages and submitted in IEEE format (double column). Papers will be reviewed by the Program Committee on the basis of technical quality, originality, significance and clarity. All submissions will be handled electronically. Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings, as a hardcopy. Authors of the accepted papers need to present their papers at the conference. A selected number of accepted papers will be invited for possible inclusion, in an expanded and revised form, in some journal special issues.  
 ICMLA'23 Best Paper Award and ICMLA'23 Best Poster Award will be conferred at the conference to the authors of the best research paper and best poster presentation, respectively, based on the reviewers and Programme Committee recommendations.  
 Detailed instructions for submitting papers can be found at How to Submit    
 Important Dates:  
 The submission deadline for the main conference was postponed because of the many requests received from the previous participants. There will be no further delay or exception made.
