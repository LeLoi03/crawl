  Abstract:  We address the problem of vehicle detection and tracking for traffic monitoring in Smart City applications. We introduce a novel approach for vehicle tracking by simultaneous detection and viewpoint estimation. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is adapted to describe the vehicle’s motion when not only the pose of the object is measured, but also its viewpoint with respect to the camera. Specifically, we enhance the motion model with observations of the vehicle viewpoint jointly extracted by the detection step. The approach is evaluated on a novel and challenging dataset with different video sequences recorded at urban environments, which is released with the paper. Our experimental validation confirms that the integration of an EKF with both detections and viewpoint estimations results beneficial.

  Abstract:  The “NP-Complete” class gathers very significant practical problems such as Sat, Max-Sat, partitioning. There is not polynomial algorithm for the resolution of these problems. As a result, the interest in heuristics and meta-heuristics is still growing. In this paper, we present a very recent metaheuristic introduced to solve a 3-sat problem. This metaheuristic can be classified as an evolutionary algorithm. It is based on the process of bees' reproduction. We adapted it for the resolution of the Max-Sat problem. We tested it on a medical benchmark obtained from a data-mining problem that we translated into a Max-Sat problem.

  Abstract:  Tissue P systems with cell division is a computing model in the framework of Membrane Computing based on intercellular communication and cooperation between neurons. The ability of cell division allows us to obtain an exponential amount of cells in linear time and to design cellular solutions to NP -complete problems in polynomial time. In this paper we present a solution to the Subset Sum problem via a family of such devices. This is the first solution to a numerical NP -complete problem by using tissue P systems with cell division.

  Call for Papers 
  Committees 
 IWOCA 2023 will be a hybrid conference   with both online and onsite participants.  
  Authors of accepted papers are expected to give an onsite talk or an online talk.  
 The topics of interest include (but are not limited to) the following:  
  Ad Hoc, Dynamic and Evolving Networks 
  Foundations of Cloud Computing 
  Conference proceedings will be published in the ARCoSS subline of the Springer “Lecture Notes in Computer Science” series.  
  Papers of high quality will be invited to special issues of “Journal of Computer and System Sciences” and “Theoretical Computer Science”, devoted to IWOCA 2023.  
 Awards  
 Awards will be given to the best paper and the best student paper. To be eligible for the best student paper award, at least one of the paper authors must be a full-time student at the time of submission, and the student(s) must have made a significant contribution to the paper. The program committee may decline to make these awards or may split them.  
 Submission instructions  
 Authors are invited to submit high-quality manuscripts reporting original unpublished research in the topics related to the symposium. Simultaneous submission to other conferences or workshops with published proceedings is not allowed. It is required that each accepted paper be presented at the conference by one of its authors.  
 Submissions must be in the form of a single pdf file prepared using the LNCS latex templates and style files. Springer’s proceedings LaTeX templates are also available on Overleaf. Springer’s authors’ guidelines may be consulted here.  
 Each submission should consist of the main part of the paper, not exceeding 12 pages (including the title page and excluding the references), plus an optional clearly marked appendix (to be read at the discretion of the program committee). Any figure pertaining to the main part of the paper should be included therein (within the 12 page limit). The first page must include an indication of whether the paper is eligible for the best student paper award.  
 Papers are to be submitted electronically through EasyChair at the following link:
