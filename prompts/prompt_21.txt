 Adapting the Emobook Life Story Book App for Reminiscence Focused Music Therapy in Dementia Care: An Interdisciplinary Participatory Design Approach  
  Abstract   
 Life Story books are frequently employed to facilitate reminiscence interventions, but their use in music therapy remains limited in the scientific literature. There is a paucity of research detailing the design processes involved in this context. In contemporary music therapy, the effective integration of technology is a significant concern. This paper aims to report on the Participatory Design process used to adapt the Emobook Life Story Book App for a Reminiscence Music Therapy Program for people living with dementia. An interdisciplinary team comprising an interaction designer, a software engineer, a music therapist, and a research assistant engaged in co-design meetings. The interdisciplinary and participatory process yielded four ideas and four lines of action, which evolved iteratively as the work meetings progressed. Points raised by the lines of action were addressed, leading to modifications in the Emobook app and adjustments in the intervention program for seamless integration. Collaborative, interdisciplinary efforts are essential in advancing the incorporation of technology into music therapy practice. This study demonstrates the value of a Participatory Design approach in adapting technology for use in Music Therapy.

  Abstract   
 The Nucleo de Dança Redes at the State University of Campinas has been developing multimodal artistic research in mixed reality in an interactive, immersive, dialogical, and in nets. In this article we present some research focus of the group referencing two works “De uma Margem a Outra” and “Jardim das Cartas”. Researchers in the areas of dance, music and audio visual have been raising discussions about an “expanded sound body” that stems from the interaction between movement, sound, music, video and technology in a mixed environment. A body that extends in sound, and an embodied sound in movement in an expanded perspective of the body in “presence” with more complex contours.   
 Another point is in the observation and understanding of the event of multimodal improvisation in a mixed environment as a path and an interactive and connective articulation between the communication agent that participate in the net as an expressive path that is shown in the interactive exploration. Based on interactive practices and on the concept of net, we work methodologically towards a “poetic interaction” in the field of complexity. A fertile ground in which improvisation and composition become coordinated paths for the unfolding of a dance which starts from the connectivity and from the interaction between sound, body movement, image and technology.

 Art as an Expanded Field: The Case of the R/Place Social Experiment  
  Abstract   
 In this paper, we will present the social experiment originating from the website Reddit, r/place, and our findings regarding how this experiment has been analyzed and understood, with three interpretations of our studies that could be associated with r/place. On top of that, we will introduce our art research methodology, “art as an expanded field,” in which r/place will be our subject of analysis, with the concept of artification described by scholar Ellen Dissanayake as our theoretical starting point for such an endeavor. It is not in the interest of this work to thoroughly analyze r/place but to present a paradigm for understanding it and possibly further experiments, as well as present the beginnings of our methodology currently developed.   
 Marcela Jatene Cavalcante Botelho, Hosana Celeste Oliveira   
 Epic’s “Metahuman Creator” is a new type of digital human configurator, based on pre-existing scans of real people where only physically plausible adjustments can be made. As it has a vast range of facial features and skin tones the user can design a variety of digital characters. However, its tools representing trans identities and invisible disabilities have limitations. Here we show the experience of two users, one with a hearing disability and the other undergoing gender-affirming therapy.   
 We found that tools for representing their identity fell short of expressing their inherent human dignity. The foundations of the Metaverse are therefore at risk of replicating inaccessibility and excluding persons with disabilities and gender differences.   
 We anticipate our paper to be the starting point for wider participatory research that involves all user groups in the design of platforms, tools and systems. We foresee the findings of our paper fulfilling the UN Charter on Human rights in the digital space through the shaping of policies and advancing existing standards (ISO).

 Embodied music interaction, is a broad framework that describe the role of our movement and body in listening, playing or more generally experiencing music. Within this framework, the use of interactive technologies enable opportunities for designing a large variety of systems and instruments. In this talk, I will describe approaches, design methodologies, computational models using machine learning we developed over the years to explore different types of movement-based music interaction. Interestingly, this allows us to consider different perspectives in embodied music interaction such as listening / performing, beginner / virtuoso, solo / collective. I will in particular describe issues in learning and appropriating interactive technologies, ranging from artistic creation to health.

 Call for Papers  
 The 18th ACM ASIA Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM ASIACCS 2023) will be held in Melbourne, Australia from July 10th to July 14th, 2023. We solicit paper submissions on all technical   aspects of security and privacy, including “Systemisation of Knowledge” (SoK) papers. However, purely theoretical  (e.g., cryptography-focused, with no security/application connections) submissions are not encouraged. The same goes for submissions focused primarily on blockchains or machine learning  .    
 Submissions will fall into one of three categories, each reviewed using different criteria: (1) novel attacks/flaws/exploits, (2) new constructs, and (3) SoK-s. The number of accepted submissions will be carefully balanced across all three categories.

 Submission Instructions  
 Please read the instructions below before submitting the paper. Please contact the PC chairs at pc-chairs@asiaccs2023.org  for any questions regarding the submissions.  
 SUBMIT YOUR WORK      
  Paper Formatting  
 Technical papers submitted for ASIACCS are to be written in English. Papers must be in PDF format and at most 12 pages double-column including a bibliography with up to 3 additional pages for well-marked appendices. Note that appendices cannot exceed 3 pages even if the main text is less than 12 pages. Authors should prepare the submissions using the latest ACM Sigconf style conference template only (available at here  ). All fonts, images, tables and figures are required to comply with common standards and do not generate problems for reviewers. Titles of SoK papers must begin with “SoK:”. Submissions not meeting the formatting requirements risk rejection without consideration of their merits.  
 Conflicts of Interest  
 Authors when submitting the paper are required to declare the conflict of interest (COI) with the Program Committee members including the chairs. Those who are considered COI include (1) anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author of the paper at the time of submission, (2) anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author at any time in the past, or (3) anyone the author has collaborated or published within the prior two years. PC members, including chairs that have a conflict of interest with a paper, will be entirely excluded from the evaluation of that paper. Failure of declaring COI, or declaring fake COI can lead to the paper being rejected. If a paper is reviewed by a PC member with COI, it will be rejected.  
 Anonymous Submissions  
 ASIACCS is employing a double-blind reviewing process. All submissions should be appropriately anonymized. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should avoid obvious self-references and should appropriately blind them if used. The list of authors cannot be changed (but the order can be) after the acceptance decision is made unless approved by the Program Chairs.  
 Double and Concurrent Submissions  
 Submissions to ASIACCS 2023 must not substantially overlap with papers that are published or simultaneously submitted to other venues with proceedings (including journals or conferences/workshops). Double-submission will result in immediate rejection. Detected violations may be reported to other conference chairs and journal editors.  
 Ethical Considerations  
 The authors should take care of clarifying any potential ethical and legal concerns to their results, highly critical vulnerabilities or exploits, etc. The authors should provide evidence that they have thoroughly considered such issues.The Program Committee reserves the right to reject a submission if insufficient evidence was presented that ethical or relevant legal concerns were appropriately addressed.  
 Early Rejection and Appeals  
 Paper Revision and Re-submission  
 Rejected papers in the 1st round cannot be resubmitted in the 2nd round. A small number of the 1st round submissions may receive a Revise decision, rather than Accept or Reject, and may be revised and resubmitted together with the response to reviewers’ comments into the same HOTCRP submission server .  The revision may include running additional experiments, improving the paper’s presentation, or other such improvements. Papers meeting the expectations will typically be accepted. Additional revisions will be requested only in exceptional circumstances.  
 Camera-Ready and Conference Presentation  
 If a paper is accepted, the author list in submission cannot be changed when preparing the camera-ready version. Authors of accepted papers must also guarantee that their papers will be presented at the conference. At least one author of the paper must be registered at the appropriate full conference rate.
