Registration  
 October 23 - 25, 2023  
 On This Page  
 Early registration is closed, but regular registration is open! Register before October 4th for the ASSETS'23 conference on the CVENT Registration Site  . We can't wait to have you join us at ASSETS‚Äô23!  
 Registration Overview  
 Registrations for conferences can be complicated, reflecting an array of options and time-contingent fee structures. ASSETS is no different. Allow us to help make sense of things. We have:  
 Four registration types: | (1) ACM member, (2) non-member, (3) student ACM member, | and | (4) student non-member. | If you are not yet an ACM member, it often makes financial sense to become one. See | ACM's membership options here | . 
  Three registration deadlines | that affect pricing: | (1) early, (2) regular, (3) late. | Generally it's best to register early to save costs and to help us plan events. 
  Two conference experiences: | (1) the | in-person conference | in New York City or (2) a (very) lighterweight, | asynchronous virtual option | for those that cannot travel due to personal preference or scheduling. See the | Attending Overview page | for details. 
  Below, we expand on each option and provide pricing.  
 In-Person Conference  
 ASSETS'23 is planned primarily as an in-person event with an asynchronous option for individuals to view pre-recorded videos and engage in discussion on Discord. Please see the Attending Overview  page for details.  
 This hybrid model was used at ASSETS‚Äô22 in Athens, Greece  . the in-person conference experience will be similar to previous in-person ASSETS conferences such as ASSETS'18 in Galway, Ireland  or ASSETS'19 in Pittsburgh, PA  .  
 There will be in-person talks, poster and demo sessions 
  Additional details about the virtual portion of the conference will be posted soon. 
  More details will be shared as the day of the conference gets closer. 
 At least one author of accepted technical papers, posters and demonstrations, or other artifact-based tracks is expected to travel to New York City to present their work. If traveling to ASSETS is inaccessible to you or presents an insurmountable COVID health/safety risk for you, please email General Chair  , and we can find ways to accommodate you.  
 Delegate Type | Early Registration (08/25) | Regular Registration (10/04) | Late Registration 
 Virtual Option  
 ASSETS'23 will offer a lightweight virtual option for those authors and attendees that cannot travel to New York due to COVID health or accessibility concerns. More details will be provided soon as the conference day gets closer.  
 Delegate Type | Early Registration (08/25) | Regular Registration (10/04) | Late Registration 
 Virtual Workshops  
 This year, there are four accepted workshops. See listing on the Accepted Workshops page  .  
 You must apply to participate in a workshop. Each workshop is being run independently by the respective co-organizers along with support from the ASSETS'23 Workshop Co-chairs, Julian Brinkley and Earl Huff Jr. If you are accepted into a workshop, you must register for the workshop track. We hope you will also choose to register for the conference but this is not required. Please email workshops-assets23@acm.org  with questions or concerns.

  The 4th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Automation of Software Test (AST 2023)   
 Software pervasiveness in both industry and digital society, as well as the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are continuously leading to emerging needs from both software producers and consumers. Infrastructures, software components, and applications aim to hide their increasing complexity in order to appear more human-centric. However, the potential risk from design errors, poor integrations, and time-consuming engineering phases can result in unreliable solutions that can barely meet their intended objectives. In this context, Software Engineering processes keep demanding for the investigation of novel and further refined approaches to Software Quality Assurance (SQA). Software testing automation is a discipline that has produced noteworthy research in the last decade. The search for solutions to automatically test any concept of software is critical, and it encompasses several areas: from the generation of the test cases, test oracles, test stubs/mocks; through the definition of selection and prioritization criteria; up to the engineering of infrastructures governing the execution of testing sessions locally or remotely in the cloud.  
 Authors of the best papers presented at AST 2023 will be invited to submit an extension of their work for possible inclusion in a special issue in Software Testing, Verification, and Reliability (STVR) journal.

 Keynotes  
 Keynote 1: Lessons from 10 Years of Automated Debugging Research   
 Track  AST 2023 (Keynotes)    
 Abstract  The last decade or so has seen dramatic developments in automated debugging, including fault localisation and automated program repair. This talk will look back at 10 years of my experience from working on automated debugging, starting from evolving Spectrum Based Fault Localisation, culminating to the latest work on failure reproduction using Large Language Models. We will look at how serendipitous encounters led to new ideas, how getting slightly outside your comfort zone can help you, and how best we can collaborate with industry in order to transfer our research.  
  Keynote 2: Automatic for the People   
 Track  AST 2023 (Keynotes)    
 Abstract  Software testing is one of the key activities to achieve software quality in practice. To that end, both researchers and tool builders have made considerable efforts to make software testing more efficient and more effective. We have the tools, but where do we put our money? In other words, what do we know about software engineers or software testers that actually write and execute tests? What stimulates them, what blocks them, and what do they need from tools, documentation, production code, or their team?

  Regular paper submissions  : A regular paper submission should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, discuss prior work and its relationship to the paper, explicitly and precisely state its key contributions, and outline the key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main results. A regular paper submission should not exceed 12 pages including title page and abstract, but excluding references and an optional appendix. Authors should include all necessary details in their submission so that the Program Committee can judge the correctness, importance and originality of their work. Any material (e.g., proofs or experimental results) omitted (from the main part of 12 pages) due to space limitations can be put into the optional appendix, which will be read at the Program Committee‚Äôs discretion. Regular papers will be allotted up to 20 pages in the proceedings.  
  Short paper  submissions  : A short paper submission may present preliminary results or work-in-progress on a specific topic. Authors should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, discuss prior work and its relationship to the paper, explicitly and precisely state the paper‚Äôs key contributions, and outline the key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. A short paper submission should have at least 4 and at most 6 pages. Authors should provide sufficient details in their submission so that the Program Committee can judge the correctness, importance and originality of their work. Short papers will be allotted up to 6 pages in the proceedings.
