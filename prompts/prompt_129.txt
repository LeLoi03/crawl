  Abstract    
 GQL (Graph Query Language) is being developed as a new ISO standard for graph query languages to play the same role for graph databases as SQL plays for relational. In parallel, an extension of SQL for querying property graphs, SQL/PGQ, is added to the SQL standard; it shares the graph pattern matching functionality with GQL. Both standards (not yet published) are hard-to-understand specifications of hundreds of pages. The goal of this paper is to present a digest of the language that is easy for the research community to understand, and thus to initiate research on these future standards for querying graphs. The paper concentrates on pattern matching features shared by GQL and SQL/PGQ, as well as querying facilities of GQL.

  Abstract    
 Subgraph counting is a fundamental problem that spans many areas in computer science: database theory, logic, network science, data mining, and complexity theory. Given a large input graph G and a small pattern graph H, we wish to count the number of occurrences of H in G. In recent times, there has been a resurgence on using an old (maybe overlooked?) technique of orienting the edges of G and H, and then using a combination of brute-force enumeration and indexing. These orientation techniques appear to give the best of both worlds. There is a rigorous theoretical explanation behind these techniques, and they also have excellent empirical behavior (on large real-world graphs). Time and again, graph orientations help solve subgraph counting problems in various computational models, be it sampling, streaming, distributed, etc. In this paper, we give some short vignettes on how the orientation technique solves a variety of algorithmic problems.

  Abstract    
 Assume there is a data stream of elements and a window of size m. Sliding window algorithms compute various statistic functions over the last m elements of the data stream seen so far. The time complexity of a sliding window algorithm is measured as the time required to output an updated statistic function value every time a new element is read. For example, it is well known that computing the sliding window maximum/minimum has time complexity O(1) while computing the sliding window median has time complexity O(log m). In this paper we close the gap between these two cases by (1) presenting an algorithm for computing the sliding window k-th smallest element in O(log k) time and (2) prove that this time complexity is optimal.

  Abstract    
 This paper initializes the study of range subgraph counting and range subgraph listing, both of which are motivated by the significant demands in practice to perform graph analytics on subgraphs pertinent to only selected, as opposed to all, vertices. In the first problem, there is an undirected graph G where each vertex carries a real-valued attribute. Given an interval q and a pattern Q, a query counts the number of occurrences of Q in the subgraph of G induced by the vertices whose attributes fall in q. The second problem has the same setup except that a query needs to enumerate (rather than count) those occurrences with a small delay. In both problems, our goal is to understand the tradeoff between space usage and query cost, or more specifically: (i) given a target on query efficiency, how much pre-computed information about G must we store? (ii) Or conversely, given a budget on space usage, what is the best query time we can hope for? We establish a suite of upper- and lower-bound results on such tradeoffs for various query patterns.

  Abstract    
 Recent work has demonstrated the catastrophic effects of poor cardinality estimates on query processing time. In particular, underestimating query cardinality can result in overly optimistic query plans which take orders of magnitude longer to complete than one generated with the true cardinality. Cardinality bounding avoids this pitfall by computing an upper bound on the query’s output size using statistics about the database such as table sizes and degrees, i.e. value frequencies. In this paper, we extend this line of work by proving a novel bound called the Degree Sequence Bound which takes into account the full degree sequences and the max tuple multiplicity. This work focuses on the important class of Berge-Acyclic queries for which the Degree Sequence Bound is tight. Further, we describe how to practically compute this bound using a functional approximation of the true degree sequences and prove that even this functional form improves upon previous bounds.

  Abstract    
 Enumeration problems aim at outputting, without repetition, the set of solutions to a given problem instance. However, outputting the entire solution set may be prohibitively expensive if it is too big. In this case, outputting a small, sufficiently diverse subset of the solutions would be preferable. This leads to the Diverse-version of the original enumeration problem, where the goal is to achieve a certain level d of diversity by selecting k solutions. In this paper, we look at the Diverse-version of the query answering problem for Conjunctive Queries and extensions thereof. That is, we study the problem if it is possible to achieve a certain level d of diversity by selecting k answers to the given query and, in the positive case, to actually compute such k answers.

  Abstract    
 Estimating quantiles, like the median or percentiles, is a fundamental task in data mining and data science. A (streaming) quantile summary is a data structure that can process a set S of n elements in a streaming fashion and at the end, for any ϕ ∈ (0,1], return a ϕ-quantile of S up to an ε error, i.e., return a ϕ'-quantile with ϕ' = ϕ ± ε. We are particularly interested in comparison-based summaries that only compare elements of the universe under a total ordering and are otherwise completely oblivious of the universe. The best known deterministic quantile summary is the 20-year old Greenwald-Khanna (GK) summary that uses O((1/ε) log{(ε n)}) space [SIGMOD'01]. This bound was recently proved to be optimal for all deterministic comparison-based summaries by Cormode and Vesleý [PODS'20]. In this paper, we study weighted quantiles, a generalization of the quantiles problem, where each element arrives with a positive integer weight which denotes the number of copies of that element being inserted. The only known method of handling weighted inputs via GK summaries is the naive approach of breaking each weighted element into multiple unweighted items, and feeding them one by one to the summary, which results in a prohibitively large update time (proportional to the maximum weight of input elements). We give the first non-trivial extension of GK summaries for weighted inputs and show that it takes O((1/ε) log(εn)) space and O(log(1/ε)+log log(εn)) update time per element to process a stream of length n (under some quite mild assumptions on the range of weights and ε). En route to this, we also simplify the original GK summaries for unweighted quantiles.

  Abstract    
 A probabilistic database with attribute-level uncertainty consists of relations where cells of some attributes may hold probability distributions rather than deterministic content. Such databases arise, implicitly or explicitly, in the context of noisy operations such as missing data imputation, where we automatically fill in missing values, column prediction, where we predict unknown attributes, and database cleaning (and repairing), where we replace the original values due to detected errors or violation of integrity constraints. We study the computational complexity of problems that regard the selection of cell values in the presence of integrity constraints. More precisely, we focus on functional dependencies and study three problems: (1) deciding whether the constraints can be satisfied by any choice of values, (2) finding a most probable such choice, and (3) calculating the probability of satisfying the constraints. The data complexity of these problems is determined by the combination of the set of functional dependencies and the collection of uncertain attributes. We give full classifications into tractable and intractable complexities for several classes of constraints, including a single dependency, matching constraints, and unary functional dependencies.

 Welcome to the website of the 27th International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems (ICECCS 2023)  
 The 27th International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems (ICECCS 2023) is a well-established event that has been held around the world for over 25 years. Over the past years, we have seen a rapidly rising emphasis on the design, implementation and management of complex computer systems which are present in every aspect of human activities, such as manufacturing, communications, defence, transportation, aerospace, hazardous environments, energy, and healthcare. These complex systems are frequently distributed over heterogeneous networks and process a large amount of data. Complexity arises from many factors, including the dynamic environment and the scenarios these systems operate in, demanding and sometimes conflicting requirements in functionality, efficiency, scalability, security, dependability and adaptability, as well as the wide range of development methodologies, programming languages and implementation details. Performance, real-time behaviour, fault tolerance, security, adaptability, development time and cost, and long life concerns are some of the key issues arising in the development of such systems.  
 The goal of this conference is to bring together industrial, academic, and government experts from a variety of application domains and software disciplines, to discuss how the disciplines' problems and solution techniques interact within the whole system. Researchers, practitioners, tool developers and users, and technology transfer experts are all welcome. The scope of the conference includes long-term research issues, near-term requirements and challenges, established complex systems, emerging promising tools, and retrospective and prospective reflections of research and development into complex systems.

 Aims  
 IFIP TC14 aims to encourage research, development and sharing of innovative ideas, models and practices, on computer applications in entertainment.  
 Chairs: Helmut Hlavacs, Univ. of Vienna, AUSTRIA and Angelo Di Iorio, Univ. of Bologna, Italy  
 Full papers are the main media for presenting high impact, mature research with original new results. Submissions should describe novel unpublished work addressing one or more of the research topics listed. All technical papers will be published in the official Springer LNCS proceedings. Papers must be submitted using the Springer LNCS format.  
 Paper length should reflect the contribution and maturity of the submission and reviewers from the program committee will be instructed to judge the contribution of a paper relative to its length. For example, typical contributions presenting significant research advances/results should not exceed 12 pages in length excluding references (Full Technical Papers). In addition, videos are encouraged and can be included in the paper or as Electronic Supplementary Material.  
  See the Springer LNCS guidelines on how to include these. The committee may accept submissions conditionally or route them for a different category, when appropriate, and consult with authors to adjust their paper according to the review needs. Accepted papers will be scheduled for long presentations and discussion at the conference.  
 Works in Progress  
 Chairs: Erik van der Spek Eindhoven, University of Technology and Andrea Nuzzolese, National Research Council of Italy  
 Work in Progress (WiP) contributions provide an opportunity to present late-breaking work, new experimental projects, research in early phases or with more limited scope than typical full papers. A WiP submission is a shorter submission describing the research problem, contribution, and value to the community, submitted as a PDF file. Accepted papers will be included into the official Springer LNCS proceedings and will be scheduled for presentation and discussion at the conference.  
 WiP submissions should not exceed 8 pages in length, excl. references, in Springer LNCS format. Submissions with exceeding length relative to their contribution can be rejected. The committee may accept submissions conditionally or route them for a different category, when appropriate, and consult with authors to adjust their paper according to the review needs.  
 Workshops and Tutorials  
 We invite proposals for workshops and tutorials that will be held at IFIP-ICEC 2023.  
 Workshops  
 Chairs: Jannicke Baalsrud Hauge KTH Royal Institute of Technology Sweden and Barbara Goebl University of Wien Austria  
 We invite proposals in all areas of entertainment computing and serious games research (see conference topics listed above) and particularly welcome proposals  
  that will focus on and promote discussion on new and emerging trends in these areas. Workshop proposals must include the following information:  
  – Short but relevant bio information of the organizers;  
  – Expected workshop outcomes (proceedings, special issue of journals, project proposals, etc.);  
  – Proposed workshop due dates (take into consideration conference schedules); workshops can be scheduled for either half a day (4h) or a full day (8h).  
  – Workshops are open to all IFIP-ICEC attendees at no additional cost, even if not submitting contributions.  
 Submissions need to adhere to the stated workshop proposal deadline. Additionally, to be considered for inclusion in the conference proceedings, authors of workshop proposals may also submit a 6 page (maximum, excl. references) paper in the Springer LNCS format, observing the deadline for full paper submission. Regular workshop proposals will not be included in the proceedings.  
 Tutorials  
 Chairs: Allegra De Filippo  
 We invite proposals for tutorials that will be held in conjunction with ICEC 2023. We invite proposals in all areas of entertainment computing (see conference topics listed above) and particularly welcome proposals that will focus on and promote discussion on new and emerging trends. Tutorial proposals should be two pages in length and must include the following information:  
 – Contact information (name, affiliation, address, phone number and email) of the tutorial organizer(s);  
  – Relevant CV information of the tutorial leader(s);  
  – Brief summary of the content.  
 To be considered for inclusion in the conference proceedings, authors of tutorial proposals may also submit a 6 page (maximum) paper in the Springer LNCS  
  format, observing the deadline for full paper submission. Regular tutorial proposals will not be included in the proceedings.  
 Interactive Entertainment / Experiential Works  
 Chairs: Jerome Dupire CNAM Paris and Andrea Poltronieri Univ of Bologna  
 Interactive demonstrations, installations and games show early implementations of novel, interesting, and important entertainment computing concepts, systems, installations or games, or can serve to showcase results not previously described in the research literature.  
 Both research and industry is encouraged to send in and showcase demonstrators of novel approaches to entertainment. We particularly encourage demonstrations with which attendees can interact and play.  
 Demonstration, installation, or a game submission is a shorter submission describing a novel approach to entertainment computing concepts. The submissions will be peer-reviewed and should be composed of a document with 4-5 pages using Springer LNCS format, and structured as follows: (1) up to four pages for an extended abstract and (2) a final page that contains the link to an online video, a list of technical requirements (including electrical and connectivity needs), and physical space requirements (including display and footprint needs). Successful submissions will be included in the conference proceedings.  
 The extended abstract should be written according to the underlying structure of the structured abstract and must be clear, straightforward, and easy to understand. The extended abstract must contain the following sections: abstract and keywords, introduction, methodology, findings, conclusion, and references.  
 Sections can be named differently, and subsections can be included. Supporting figures, tables and images of the results may be included in the extended abstract.  
 Student Game and Interactive Entertainment Competition  
 Chairs: Erik van der Spek and Mara Dionisio  
 Next to the Interactive Entertainment expo, IFIP-ICEC 2023 also organizes a competition for student games and interactive entertainment. All students up to and including PhD candidate level are eligible to send in their game or interactive entertainment installation, as long as the demonstrator is fully experiential, and the demonstrator is part of a research endeavor. This could be a platform to perform research with, a research through design contribution, or a design exemplar of something that advances the state of the art, but the paper detailing the game or interactive entertainment installation should make clear what the development of it may add to our knowledge of games and entertainment. For PhD candidates, this could be a good venue to have the artifact contribution of your game peer reviewed and published in official proceedings.  
 Submissions to the game and interactive entertainment competition should be done in a 4-6 page extended abstract in Springer LNCS format, that among others clearly describes the research goal, a description of the experience of the demonstrator with pictures, and how the demonstrator advances the state of the art.  
 At least one of the student authors on the paper needs to register and be physically present at the conference to showcase the game or installation in order to have a chance at winning the competition. A jury of experts is formed at the conference to select the winner, and the winner will be announced at the end of the conference.  
 There are two submission moments for the student competition. In order to be eligible for the proceedings, you have to submit your paper by the early submission deadline. If you want to participate in the competition without a conference proceedings paper, there is also a late submission deadline.  
 Doctoral Consortium  
 Chair: Esteban Clua  
 The Doctoral Consortium provides an opportunity for doctoral students to explore and develop their research interests in an interdisciplinary workshop, under the guidance of a panel of distinguished researchers in entertainment computing and/or serious games. We invite students who feel they would benefit from this kind of feedback on their dissertation work to apply for this unique opportunity to share their work with students in a similar situation as well as senior researchers in the field. The strongest candidates will be those who have a clear idea and an area, and have made some progress, but who are not so far along that they can no longer make changes. Also, as well as stating how you will gain from acceptance, both you and your advisor should be clear on what you can contribute to the Doctoral Consortium.  
 The Consortium will provide a supportive setting for feedback on students’ current research and guidance on future research directions. It will also offer each student comments and fresh perspectives on their work from researchers and students outside their own institution and promote the development of a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative research.
