 Today we are building an exciting future in which autonomous vehicles navigate complex environments, smart cities help solve public problems and achieve a higher quality of life, and service robots support social care workers or perform tasks that are too dangerous for humans. However, these software-intensive systems must continuously preserve and optimize their operation in the presence of uncertain changes in their operating environment, resource variability, evolving user needs, attacks and faults. In addition, the complexity of these systems demands them to adapt and manage themselves autonomously.  
 SEAMS is a CORE-A ranked conference that applies software engineering methods, techniques, processes, and tools to support the construction of safe, performant, and cost-effective self-adaptive and autonomous systems that provide self-* properties like self-configuration, self-healing, self-optimization, and self-protection. The objective of SEAMS is to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to investigate, discuss, examine, and advance the fundamental principles, state of the art, and the solutions addressing critical challenges of engineering self-adaptive and self-managing systems.  
 For more information, please visit the research track  and the artifact track  sites.  
 NEW:   SEAMS 2023 will use two submission rounds for the Research Track, with firm deadlines in October 2022  and February 2023  , and with the possibility of submitting a revised version from the first round to the second as detailed below.

  Abstract    
 We consider a variant of treewidth that we call clique-partitioned treewidth in which each bag is partitioned into cliques. This is motivated by the recent development of FPT-algorithms based on similar parameters for various problems. With this paper, we take a first step towards computing clique-partitioned tree decompositions. Our focus lies on the subproblem of computing clique partitions, i.e., for each bag of a given tree decomposition, we compute an optimal partition of the induced subgraph into cliques. The goal here is to minimize the product of the clique sizes (plus 1). We show that this problem is NP-hard. We also describe four heuristic approaches as well as an exact branch-and-bound algorithm. Our evaluation shows that the branch-and-bound solver is sufficiently efficient to serve as a good baseline. Moreover, our heuristics yield solutions close to the optimum. As a bonus, our algorithms allow us to compute first upper bounds for the clique-partitioned treewidth of real-world networks. A comparison to traditional treewidth indicates that clique-partitioned treewidth is a promising parameter for graphs with high clustering.

  Abstract    
 Given a string X of length n on alphabet σ, the FM-index data structure allows counting all occurrences of a pattern P of length m in O(m) time via an algorithm called backward search. An important difficulty when searching with an FM-index is to support queries on L, the Burrows-Wheeler transform of X, while L is in compressed form. This problem has been the subject of intense research for 25 years now. Run-length encoding of L is an effective way to reduce index size, in particular when the data being indexed is highly-repetitive, which is the case in many types of modern data, including those arising from versioned document collections and in pangenomics. This paper takes a back-to-basics look at supporting backward search in FM-indexes, exploring and engineering two simple designs. The first divides the BWT string into blocks containing b symbols each and then run-length compresses each block separately, possibly introducing new runs (compared to applying run-length encoding once, to the whole string). Each block stores counts of each symbol that occurs before the block. This method supports the operation rank_c(L, i) (i.e., count the number of times c occurs in the prefix L[1..i]) by first determining the block i/b in which i falls and scanning the block to the appropriate position counting occurrences of c along the way. This partial answer to rank_c(L, i) is then added to the stored count of c symbols before the block to determine the final answer. Our second design has a similar structure, but instead divides the run-length-encoded version of L into blocks containing an equal number of runs. The trick then is to determine the block in which a query falls, which is achieved via a predecessor query over the block starting positions. We show via extensive experiments on a wide range of repetitive text collections that these FM-indexes are not only easy to implement, but also fast and space efficient in practice.

  Abstract    
 We provide and study several algorithms for sorting an array of n comparable distinct elements subject to probabilistic comparison errors. In this model, the comparison of two elements returns the wrong answer according to a fixed probability, p_e < 1/2, and otherwise returns the correct answer. The dislocation of an element is the distance between its position in a given (current or output) array and its position in a sorted array. There are various algorithms that can be utilized for sorting or near-sorting elements subject to probabilistic comparison errors, but these algorithms are not data oblivious because they all make heavy use of noisy binary searching. In this paper, we provide new methods for sorting with comparison errors that are data oblivious while avoiding the use of noisy binary search methods. In addition, we experimentally compare our algorithms and other sorting algorithms.

  Abstract    
 Optimizing over the efficient set of a discrete multi-objective problem is a challenging issue. The main reason is that, unlike when optimizing over the feasible set, the efficient set is implicitly characterized. Therefore, methods designed for this purpose iteratively generate efficient solutions by solving appropriate single-objective problems. However, the number of efficient solutions can be quite large and the problems to be solved can be difficult practically. Thus, the challenge is both to minimize the number of iterations and to reduce the difficulty of the problems to be solved at each iteration. In this paper, a new enumeration scheme is proposed. By introducing some constraints and optimizing over projections of the search region, potentially large parts of the search space can be discarded, drastically reducing the number of iterations. Moreover, the single-objective programs to be solved can be guaranteed to be feasible, and a starting solution can be provided allowing warm start resolutions. This results in a fast algorithm that is simple to implement. Experimental computations on two standard multi-objective instance families show that our approach seems to perform significantly faster than the state of the art algorithm.

  Abstract    
 The subgraph counting problem computes the number of subgraphs of a given graph that satisfy some constraints. Among various constraints imposed on a graph, those regarding the connectivity of vertices, such as "these two vertices must be connected," have great importance since they are indispensable for determining various graph substructures, e.g., paths, Steiner trees, and rooted spanning forests. In this view, the subgraph counting problem under connectivity constraints is also important because counting such substructures often corresponds to measuring the importance of a vertex in network infrastructures. However, we must solve the subgraph counting problems multiple times to compute such an importance measure for every vertex. Conventionally, they are solved separately by constructing decision diagrams such as BDD and ZDD for each problem. However, even solving a single subgraph counting is a computationally hard task, preventing us from solving it multiple times in a reasonable time. In this paper, we propose a dynamic programming framework that simultaneously counts subgraphs for every vertex by focusing on similar connectivity constraints. Experimental results show that the proposed method solved multiple subgraph counting problems about 10-20 times faster than the existing approach for many problem settings.

  Abstract    
 We present Arc-Flag TB, a journey planning algorithm for public transit networks which combines Trip-Based Public Transit Routing (TB) with the Arc-Flags speedup technique. Compared to previous attempts to apply Arc-Flags to public transit networks, which saw limited success, our approach uses stronger pruning rules to reduce the search space. Our experiments show that Arc-Flag TB achieves a speedup of up to two orders of magnitude over TB, offering query times of less than a millisecond even on large countrywide networks. Compared to the state-of-the-art speedup technique Trip-Based Public Transit Routing Using Condensed Search Trees (TB-CST), our algorithm achieves similar query times but requires significantly less additional memory. Other state-of-the-art algorithms which achieve even faster query times, e.g., Public Transit Labeling, require enormous memory usage. In contrast, Arc-Flag TB offers a tradeoff between query performance and memory usage due to the fact that the number of regions in the network partition required by our algorithm is a configurable parameter. We also identify a previously undiscovered issue in the transfer precomputation of TB, which causes both TB-CST and Arc-Flag TB to answer some queries incorrectly. We provide discussion on how to resolve this issue in the future. Currently, Arc-Flag TB answers 1-6% of queries incorrectly, compared to over 20% for TB-CST on some networks.

  Abstract    
 Relative Lempel-Ziv (RLZ) parsing is a dictionary compression method in which a string S is compressed relative to a second string R (called the reference) by parsing S into a sequence of substrings that occur in R. RLZ is particularly effective at compressing sets of strings that have a high degree of similarity to the reference string, such as a set of genomes of individuals from the same species. With the now cheap cost of DNA sequencing, such datasets have become extremely abundant and are rapidly growing. In this paper, instead of using a single reference string for the entire collection, we investigate the use of different reference strings for subsets of the collection, with the aim of improving compression. In particular, we propose a new compression scheme hierarchical relative Lempel-Ziv (HRLZ) which form a rooted tree (or hierarchy) on the strings and then compress each string using RLZ with parent as reference, storing only the root of the tree in plain text. To decompress, we traverse the tree in BFS order starting at the root, decompressing children with respect to their parent. We show that this approach leads to a twofold improvement in compression on bacterial genome datasets, with negligible effect on decompression time compared to the standard single reference approach. We show that an effective hierarchy for a given set of strings can be constructed by computing the optimal arborescence of a completed weighted digraph of the strings, with weights as the number of phrases in the RLZ parsing of the source and destination vertices. We further show that instead of computing the complete graph, a sparse graph derived using locality-sensitive hashing can significantly reduce the cost of computing a good hierarchy, without adversely effecting compression performance.

  Abstract    
 Yao graphs are geometric spanners that connect each point of a given point set to its nearest neighbor in each of k cones drawn around it. Yao graphs were introduced to construct minimum spanning trees in d dimensional spaces. Moreover, they are used for instance in topology control in wireless networks. An optimal 𝒪(n log n)-time algorithm to construct Yao graphs for a given point set has been proposed in the literature but - to the best of our knowledge - never been implemented. Instead, algorithms with a quadratic complexity are used in popular packages to construct these graphs. In this paper we present the first implementation of the optimal Yao graph algorithm. We engineer the data structures required to achieve the 𝒪(n log n) time bound and detail algorithmic adaptations necessary to take the original algorithm from theory to practice. We propose a priority queue data structure that separates static and dynamic events and might be of independent interest for other sweepline algorithms. Additionally, we propose a new Yao graph algorithm based on a uniform grid data structure that performs well for medium-sized inputs. We evaluate our implementations on a wide variety of synthetic and real-world datasets and show that our implementation outperforms current publicly available implementations by at least an order of magnitude.

  Call for Papers  
 The 20th annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication and Networking (SECON) will provide a unique forum to exchange innovative research ideas, recent results, and share experiences among researchers and practitioners in wireless and mobile communication networks. The conference aims to serve as the reference exhibit for state-of-the-art research supported by implementation and insights gained on all scales of experimental systems, network architectures, components, and protocols.  
 Looking beyond current sensing, communication, and networking paradigms, IEEE SECON continues to emphasize pioneering cross-disciplinary work as its signature footprint in the contemporary research landscape. Towards that end, SECON encourages work that falls at the intersection of traditional sensing/networking and new disciplinary areas including (but not limited to) machine intelligence, data analytics, edge computing, social networks, rural connectivity, electromagnetic fields, to name a few, encompassing topics ranging from biological communication and computing networks to uncharted wireless bands, edge intelligence, social media data exploitation, mobile data analysis and beyond 5G/6G networking/communications aspects. Papers describing original, previously unpublished research, experimental efforts, practical experiences, as well as visionary roadmaps, in all aspects of sensor networks, Internet of Things, mobile devices, and wireless communication are solicited. Particular topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 New communication paradigms, such as Terahertz communications, optical Wireless communications, visible light communication, acoustic communication, and uncharted wireless bands, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces 
  Cellular communications and data networks, including 5G, 6G and beyond 
  Resilience, dependability and sustainability of sensing systems (e.g. agriculture, industry, energy, transportation, water, and other smart infrastructural systems, autonomous driving, industrial internet, and smart cities) 
  Novel applications such as wearable computing, virtual/augmented reality, smart and connected communities, sensing and networking of social systems 
  PAPER SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION   
 Papers should neither have been published elsewhere nor be currently under review at another venue. All papers for IEEE SECON 2023 must be submitted via the conference submission system. Each submission must be no longer than 9 pages  (including all the figures, references, and appendices) and in font size of 10 points. Submissions that violate the formatting guidelines will be rejected without review.  
 All submitted papers will be judged based on their quality and relevance through double-blind reviewing, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers. As an author, you are required to preserve the anonymity of your submission, while at the same time allowing the reader to fully grasp the context of related past work, including your own. Common sense and careful writing will go a long way towards preserving anonymity. Papers that do not conform to our double-blind submission policies will be rejected without review.  
 \documentclass[10pt, conference, letterpaper]{IEEEtran}  
 Do not use additional LaTeX commands or packages to override and change the default typesetting choices in the template, including line spacing, font sizes, margins, space between the columns, and font types. This implies that the manuscript must use 10-point Times font, two-column formatting, as well as all default margins and line spacing requirements as dictated by the original version of IEEEtran.cls version 1.8. A smaller font size, up to 8pt, is allowed for reference pages. You can ignore any warning of the submission system for the reference pages.  
 If you are using Microsoft Word to format your paper, you should use an unmodified version of the Microsoft Word IEEE Transactions template (US letter size). Regardless of the source of your paper formatting, you must submit your paper in the Adobe PDF format.  
 The paper must print clearly and legibly, including all the figures, on standard black-and-white printers. Reviewers are not required to read your paper in color.  
 The organizers of IEEE SECON 2023 as well as our attendees expect accepted papers to be presented at the conference. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from IEEE Xplore) if the paper is not presented at the conference.  
 Submit your papers via EDAS at:
