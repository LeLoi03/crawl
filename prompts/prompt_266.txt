  Venue: Hitotsubashi Hall, Tokyo, Japan  
 The Systems and Software Product Line Conference (SPLC)  is a premier forum where researchers, practitioners, and educators can present and discuss the most recent ideas, trends, experiences, and challenges in the area of software and system product lines engineering. Conference events include opportunities to hear industry leaders’ real-world experiences and researchers’ latest ideas and to learn from both.  
 The 27th ACM International Systems and Software Product Line Conference (SPLC 2023) will be held from August 28th to September 1st at Hitotsubashi Hall  in Tokyo, Japan.  
 The conference will include a highly selective program of research papers and industry papers, accompanied by keynote speeches, workshops, demonstrations, tutorials, panels, and doctoral symposium. Besides, SPLC 2023 advocates the discussion of challenges in the area of software and system product line engineering by adding a challenge track and encourage research discussion by a journal first track. We warmly welcome high quality papers, which describe original and unpublished research advancing the state of the art in software and system product line. We hope that SPLC 2023 can successfully bring an opportunity to hear and learn from both leaders’ real-world experiences and researchers’ latest ideas.

 The Symposium on Solid and Physical Modeling (SPM) is an international conference series organised annually with the support of the Solid Modeling Association (SMA). This conference is in-cooperation with the ACM Siggraph and the Eurographics Association. SPM'22 will be held as an online event on June 27-29, 2022. The conference aims at all aspects of geometric and physical modeling, and their application in design, analysis and manufacturing, as well as in biomedical, geophysical, digital entertainment, and other areas. The conference serves also as a ceremony for awarding the 2022 Pierre Bézier Prize for contributions to solid, shape, and physical modeling.
