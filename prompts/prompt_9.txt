 ADCOM 2023: Adaptive, Generative and Bio-inspired AI in Computing and Communication   
 The Advanced Computing and Communications Society  (ACCS) in association with the Digital University Kerala  announces the 28th annual International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications  (ADCOM 2023) at Maker Village, Kochi during 8th – 10th December 2023.  
 ADCOM, the flagship Systems Conference of the ACCS, is a major annual international meeting that draws leading scientists and researchers in computational and communications engineering from across industry and academia. ADCOM highlights the growing importance of Large-Scale Systems Engineering and provides the platform to share, discuss and witness leading edge research and trends.  
 ADCOM 2023 explores the current state-of-art AI covering a broad spectrum of adaptive, generative and bio-inspired algorithms and/or hardware useful in computing and communications. Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can create new content, such as text, images, or other media, from scratch. Generative AI models are trained on large datasets of existing content, and then use this data to learn the patterns and rules that govern how that content is created. Generative AI has a wide range of potential applications in Content creation, Data augmentation, Artificial intelligence assistant, Entertainment, Product design etc.  
 ADCOM 2023 calls for original, high impact research papers and case studies on many aspects of Embedded AI systems and related technologies while seeking novel contributions that help identify challenges in the widespread deployment of such systems. Researchers and practitioners are encouraged to submit original research contributions in all major areas, which include, but not limited to:  
 Bringing AI, machine learning – deep learning, reinforcement learning etc. – to embedded devices and the network edge 
  Defining edge requirements: intelligence, computing performance, connectivity
