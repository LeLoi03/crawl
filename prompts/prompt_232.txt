  Program Committee announced. 
  Overview of PPDP 2023  
  PPDP aims to provide a forum that brings together researchers from the declarative programming communities, including those working in the logic, constraint and functional programming paradigms, but also embracing a variety of other paradigms such as visual programming, executable specification languages, database languages, AI languages and knowledge representation languages used, for example, in the semantic web.  
 The goal is to stimulate research in the use of logical formalisms and methods for specifying, performing, and analysing computations, including mechanisms for mobility, modularity, concurrency, object-orientation, security, and static analysis. Papers related to the use of declarative paradigms and tools in industry and education are especially solicited.  
 Scope  
  Tools and Applications: programming and proof environments; verification tools; case studies in proof assistants or interactive theorem provers; certification; novel applications of declarative programming inside and outside of CS; declarative programming pearls; practical experience reports and industrial application; education. 
  The PC chair will be happy to advise on the appropriateness of a topic.  
 PPDP 2023 will be held in Cascais, Lisbon, Portugal. Previous symposia were held at Tbilisi (Georgia)  , Tallinn (Estonia)  , Bologna (Italy)  , Porto (Portugal)  , Frankfurt am Main (Germany)  , Namur (Belgium)  , Edinburgh (UK)  , Siena (Italy)  , Canterbury (UK)  , Madrid (Spain)  , Leuven (Belgium)  , Odense (Denmark)  , Hagenberg (Austria)  , Coimbra (Portugal)  , Valencia (Spain)  , Wroclaw (Poland)  , Venice (Italy)  , Lisboa (Portugal)  , Verona (Italy)  , Uppsala (Sweden)  , Pittsburgh (USA)  , Florence (Italy)  , Montréal (Canada)  , and Paris (France)  .

  Submission Categories & Guidelines  
  Submission page is available via EasyChair  .  
  Selected papers will be invited to the Journal of Functional Programming (JFP) or the Journal of Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).  
  Submission Categories  
 Submissions can be made in three categories: regular Research Papers  , System Descriptions  , and Experience Reports  .  
 Submissions of Research Papers  must present original research which is unpublished and not submitted elsewhere. They must not exceed 12 pages ACM style 2-column (including figures, but excluding bibliography). Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally published workshop proceedings may be submitted (please contact the PC chair in case of questions). Research papers will be judged on originality, significance, correctness, clarity, and readability.  
 Submission of System Descriptions  must describe a working system whose description has not been published or submitted elsewhere. They must not exceed 10 pages and should contain a link to a working system. System Descriptions must be marked as such at the time of submission and will be judged on originality, significance usefulness, clarity, and readability.  
 Submissions of Experience Reports  are meant to help create a body of published, refereed, citable evidence where declarative programming such as functional, logic, answer-set, constraint programming, etc., is used in practice. They must not exceed 5 pages including references  . Experience Reports must be marked as such at the time of submission and need not report original research results. They will be judged on significance usefulness, clarity, and readability.  
 Possible topics for an Experience Report include, but are not limited to:  
 insights gained from real-world projects using declarative programming 
  novel use of declarative programming in the classroom 
  programming pearl that illustrates a nifty new data structure or programming technique. 
  Supplementary material may be provided via a link to an extended version of the submission (recommended), or in a clearly marked appendix beyond the above-mentioned page limits. Reviewers are not required to study extended versions or any material beyond the respective page limit. Material beyond the page limit will not be included in the final published version.  
 Format of a submission  
 Requirements for publication  
 At least one author of each accepted submission will be expected to attend and present the work at the conference. The pc chair may retract a paper that is not presented. The pc chair may also retract a paper if complaints about the paper's correctness are raised which cannot be resolved by the final paper deadline.

 Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming 2023  
 PPoPP is the premier forum for leading work on all aspects of parallel programming, including theoretical foundations, techniques, languages, compilers, runtime systems, tools, and practical experience. In the context of the symposium, “parallel programming” encompasses work on concurrent and parallel systems (multicore, multi-threaded, heterogeneous, clustered, and distributed systems; grids; datacenters; clouds; and large scale machines). Given the rise of parallel architectures in the consumer market (desktops, laptops, and mobile devices) and data centers, PPoPP is particularly interested in work that addresses new parallel workloads and issues that arise out of extreme-scale applications or cloud platforms, as well as techniques and tools that improve the productivity of parallel programming or work towards improved synergy with such emerging architectures.  
 View the track page for all the details of the main conference.  
 Proceedings will be available in the ACM Digital Library.

  All deadlines are at midnight anywhere on earth (AoE), and are firm.  
 Scope:   
 PPoPP is the premier forum for leading work on all aspects of parallel programming, including theoretical foundations, techniques, languages, compilers, runtime systems, tools, and practical experience. In the context of the symposium, “parallel programming” encompasses work on concurrent and parallel systems (multicore, multi-threaded, heterogeneous, clustered, and distributed systems; grids; data centers; clouds; and large scale machines). Given the rise of parallel architectures in the consumer market (desktops, laptops, and mobile devices) and data centers, PPoPP is particularly interested in work that addresses new parallel workloads and issues that arise out of extreme-scale applications or cloud platforms, as well as techniques and tools that improve the productivity of parallel programming or work towards improved synergy with such emerging architectures.  
 Specific topics of interest include (but are not limited to):  
 Compilers and runtime systems for parallel and heterogeneous systems 
  Software productivity for parallel programming 
  Synchronization and concurrency control 
  Papers should report on original research relevant to parallel programming and should contain enough background materials to make them accessible to the entire parallel programming research community. Papers describing experience should indicate how they illustrate general principles or lead to new insights; papers about parallel programming foundations should indicate how they relate to practice. PPoPP submissions will be evaluated based on their technical merit and accessibility. Submissions should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, compare to the existing body of work on the topic, and explicitly and precisely state the paper’s key contributions and results towards addressing the problem. Submissions should strive to be accessible both to a broad audience and to experts in the area.  
 Paper Submission:   
 All papers must be prepared in ACM Conference Format using the 2-column  acmart  format: use the SIGPLAN proceedings template acmart-sigplanproc-template.tex  for Latex,and interim-layout.docx  for Word. You may also want to consult the official ACM information on the Master Article Template  and related tools. Important note: The Word template (interim-layout.docx) on the ACM website uses 9pt font; you need to increase it to 10pt.  
 Papers should contain a maximum of 10 pages of text (in a typeface no smaller than 10 point) or figures, NOT INCLUDING references. There is no page limit for references and they must include the name of all authors (not {et al.}). Appendices are not allowed, but the authors may submit supplementary material, such as proofs or source code; all supplementary material must be in PDF or ZIP format. Looking at supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers.  
 PPoPP 2023 will employ a double-blind reviewing process. To facilitate this process, submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. They should also ensure that any references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important background references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas. Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chairs by email.  
 Submissions should be in PDF and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper. Papers may be resubmitted to the submission site multiple times up until the deadline, but the last version submitted before the deadline will be the version reviewed. Papers that exceed the length requirement, that deviate from the expected format, or that are submitted late will be rejected.  
 All submissions that are not accepted for regular presentations will be automatically considered for posters. Two-page summaries of accepted posters will be included in the conference proceedings.  
 To allow reproducibility, we encourage authors of accepted papers to submit their papers for Artifact Evaluation (AE). The AE process begins after the acceptance notification, and is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Artifact evaluation is voluntary and will not affect paper acceptance, but will be taken into consideration when selecting papers for awards. Papers that go through the AE process successfully will receive one or several of the ACM reproducibility badges, printed on the papers themselves. More information will be posted on the AE website.  
 Deadlines expire at midnight anywhere on earth.  
 Publication Date:   
 The titles of all accepted papers are typically announced shortly after the author notification date (late November 2022). Note, however, that this is not the official publication date. The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. ACM will make the proceedings available via the Digital Library for one month, up to 2 weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 ACM Publications Policies:   
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.
