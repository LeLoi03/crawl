  Coral Bay, Pafos, Cyprus   
    June 19-21, 2023   
 DCOSS-IoT has always been technically co-sponsored by IEEE Computer Society and IEEE Technical Committee on Parallel Processing (TCPP).   
  The 19 th  Annual International Conference on Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things (DCOSS-IoT 2023) will take place in Cyprus, at the Coral Bay near the city of Pafos.  
 The conference intended since its creation to cover several aspects of distributed computing in smartsystems such as high level abstractions and models, systematic design methodologies, signal and information processing, algorithms, analysis and applications. Starting from the 2023 event, DCOSS is broadening its scope beyond sensor networks to smart systems in general as well as the Internet of Things (IoT). The updated name is “Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things” (DCOSS-IoT).

 Metadata Innovation: Enabling Knowledge in a Data-Intensive World

 Conference Portal Login    
 DCMI 2023, the twenty-first International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata Applications, will embrace the whole spectrum of innovation in metadata design, implementation, and best practices, with a special focus on challenges and opportunities in a data-intensive world.  
 Today's data-driven, data-dependent, and data-intensive environment requires metadata that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR), which is the underpinning of data and knowledge ecosystems.  
 Metadata has never been more crucial than today. Trending fields related to digital transformation such as connected data catalogs, collaboration and remote work, artificial intelligence and machine learning, digital history and ethics, and open science depend on high-quality metadata.  
 The parallel growth of data and metadata challenges the metadata community to rethink its research and practices in order to stay ahead of emerging trends.  
 DCMI 2023 is a venue for discussing "innovative practice" - new solutions to practical problems. It draws participants from universities, research institutions, and LAMs (libraries, archives, museums), as well as corporations, non-profit organizations, and government agencies.

 New! Dependable computer systems in medicine and health care  
 In the eighteenth edition of DepCoS-RELCOMEX, we are expanding the conference scope towards the application of computer techniques and technologies in medicine and health care. Below, we have listed examples of research areas that, in our opinion, are important from the point of view of medicine and at the same time closely related to the subject of the conference.    
 Imaging techniques and analysis of medical images
