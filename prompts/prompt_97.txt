1. FlAIRS_1 conference:
FLAIRS-23  
  The 23rd International FLAIRS  Conference   
 Daytona Beach, Florida, USA   
 Schedule updated with final program.   
 Call for Papers   
 General Conference   
 Submission of papers for presentation at the conference is now invited. Topics of interest are in all areas of artificial intelligence, including:  
 Foundations  Knowledge representation 
 Special Tracks   
 A number of special tracks that focus on particular topics within AI are held in parallel with the general conference. These provide researchers in specific areas the opportunity to meet and present their work, and offer a forum for interaction among the broader community of artificial intelligence researchers. Authors are requested to consider submitting their paper directly to a special track if one exists that closely matches the topic of their paper. A list of all special tracks is provided in the “Special Tracks” section of the conference site. For additional details on a particular special track, authors should contact the track chair(s) directly.  
 Special tracks are typically proposed and selected by late summer as part of a Call for Special Tracks. If you are interested in proposing a special track, please check the “Special Tracks” section of the conference site for details on the Call for Special Tracks.  
 Submission Instructions   
 Submitted papers must be original, and not submitted concurrently to a journal or another conference. Double-blind reviewing will be provided, so submitted papers must use fake author names and affiliations. Full papers may be up to 6 pages, and poster papers up to 2 pages. Papers must be in AAAI format and must use the latest AAAI Press Word template or LaTeX macro package  .  
 Papers must be submitted in PDF format via the EasyChair conference management site for FLAIRS-23  . (N.B. Do not use a fake name for your EasyChair login -- your EasyChair account information is hidden from reviewers.) The proceedings of FLAIRS will be published by the AAAI. Authors of accepted papers will be required to sign a form transferring copyright of their contribution to AAAI. An author of each accepted paper is required to register, attend, and present the paper at FLAIRS.  
 Dates   
 Call for Special Tracks (CLOSED)   
 Special tracks, held in parallel with the general conference, are an integral part of the conference. They provide researchers in focused areas the opportunity to meet and present their work, and offer a forum for interaction among the broader community of artificial intelligence researchers. Their papers are required to meet the same standards and are published in the conference proceedings.  
 Topics of interest are in all areas related to artificial intelligence. For example, last year's special tracks included: AI Education; AI Planning and Scheduling; Applied Natural Language Processing; Case-Based Reasoning; Data Mining; Design, Evaluation, and Refinement of Intelligent Systems (DERIS); Games and Entertainment; Intelligent Tutoring Systems; Semantics, Ontologies, and Computational Linguistics; and Uncertain Reasoning.  
 We encourage proposals for topics that have run previously. Even special tracks that have run for a number of years may need or benefit from new leadership support and perspective, so please do not hesitate to indicate interest in an area, or to contact the Special Tracks Coordinator if you have questions about proposing on a particular topic. We are also particularly interested in fresh tracks in areas such as Machine Learning or AI in English as a Second Language, but all proposals for tracks are very much encouraged.  
 Submission of proposals for special tracks is now invited. Proposals must be submitted via the EasyChair conference management site for FLAIRS-23  . Special track chairs may submit to their own tracks. Those papers will be reviewed by two members of the special track's program committee and two members of the general conference program committee, and acceptance decisions will be made by the conference program co-chairs. Proposals must include the following information:  
 Title of the special track. 
  Anticipated numbers of submissions and accepted papers. A track may have up to 4 sessions, with 3 papers per session. Special tracks that fail to attract sufficient papers will be merged into the general conference. 
  Names and contact information for the special track chair(s) and those who have agreed to serve on the special track's program committee. The program committee should be large enough for each paper to be reviewed by 4 reviewers. 
  Promotional plans and materials, including a draft call for papers, specific plans for publicizing the special track, and the names of any speakers you are considering inviting. (FLAIRS cannot guarantee any form of financial support for special track invited speakers at this stage.) 
  Summary of any special tracks you have organized for FLAIRS over the last two years. In particular, what track(s) have you organized, how many submissions were received, and how many papers were accepted?

 How Many? 
 FLAIRS-23 Accommodation, Location, Travel   
 Accommodation   
 FLAIRS room blocks closed.  Conference room blocks at the resort were only available until April 28. You can still book with the resort, but the conference rates will not be available. You can also find accommodation resources in the links under the Location, Travel section below.  
 If you book a room at The Shores outside of the conference block (e.g., conference block full, third party consolidator booking), please ensure that you still identify yourself to the resort as a FLAIRS attendee. This helps you, as the resort fee (above the room rate) is waived for FLAIRS-23 attendees, and it counts that booking for FLAIRS toward event contract requirements.  
 Group rates will be honored for attendees three (3) days before and three (3) days after the formal conference dates, based on availability.  
 FLAIRS-23 has also arranged the following consideration for attendees.  
 Resort fee waiver on room charges. Normally, The Shores charges a resort fee in addition to the room rate. This fee has been waived for FLAIRS-23 attendees, whether or not your room is booked within the conference block. 
  10% discount in Azure (restaurant) & Tiki Bar for breakfast, lunch & dinner. This applies both to registered attendees and to accompanying persons. Please note that this does not apply to room service. 
  A discounted specialty drink price at the Tiki Bar. 
  Resort Fee Clarification  - Some attendees have found discounted resort rates via 3rd party consolidators, such as Expedia and Hotels.com. If you consider such, please ensure that you understand the precise terms and conditions in the fine print. These often trade off significant flexibility (e.g., pre-paid, no cancellation or changes) for the lower rate.  
 In particular, though, we have had a question and clarification about the resort fee in this context. As part of our contract with the resort, the normal resort fee is waived for FLAIRS attendees. This is true, even if the room itself has been booked via a 3rd party, but only if the resort has control over the fee payment. Thus for 3rd party transactions, if the resort fee is already bundled into the consolidator's price, you would be opting-in to that bundled fee as part of the contract with the consolidator. In that case, the resort does not have control over the bundled fee, and the fee can not be retroactively removed by the resort from what was paid to the 3rd party. If the resort fee was not bundled as part of the 3rd party booking, then the resort fee should be waived for FLAIRS attendees, and the resort should not ask for payment of the fee above what was paid for the 3rd party booking.  
 In essence, for 3rd party bookings: if you paid a bundled resort fee to a 3rd party, it can not be removed; if the resort itself is asking you to pay the resort fee above and beyond your 3rd party room booking, then it should be waived for FLAIRS attendees.

 FLAIRS-23 Golf  
 Additional details may be available on Chad Lane's FLAIRS-23 Golf page  .  
 We'll plan to play before and after the conference as close to the following times as possible:  
 Tuesday May 18, 1pm (a morning round on Tuesday is also possible - just indicate your interest) 
  Saturday, May 22, 8am 
 Please contact Chad Lane (lane AT ict.usc.edu) as soon as possible if you would like to play.  
 NASCAR Racing Events  
 We did not receive enough stated interest from attendees to contract this as a formal FLAIRS-23 group event. If you are interested in the NASCAR experience, it may be possible for you to make individual arrangements. The ride-along (or even full driving) folk are on-track every Friday/Saturday in May, so the weekend before or just at the end of the conference are both options. Individual reservations can be made via The Richard Petty Driving Experience  (make sure to verify for the Daytona International Speedway, as they do similar experiences at different raceways).  
 Instructions for Paper Presenters  
 Each paper presentation room will have an an LCD projector and a laptop running Windows, with PowerPoint and Adobe Acrobat Reader installed. Presenters may use the laptop provided or they may use their own laptop. Presenters who use a conference laptop must bring their presentation in electronic form on either a USB drive or a CDROM.  
 Presenters should arrive at their session early, introduce themselves to the session chair, and verify that their presentation displays correctly. Each presentation is scheduled for 25 minutes, with 20 minutes for speaking and 5 minutes for questions. Session chairs will monitor the time and keep the sessions strictly on schedule.

 Article  Proceedings of the 23rd International Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society Conference, FLAIRS-23: Preface  
  Jie Liang 
 The carboxylation of lysine residues is a post-translational modification (PTM) that plays a critical role in the catalytic mechanisms of several important enzymes. It occurs spontaneously under certain physicochemical conditions, but is difficult to detect experimentally. Its full impact is unknown. In this work, the signature microenvironment of lysine-carboxylation sites has been characterized. In addition, a computational method called Predictor of Lysine Carboxyl­ation (PreLysCar) for the detection of lysine carboxylation in proteins with available three-dimensional structures has been developed. The likely prevalence of lysine carboxylation in the proteome was assessed through large-scale computations. The results suggest that about 1.3% of large proteins may contain a carboxylated lysine residue. This unexpected prevalence of lysine carboxylation implies an enrichment of reactions in which it may play functional roles. The results also suggest that by switching enzymes on and off under appropriate physicochemical conditions spontaneous PTMs may serve as an important and widely used efficient biological machinery for regulation.

   Preview Abstract  Influence maximization is an important research topic in complex networks, aiming to find a seed node set with the most significant ultimate influence in social networks. Recently, the I_WVoteRank algorithm proposed a semi-local extended neighborhood concept based on the WVoteRank algorithm, considering the 1-hop and 2-hop neighbors in the voting process to calculate the voting scores of nodes. However, it initializes the voting ability of all nodes to 1. In contrast, we propose a voting method called WVoteRank++, which initializes the voting ability of nodes to their degree. This approach is significant as it considers the node’s connectivity, thus providing a more accurate representation of its influence. To reduce the time complexity, we only update the voting scores of seed nodes and their influenced neighbors within three hops. Additionally, we introduce the concept of voting proportion, which measures the percentage of votes a node casts to its neighboring nodes. This concept is crucial in our algorithm as it helps determine the influence of a node on its neighbors. We use the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered and Linear Threshold models to simulate the spreading progress on six real and synthetic datasets. The experimental results show that, in most cases, the proposed algorithm outperforms other baseline methods regarding the final infected scale, the infection scale, and the LT model.

   Preview Abstract  Voice recordings constitute information that enriches previous studies on mood disorders in which sensor data that measure physical activity are used. The analysis of all these data is applied to mental health to prevent crises due to depression or mania mainly. This chapter analyzes voice records and the application of machine learning for the first classification of emotions (sadness, happiness, fear, etc.). Subsequently, the emotions detected will be associated with mood states (mania, depression, mixed, euthymia, etc.). The usefulness of voice recordings to improve diagnostic prediction in the classification of mood disorders is concluded.

   Preview Abstract  Attribute reduction has the ability to identify essential features, reduce feature dimensions, and improve the classification of learning models. The study of attribute reduction methods for ordered decision systems, which are data with preferred order relations, is a popular research topic. In this chapter, a heuristic attribute reduction method based on self-information is proposed by improving the computation of the approximation set. First, by choosing the triangular matrix form, we cleverly optimize the matrix computation process, which facilitates the storage of relations among multiple objects and saves time effectively at the same time. Second, we introduce a more efficient method to compute the approximation set, which further improves the computational efficiency of the algorithm. The adoption of self-information as the uncertainty measure considers both deterministic information and possible categorization information. Finally, the validation practice on multiple datasets fully proves the effectiveness of the algorithm. From the experimental results, the algorithm in this chapter can effectively remove irrelevant or redundant attributes, and at the same time, it is also more efficient compared to other algorithms due to the improved approximation set calculation method.

   Preview Abstract  Scalability challenges in recommender systems refer to the difficulties that arise when maintaining systems that can handle growing datasets. On the other hand, state-of-the-art recommender systems are focusing only on increasing the number of transactions (by using evaluation metrics based on rating or ranking). However, the success of a recommender system may be reflected in business metrics, such as increased sales, revenue, user retention, or customer satisfaction. In this chapter, we aim to overcome these two challenges together: “how to define own targets (evaluation metrics) on a recommender system?” and in the meanwhile “how to scale it on big data?”. We proposed a collaborative filtering method called “TOROS: Target Oriented O  (n)  Recommender System”. TOROS reduces the similarity calculation complexity from O  (n 2   )  to O  (n)  and it has been evaluated on both publicly available datasets and also real-world e-commerce datasets of an e-commerce services provider company Frizbit S.L. We have compared TOROS with state-of-the-art recommender system algorithms and evaluated based on time and space consumption yet. As future work, we also evaluate the efficiency of TOROS in terms of various business-specific targets.

   Preview Abstract  The equipment operational state detection is important in modern industry for reducing production costs and improving production efficiency. However, due to the complex and continuous nature of the papermaking process, analyzing paper break faults remains challenging. This chapter proposes a paper break fault classification and identification method based on a Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) and a Softmax classifier. A stacked autoencoder model is established and trained to extract deep features from the data, and a Softmax classifier is employed to identify paper breakage faults based on the extracted features. A case study with data collected from a real paper mill demonstrates that the classification model based on SAE feature extraction and Softmax classifier can effectively achieve paper break fault recognition.

   Preview Abstract  The interest in the use of the ChatGpt tool by professionals in the tourism sector is increasing, but the acceptance of this tool by these professionals is not the same for all, there being different factors that affect its acceptance. In this chapter, first, the interest in this topic is demonstrated by means of a bibliometric study formed by related scientific publications, second, a co-occurrence study is carried out on the publications found to determine the most significant variables, and, from them, lastly, to obtain the factors mentioned at the beginning, thus creating a theoretical adaptation of the technological adaptation model, that model how the tourism sector comes to accept and use ChatGpt. With this information, a company in the tourism sector has a theoretical evaluation model to measure the degree of acceptance of its workers toward ChatGpt tools, being able to distinguish the strongest points and having the opportunity to establish an adaptation strategy according to the weakest points.

   Preview Abstract  The study of metro flow has become a hot topic and an important research element in urban computing. Metro flow is affected by the topology of metro network and the POI around metro stations. It is a challenge to extract the effective patterns of metro flow from the complex data. In this chapter, we construct metro flow knowledge graph to depict the topological relations between metro stations, the relations between metro stations and POIs, and the relations between metro stations and flows. Since metro flow changes over time, we add the corresponding time constrain to each relation. In addition, due to the complexity of relations, the time granularity of the constraints on the relations varies. Therefore, for effective knowledge graph representation learning, we propose a multi-temporal granularity metro flow temporal knowledge graph (MGMF-TKG) embedding method. Specifically, first, we construct a metro flow temporal knowledge graph from metro flow data and use a combination of sinusoidal waves to represent temporal information. Then, a multi-time granularity knowledge graph representation learning framework is constructed to realize the representation of relations between entities under complex time information constraints. Finally, experiments are conducted using Chongqing metro flow data, and the experimental results show that the method outper-forms the benchmark methods.

  FLOPS specifically aims to promote cross-fertilization between theory  
  and practice and among different styles of declarative programming.  
  *** Scope ***  
  FLOPS solicits original papers in all areas of declarative programming:  
  * functional, logic, functional-logic programming, rewriting systems,  
  case studies.  
  FLOPS promotes cross-fertilization among different styles of declarative  
  programming. Therefore, research papers must be written to be  
  understandable by a wide audience of declarative programmers and  
  researchers. In particular, each submission should explain its  
  contributions in both general and technical terms, clearly identifying  
  what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant for its  
  area, and comparing it with previous work. Submission of system  
  descriptions and declarative pearls are especially encouraged.  
  *** Submission ***  
  Submissions should fall into one of the following categories:  
  must be written in English and can be up to 15 pages excluding  
  references, though system descriptions and pearls are typically shorter.  
  The formatting has to conform to Springer’s LNCS guidelines. FLOPS 2024  
  will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process.  
  The proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS series. We  
  expect to invite the authors of a selection of the best papers to submit  
  an extended version of their FLOPS paper to a special issue which will  
  appear in the journal Science of Computer Programming.  
  All deadlines are Anywhere on Earth (AoE = UTC-12).  
  * Abstract due: Wed 6th Dec 2023  
  * Submission deadline: Wed 13th Dec 2023  
  * Notifications: Wed 31st Jan 2024  
  * Final versions due: Wed 28th Feb 2024
