SISAP 2023   
  Oct 9-11, A Coruña, Spain   
 16th International Conference on  
  Similarity Search and Applications, SISAP 2023  
 The International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications (SISAP) is an annual forum for researchers and application developers in the area of similarity data management. It aims at the technological problems shared by numerous application domains, such as data mining, information retrieval, multimedia retrieval, computer vision, pattern recognition, computational biology, geography, biometrics, machine learning, and many others that need similarity searching as a necessary supporting service. Please see the call for papers (to be announced soon) for more details.  
 SISAP 2023 also features a doctoral symposium  . If you are a PhD student, please consider submitting a paper about your project.  
 The SISAP initiative ( www.sisap.org  ) is a forum to exchange real-world, challenging and innovative examples of applications, new indexing techniques, common test-beds and benchmarks, source code and up-to-date literature through its web page, serving the similarity search community. Traditionally, SISAP puts emphasis on the distance-based searching, but in general the conference concerns both the effectiveness and efficiency aspects of any similarity search problem.  
 A small selection of the best papers presented at the conference will be recommended for inclusion in a special issue of Elsevier Information Systems  . These extended versions will be subject to a second round of peer review at the journal.  
 There will be a Best Paper  and Best Student Paper Award  .  
 SISAP 2023 will take place in A Coruña, Spain  .  
 More details will be pulbished soon in this webpage.

 SISAP 2023 Indexing Challenge and Demo Track   
 The International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications (SISAP) is an annual forum for researchers and application developers in the area of similarity data management. It aims at the technological problems shared by numerous application domains, such as data mining, information retrieval, multimedia, computer vision, pattern recognition, computational biology, geography, biometrics, machine learning, and many others that use similarity search as a necessary supporting service. Machine learning, dense retrieval, and multimedia indexing have taken the scene of similarity search as the most challenging task among applications. This call reflects on this observation.  
 In 2023 we are launching the SISAP Indexing Challenge  with a test bed to compare new and existing indexing algorithms in three common tasks. Current data pools are in the order of several billion objects to train a generative deep neural network; we will be steering towards indexing datasets in this size in upcoming editions of this challenge. For this year, we are launching the challenge with datasets fitting on a single modern desktop computer, sized from ten million to one hundred million objects. We aim at providing a common test bed to compare new indexes, re-implementations of previously known indexes and an overview of the behavior of similarity search at various size scales.

 Reports   
 We expect that participants prepare a detailed report of their solution in a typical SISAP's shortpaper format  with a focus on reproducibility and comparing their speedup against a brute force solution in its machine and the resulting quality w.r.t. recall. Organizers and an ad-hoc committee will review these short papers if the number of papers is large, looking to increase the paper's quality. All participants can submit a report regardless of its final rank position. As in other SISAP's tracks and sessions, the acceptance will be based on the quality of contribution and the manuscript itself.
