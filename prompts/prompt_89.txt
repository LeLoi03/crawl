 Euro-Par covers a wide spectrum of topics from algorithms and theory to software technology and hardware-related issues, with application areas ranging from scientific to mobile and cloud computing.   
 Euro-Par provides a forum for the introduction, presentation and discussion of the latest scientific and technical advances, extending the frontier of both the state of the art and the state of the practice.   
 The main audience of Euro-Par are the researchers in academic institutions, government laboratories and industrial organisations. Euro-Par's objective is to be the primary choice of such professionals for the presentation of new results in their specific areas. As a wide-spectrum conference, Euro-Par fosters the synergy of different topics in parallel and distributed computing. Of special interest are applications which demonstrate the effectiveness of the main Euro-Par topics.   
 In addition, Euro-Par conferences provide a platform for a number of accompanying, technical workshops. Thus, smaller and emerging communities can meet and develop more focussed topics or as yet less established topics. The unique organizational structure of a Euro-Par conference, which puts the hosting team in charge of both the scientific programme and the local organization, makes it a particularly lively and stimulating experience.

 Writers Workshops  
 This is where your paper is discussed during the conference. The workshops group together the authors of up to five papers that thematically fit together. Shortly before the conference begins, we will publish the paper-to workshop assignments. If you are an author, use this page to find which workshop you are assigned to. Non-authors, please use the same page to decide which group you would like to join throughout the conference. All participants should download, print and read all the papers in their group before the conference.    
 EuroPLoP is the premier European conference on patterns and pattern languages. Design patterns are a unique and effective way to capture and share expertise, tacit knowledge and research findings.  
 Submission      
 Unlike other conferences, EuroPLoP focuses on improving papers instead of only presenting them. Authors will receive high quality feedback in a constructive way during the shepherding process and during the workshops at the conference. The feedback can be used to improve submitted papers for final publication.

   EuroPLoP   ™   
  European Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs  
 EuroPLoP  ™  is a conference that explores, develops and celebrates patterns in software. As with PLoP  ™  in the US, the main focus of EuroPLoP  ™  will be a series of writer's workshops where pattern authors work together to improve their patterns. In addition to these workshops there will be discussion groups, BOF sessions and working groups (similar to the Hot Topics at ChiliPLoP  ™  ), as well as time for games and relaxation.  
 All the EuroPLoP  ™  s to date have been held at Kloster Irsee  - a former Benedictine monastery in the heart of Bavaria, Germany. Its history can be traced back to the 12th century, and the buildings we see today were erected in the beginning of the 18th century. This beautiful and tranquil setting greatly contributes to the unique EuroPLoP  ™  atmosphere.
