 Celebrating its 20th anniversary, the International Symposium on Grids & Clouds (ISGC) 2023 will be held on 19~24 March 2023 at Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan. The HEPiX 2023 Spring Workshop   then will take place back-to-back on 27~31 March. The ISGC is one of the most important annual international events in Asia that brings together scientists and engineers worldwide to exchange ideas, to present on challenges, solutions and future development issues in the field of Open Data and Open Science.    
 The main theme of ISGC 2023 will focus on “accelerating time-to-science through computing”. Over the past two decades, the scientific research had been revolutionized by the infrastructure of distributed computing and the concept of open data. Compute-intensive research has once been a barrier for many researchers. Nowadays, the cloud and distributed computing infrastructure could provide researchers immediate access to an unlimited amount of computing power and allows them to ask questions that may not have been possible. Moreover, the virtual infrastructure allows researchers to share large-scale data. Reducing time to science is something every researcher wish to experience.    
 Promoting the open data/open science collaboration between Asia Pacific region and the world, the Symposium offers an excellent opportunity to learn from the latest achievement from Europe, America and Asia. The goal of ISGC is to create a face-to-face venue where individual communities and national representatives can present and share their contributions to the solutions of global challenges. We cordially invite and welcome your participation!

 International Symposium on Grids & Clouds 2022    
 The annual ISGC virtual conference will be held from 21 to 25 March of 2022. While the research data are becoming a real asset nowadays, it is an information and knowledge gained through thorough analysis that makes them so valuable. To process vast amounts of data collected, novel high performance data analytics methods and tools are needed, combining classical simulation oriented approaches, big data processing and advanced AI methods. Such a combination is not straightforward and needs novel insights at all levels of the computing environment – from the network and hardware fabrics through the operating systems and middleware to the platforms and software, not forgetting the security – to support data oriented research. Challenging use cases that apply difficult scientific problems are necessary to properly drive the evolution and also to validate such high performance data analytics environments.  
 EDITORIAL BOARD

 Through the parallel sessions, the impact of distributed computing infrastructures in a range of research disciplines was highlighted. Operational procedures, middleware and security aspects were addressed in a dedicated sessions.  
 The symposium was covered online in real-time by the GridCast team from the GridTalk project. A running blog including summarises of specific sessions as well as video interviews with keynote speakers and personalities and photos.  
 As with all regions of the world, grid and cloud computing has to be prove it is adding value to researchers if it is be accepted by them and demonstrate its impact on society as a while if it to be supported by national governments, funding agencies and the general public. ISGC has helped foster the emergence of a strong regional interest in the earth and life sciences, notably for natural disaster mitigation and bioinformatics studies.  
 Prof. Simon C. Lin organised an intense social programme with a gastronomic tour of Taipei culminating with a banquet for all the symposium’s participants at the hotel Palais de Chine.  
 I would like to thank all the members of the programme committee, the participants and above all our hosts, Prof. Simon C. Lin and his excellent support team at Academia Sinica.

  Topics of Interest  :   
  Disciplines across the Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities (SSAH) have critically engaged with technological innovations such as grid- and cloud computing, and, most recently, various data analytic technologies. The increasing availability of data, ranging from social media text data to consumer big data has led to an increasing interest in analysis methods such as natural language processing, social network analysis, machine learning and text mining. These developments pose challenges as well as opening up opportunities and members of the SSAH community have been at the forefront of discussions about the impact that novel forms of data, novel computational infrastructures and novel analytical methods have for the pursuit of science endeavors and our understanding of what science is and can be.  
  The ISGC 2023 SSAH track invites papers and presentations covering applications demonstrating the opportunities of new technologies or critically engaging with their methodological implications in the Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities. Innovative application of analytical tools for survey data, social media data, and government (open) data are welcome. We also invite contributions that critically reflect on the following subjects: (1) the impact that ubiquitous and mobile access to information and communication technologies have for society more generally, especially around topics such as smart cities, civic engagement, and digital journalism; (2) philosophical and methodological reflections on the development of the techniques and the approaches by which data scientists use to pursue knowledge.  
  2. Technologies that provide access and exploitation of different site resources and infrastructures   
  (10) Artificial Intelligence (AI)   
  During the last decade, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and statistical learning techniques have started to become pervasive in scientific applications, exploring the adoption of novel algorithms, modifying the design principles of application workflows, and impacting the way in which grid and cloud computing services are used by a diverse set of scientific communities. This track aims at discussing problems, solutions and application examples related to this area of research, ranging from R&D activities to production-ready solutions. Topics of interests in this track include: AI-enabled scientific workflows; novel approaches in scientific applications adopting machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques; cloud-integrated statistical learning as-a-service solutions; anomaly detection techniques; predictive and prescriptive maintenance; experience with MLOps practices; AI-enabled adaptive simulations; experience on ML/DL models training and inference on different hardware resources for scientific applications.

  ISIT 2023 will be hybrid. There is an "in-person track" and a "virtual track". Note the different submission deadlines for the two tracks  :  
 deadline for virtual track: | January 3, 2023 
  deadline for in-person track: | NEW: extended to February 5, 2023 
  Also note that the number of presentation slots in the virtual track is limited and that therefore a virtual presentation slot cannot be guaranteed.  
 The virtual track will consist of live presentations of one of the authors during the regular conference time in front of a mixed virtual and live audience, i.e., the in-person attendees of the conference will be able to join the virtual sessions live in the conference center. Pre-recorded videos will not be accepted.  
 ISIT 2023 will follow a soft double-blind reviewing policy  . For details see the conference website.  
 We look forward to welcoming you in Taipei!
