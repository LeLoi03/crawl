  About iFM  
 The Integrated Formal Methods (iFM) conference series  targets research in formal approaches that combine different methods for modeling and analysis. The conference covers a broad spectrum of topics: from language design, to verification and analysis techniques, to supporting tools and their integration into software engineering practice.

 Objectives and scope  
 In the last decades, we have witnessed a proliferation of approaches that integrate several modelling, verification and simulation techniques, facilitating more versatile and efficient analysis of software-intensive systems. These approaches provide powerful support for the analysis of different functional and non-functional properties of the systems, complex interaction of components of different nature as well as validation of diverse aspects of system behaviour. The iFM conference series is a forum for discussing recent research advances in the development of integrated approaches to formal modelling and analysis. The conference covers all aspects of the design of integrated techniques, including language design, verification and validation, automated tool support and the use of such techniques in software engineering practice. To credit the effort of tool developers, we use EAPLS artifact badging  .  
 Areas of interest include (but are not limited to):  
 Formal and semi-formal modelling notations 
  Formal methods for AI 
  Tools and case studies supporting the integration of formal methods 
  Paper Categories  
 iFM 2023 solicits high-quality papers reporting research results and/or experience reports related to the overall theme of formal methods integration.  
 We accept papers in the following categories:  
 (1) Regular papers (limit 16 pages) on  
 Regular and short papers must be original, unpublished, and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers will undergo a thorough review process. Submissions will be judged on the basis of significance, relevance, correctness, originality, and clarity.  
 The submissions will be reviewed and selected for publication based on the above-mentioned criteria as well as suitability to the conference’s technical program.The review process is single blind.  
 Submission guidelines  
 Submissions for all categories should be made using the iFM 2023 EasyChair site:  
 Submissions must be in PDF format, using the Springer LNCS style files.  
 Springer requires that authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines  and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. After a paper is accepted, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.  
 The conference proceedings will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. A special issue of the Formal Aspects of Computing  journal is planned for extended versions of selected papers from iFM 2023. We will apply for a special issue of the Original Software Publication  track in Science of Computer Programming  (see EAPLS Artifact Badging below).  
 All accepted papers must be presented at the conference. At least one author of each accepted paper must register to the conference by the early registration date.  
 EAPLS Artifact Badging  
 To credit the effort of tool developers, we plan to apply for a special issue of the Original Software Publication  track in Science of Computer Programming  . Authors of selected artifacts will be invited to contribute to this issue.

 Welcome to IFSA 2023  
 Welcome to IFSA 2023   
 It is our great pleasure to welcome everyone to the 20th World Congress of the International Fuzzy Systems Association (IFSA 2023), held at EXCO, Daegu, Korea, which is one of the most beautiful cultural cities in Korea with a historical wealth of cultural and tourist attractions that is located in the south-eastern area of Korea.  
 The conference is an international forum for researchers and practitioners to share ideas in all aspects of fuzzy theory and its applications. The major goal of this conference is to bring together practitioners and scholars from all areas to discuss, demonstrate, and exchange research ideas within the scope of intelligence including fuzzy theory and its applications. To provide better opportunities to disseminate the research results presented at the conference, accepted papers will be published in the proceeding of IFSA 2023 and selected papers will be recommended to several prestigious journals for extended results.  
 IFSA 2023 will provide the opportunity for researchers to discuss their latest research results through several technical programs that consist of two plenary lectures, special organized sessions, and oral/poster sessions. In addition to the technical program, social events will offer the opportunities of strengthening networks and interactions between the participants of IFSA 2023.  
 We would like to express our sincere appreciation to the committee members for their valuable contributions to this conference. Also we would like to express many thanks to societies, institutes, and companies for their sponsorship.  
 Hope you have a wonderful and stimulating stay in Daegu, KOREA.

 About Us   
 The International Fuzzy Systems Association (IFSA)  is a worldwide organization dedicated to the support, development and promotion of the fundamental issues of fuzzy theory related to (a) sets, (b) logics, (c) relations, (d) natural languages, (e) concept formation, (f) linguistic modeling, (g) vagueness, (h) information granularity, etc. and their applications to (1) systems modeling, (2) system analysis, (3) diagnosis, (4) prediction and (5) control in decision support systems in management and administration of human organizations as well as electro-mechanical systems in manufacturing and process industries. IFSA organizes and encourages participation in open discussion session on the future directions and restructuring of fuzzy theory in IFSA World Congresses  .
