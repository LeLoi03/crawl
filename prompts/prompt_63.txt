  Abstract  
 The book includes papers about various problems of dependable operation of computer systems and networks, which were presented during the 18th DepCoS-RELCOMEX conference. Their collection can be an interesting source material for scientists, researchers, practitioners, and students who are dealing with design, analysis, and engineering of computer systems and networks and must ensure their dependable operation. The increasing role of artificial intelligence algorithms and tools in modern information technology and computer engineering, especially rapid expansion of tools based on deep learning methods, calls for extending our view on system dependability. Selection of papers in these proceedings not only illustrates a wide-ranging variety of multidisciplinary topics which should be considered in this context but also proves that virtually all areas of contemporary computer systems and networks musttake into account an aspect of dependability.

 International Conference on Developments in eSystems Engineering  
 Developments of eSystems Engineering (DeSE) has been established in recognition of the escalating importance and relevance of electronic media, applications and devices in our everyday work, home and commercial environments. These systems have often arisen as solutions to domain specific problems, addressing areas of social science, business studies, engineering, auto, health studies, computer science, communications, geo-systems and most other academic and vocational subject areas. Accordingly developments and innovations in e-systems engineering have appeared through sources appropriate to their subject area with little heed paid to the actual underlying science of engineering an e-system. Therefore, it is the intention of DeSE to provide the increasingly essential forum dedicated to discussing and reporting on developments in the field of e-systems engineering; including all relevant research and practical advancements.  
 The areas of interest will, by the nature of the subject, be very wide: The science behind e-systems engineering will be advanced through the integrated approach of specifically considering e-systems development with the added advantage of transferable experience and knowledge across all individual subject areas. As the technology advances and users become more familiar with e-systems the impact of these systems is likely to be felt in many areas:  
 In education there is vast scope for the introduction of advanced eLearning  tools allowing students/pupils an improved level of independent learning.

  Over three decades ago, Prof. Dr. Roland Wagner  and Prof. Dr. A Min Tjoa  recognized the need for an international platform to address the rapidly growing fields of Databases and Expert Systems Applications. This vision gave birth to DEXA, a conference that began as a small gathering of innovative minds in Austria. Today, DEXA has evolved into a global event, attracting more than 5,000 participants—including distinguished speakers, researchers, developers, and industry experts—from around the world.  
 DEXA Organization  
 DEXA Conferences & Workshops  
 DEXA and its associated conferences and workshops are internationally renowned events, serving as a hub for scientists, developers, and practitioners. Each year, they come together to exchange ideas, present groundbreaking research, and share practical development experiences. The events cover a wide range of advanced topics, including: Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, Big Data Analytics & Knowledge Discovery, E-Government & Cyber-Physical Systems and Advanced Information Technologies.   
 Publications  
 Proceedings from DEXA conferences and workshops are published by Springer in their prestigious Lecture Notes in Computer Science  (LNCS) and Communications in Computer and Information Science  (CCIS) series. These publications provide a platform for the global scientific community to access the latest research and innovations presented at DEXA.   
 Whether you are a researcher, developer, scientist, or industry practitioner, DEXA offers a unique opportunity to engage with thought leaders, network with peers, and stay ahead of the curve in the ever-evolving landscape of information technology.

   The International Conference on the Theory and Application of Diagrams  
 Diagrams is a biannual, international and interdisciplinary conference series, covering all aspects of research on the theory and application of diagrams.  
 Recent technological advances have enabled the large-scale adoption of diagrams in a diverse range of areas. Increasingly sophisticated visual representations are emerging and, to enable effective communication, insight is required into how diagrams are used and when they are appropriate for use. The pervasive, everyday use of diagrams for communicating information and ideas serves to illustrate the importance of providing a sound understanding of the role that diagrams can, and do, play. Research in the field of diagrams aims to improve our understanding of the role of diagrams, sketches and other visualisations in communication, computation, cognition, creative thought, and problem solving. These concerns have triggered a surge of interest in the study of diagrams.  
 The study of diagrammatic communication as a whole must be pursued as an interdisciplinary endeavour. Diagrams attracts a large number of researchers from virtually all related fields, placing the conference as a major international event in the area.  
 Diagrams is the only conference that provides a united forum for all areas that are concerned with the study of diagrams: for example, architecture, artificial intelligence, cartography, cognitive science, computer science, education, graphic design, history of science, human-computer interaction, linguistics, logic, mathematics, philosophy, psychology, and software modelling.
