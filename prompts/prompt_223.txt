  POPL 2023  ( series  ) /  PADL 2023 ( series  ) /  PADL 2023: The 25th International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages  
 About 
  Declarative languages comprise several well-established classes of formalisms, namely, functional, logic, and constraint programming. Such formalisms enjoy both sound theoretical bases and the availability of attractive frameworks for application development. Indeed, they have been already successfully applied to many different real-world situations, ranging from database management to active networks to software engineering to decision support systems.  
 New developments in theory and implementation fostered applications in new areas. At the same time, applications of declarative languages to novel and challenging problems raise many interesting research issues, including designing for scalability, language extensions for application deployment, and programming environments. Thus, applications drive the progress in the theory and implementation of declarative systems, and benefit from this progress as well.  
 PADL is a well-established forum for researchers and practitioners to present original work emphasizing novel applications and implementation techniques for all forms of declarative programming, including functional and logic programming, database and constraint programming, and theorem proving.  
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Innovative applications of declarative languages 
  Novel uses of declarative languages in the classroom 
  Practical extensions such as constraint-based, probabilistic, and reactive languages 
  PADL 2023 especially welcomes new ideas and approaches related to applications, design and implementation of declarative languages going beyond the scope of the past PADL symposia, for example, advanced database languages and contract languages, as well as verification and theorem proving methods that rely on declarative languages.

 Submissions   
 PADL 2023 welcomes three kinds of submission:  
 Technical papers (max. 15 pages): Technical papers must describe original, previously unpublished research results. 
  Application papers (max. 8 pages): Application papers are a mechanism to present important practical applications of declarative languages that occur in industry or in areas of research other than Computer Science. Application papers are expected to describe complex and/or real-world applications that rely on an innovative use of declarative languages. Application descriptions, engineering solutions and real-world experiences (both positive and negative) are solicited. 
  Extended abstracts (max. 3 pages): Describing new ideas, a new perspective on already published work, or work-in-progress that is not yet ready for a full publication. Extended abstracts will be posted on the symposium website but will not be published in the formal proceedings. 
 Page numbers (and, if possible, line numbers) should appear on the manuscript to help the reviewers in writing their reports. So, for LaTeX, we recommend that authors use:  
 \pagestyle{plain} \usepackage{lineno} \linenumbers   The conference proceedings of PADL 2023 will be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science  series.  
 Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally published workshops proceedings may be submitted but the authors should notify the program chairs where it has previously appeared.  
 Important Dates   
 Abstract submission: October 12, 2022 (AoE)  
 Paper submission: October 19, 2022 (AoE)  
 Notification: November 15, 2022  
 Camera-ready papers: December 1, 2022  
 Symposium: January 16-17, 2023  
 Distinguished Papers   
 The authors of a small number of distinguished papers will be invited to submit a longer version for journal publication after the symposium. For papers related to logic programming, that will be in the journal Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)  , and for papers related to functional programming, in Journal of Functional Programming (JFP)  . The extended journal submissions should be substantially (roughly 30%) extended: explanations for which there was no space, illuminating examples and proofs, additional definitions and theorems, further experimental results, implementational details and feedback from practical/engineering use, extended discussion of related work, and so on. These submissions will then be subject to the usual peer review process by the journal, although with the aim of a swifter review process by reusing original reviews from PADL.
