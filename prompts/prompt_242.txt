 RSS is a single-track conference that connects researchers working on all aspects of robotics including scientific foundations, mechanisms, algorithms, applications, and analysis of robotic systems. The single-track format gives attendees an opportunity to learn about state-of-the-art research in all areas of robotics. The conference will consist of oral and poster presentations of accepted papers, demonstrations, invited talks, and panels.  
 The conference will preserve the RSS tradition of selecting excellent papers via a thorough and fair review process. Paper submissions will be evaluated in terms of their novelty, technical quality, significance, potential impact, and clarity.  
 The conference will include the category of Demo contributions, similar to conferences in related research areas, resulting in a Demo Track during the main conference.  
 Important Dates  
 Detailed submission instructions are available here  .   
  The review process will continue RSS’ strong tradition in emphasizing quality, fairness, and rigor. Reviews for RSS papers of all types, i.e., “science”, “systems” and “demo” papers, will remain blind. As in previous iterations of the conference, authors are encouraged to submit “systems” papers and the program committee will be encouraged to evaluate them by gauging their potential impact and usefulness to the community. 
 The conference includes a rebuttal stage. The submissions will undergo an initial review process and initial decisions will be announced by March 17  . The submissions above the threshold will have one week to prepare a short rebuttal to address the reviewers’ and Area Chair’s concerns and provide clarifications. An Area Chair meeting will finalize decisions, taking into account both the initial reviews and the rebuttal, by April 10  . 
  Subject Areas  
 RSS seeks high-quality research papers and demos that introduce new ideas and stimulate future trends in robotics. We invite paper and demo submissions in all areas of robotics, including:  
 Assembly, Logistics and Manufacturing; 
  Assistive, Entertainment and Service Robots;

 Author Information  
  There are two types of submissions to RSS: (i) Science/Systems papers, and (ii) Demo papers. Both types of papers appear in the RSS proceedings.  
 Science/Systems papers report on novel scientific and systems contributions via a conference paper, and are reviewed via a double-blind review process. Demo papers must be accompanied by a conference demonstration (see details below), and can be reviewed via a single-blind review process as the demonstration content may reveal the affiliation of the authors.  
 A single contribution should only be submitted as one type, either a Science/System paper or a Demo paper. If there is a novel robotic systems contribution that is properly evaluated against alternatives and does not obviously reveal the authors, the authors should submit it as a Science/System paper. If the authors’ contribution entails a demonstration and cannot be easily anonymized, authors should submit it as a Demo paper.  
 Details on the two types of submission and guidance for preparation are provided below.  
 Guidance for Demo Preparation  
 useful new mechanisms or software packages for the robotics community, 
  large-scale deployments of robotics technology that have not been achieved before, 
  mature, production-ready industrial systems of note and lessons from their operation, 
  new datasets and benchmarks that will advance robotics research, 
  novel applications of robotics technology with important societal impact. 
  What to Submit?  Each submitted Demo paper will include a manuscript describing the system (see format and length recommendations below) and demonstrations of the system itself, which can be accessed by reviewers via the supplementary material (e.g., executable software, multimedia showing the operation of robotic hardware, demonstrations of the achieved scalability, etc.), or via a link to a website that is accessible at the time of the review period.  
 Single-blind:  Demo paper submissions are allowed (but not required) to be single-blind in contrast to Science/System papers, which must be double-blind. Demo paper submissions are understood to be demonstrating unique systems that will obviously reveal the authors or their affiliations. Demo papers are not opportunities to bypass the double-blind requirement of Science/System submissions. The reviewers will be asked to evaluate whether a submission was appropriately submitted under the Demo paper category.  
 Submission Requirements:  The authors of Demo paper submissions are required to start the title of the submission with the word “Demonstrating” to communicate to the reviewers the type of the submission and that they are allowed to be single-blind. The authors of Demo papers are also asked to include a short 1-paragraph section at the time of the submission titled “Intended Demonstration” (e.g., before or after the introduction section of their submitted manuscript), of how they envision that the RSS live audience will experience the demonstrated system. See examples of ways to demonstrate a system below. This section can be removed at the time of the Camera-Ready submission, if the Demo paper is accepted.  
 Conference Demonstration:  Authors of accepted demo papers will be asked to demonstrate their system to the RSS attendees. Examples of how this can be achieved include: (i) an interactive demonstration of a software package at the conference, (ii) live demonstration of robotic hardware brought at the conference, (iii) videoconferencing to demonstrate a remote real-world deployment of a robotic system’s abilities. The authors of demo papers are asked to describe at the time of the submission how the RSS live audience will experience the demonstrated system.  
 Evaluating Demo Papers:  A Demo paper should outline the design of the system and provide sufficient details to allow the evaluation of its validity, quality, and relevance to RSS. A Demo paper can do this by addressing some of the following questions:  
 What problem does the proposed system address? 
  Why is the system important and what is its impact? 
  How is the system licensed? 
  Are there any additional concerns about the proposed system (e.g., ethical or environmental concerns)? 
  Review and Camera-ready:  The review process for Demo paper submissions will take place in parallel with the review of Science/System paper submissions. It will be handled by the same Program Committee. The proposed demonstrated system needs to be ready at Camera-Ready time to allow the proposed demonstration to take place. Additional improvements are allowed but should not diverge significantly from the description in the submitted Demo paper.  
 Examples of Demo Papers  The Demo paper category was introduced in RSS 2023 and examples of accepted submissions are the following:  
 Demonstrating Mobile Manipulation in the Wild: A Metrics-Driven Approach 
  Demonstrating Large Language Models on Robots 
  Demonstrating RFUniverse: A Multiphysics Simulation Platform for Embodied AI 
  Demonstrating Arena-Web: A Web-based Development and Benchmarking Platform for Autonomous Navigation Approaches 
  Note:  Commercial sales and marketing activities are not appropriate for submissions in the RSS Demo Track and should be arranged instead via the RSS Sponsorship program.   
 Paper and Demo Format  
 A template for paper and demo submissions is available in LaTeX  and Word  . Do not modify the formatting provided in the templates. Any change to font sizes, page dimensions, line spacing, etc. may delay publication. Please do not include any additional markings such as Draft or To appear in…  on the pages. Make sure your paper does not contain page numbers.  
 We only accept a PDF format for the main submission file. Delays in the production of proceedings are usually caused by PDF file submissions that do not embed all fonts.  
 Before submitting your PDF file, please open it in Acrobat Reader. In the File menu under Document Properties, you will find information on the fonts used by your document. The PDF file must only contain Type-1 fonts (and Embedded True Type fonts if prepared under Word). On Linux, you may also use pdffonts  . Below are instructions to embed PDF fonts for various typesetting systems:  
 Overleaf 
  Acrobat 
  dvips 
  Paper and Demo Length  
 The main PDF should contain a concise and lucid presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of its contributions, prior work, and a description of key technical ideas and methods used. The paper must include a “Limitations” section, describing shortcomings and open problems related to the proposed contribution.  The paper should be self-contained and include all the material necessary for an expert to verify the central claims in the paper.  
 Additional supplemental text, such as appendices, data listings, or expanded proofs, should be included as supplementary material (see below). Reviewers will review supplemental material at their discretion for Science/System papers. For Demo papers, the reviewers will be guided to prioritize the supplemental material if the system is primarily available through the corresponding files.  
 Authors should anticipate that their papers may be rejected if the key technical result is not concisely presented. Reviewers may perceive a paper as too long if it is verbose, repetitive, or belabors obvious points. A paper that is 15 pages long is not necessarily going to be rejected, but the authors must make a compelling case that the length is essential to the key ideas in the paper. Moreover, the aesthetics of a paper also make the case for conciseness, since too much whitespace and poorly cropped figures are detrimental to the “feel” of a high-quality paper. Conversely, reviewers may perceive a paper as too short if it omits important details.  
 Note:  RSS was inspired to make this decision following other conferences, such as SIGGRAPH and FOCS. Researchers have wasted untold hours massaging formatting rules, figure sizes, and trimming paragraphs to fit page limits. The nominal reason for page limits in the electronic era is an upper bound on reviewers’ effort since they are expected to review “all the material” in the submission. It is inevitable that reviewers do not review material uniformly and will skim over text that is uninteresting or too dense; hence, page length is a poor proxy for reviewer effort. We will trust that authors will recognize that respecting reviewers’ time is a necessary condition to get published.   
 Double-Blind Submission for Papers  
 The following principles should be applied for submissions in the Science/System paper category:  
 Authors’ names and affiliations should not appear anywhere in the title or text of the submission. 
  Acknowledgments to people or funding agencies should not appear in the submission. 
  There should be no links to external websites (e.g. YouTube, github, authors institute pages) in the blinded submission. Links to external resources can be provided in the final camera-ready version of the paper. 
  In self-citing authors previous work, avoid expressions such as “In the authors earlier work…”, rather use alternative expressions such as “In previous work…” or “In related work…”, in a manner that does not distinguish their own work from the work of others. Authors should otherwise cite work, including their own, as required for the completeness of the submission.  
 In presentation of experimental work, avoid logos in pictures, or overt references to an individual laboratory. Use expressions such as “The experimental equipment…” rather than “The University of XYZ’s Robby the Robot…”. Otherwise, authors should include photographs, graphics and other presentation material as in the normal manner for a paper submission.  
 Note:  Demo submissions are allowed (but not required) to be single-blind in contrast to science and systems papers, which must be double-blind.   
 Supplementary Materials for Papers and Demos  
 Authors may submit supplementary material such as a video or an expanded version of a proof. Especially in the context of Demo papers, authors are asked to provide supplementary material that allow the reviewers to experience and evaluate the demo. The deadline for supplementary material is a few days after the paper submission deadline.  
 Note that reviewers of Science/System paper submissions are not required to view this material and include it in their assessment of the paper.  
 Authors of Science/System papers must ensure that all external links are removed for the initial and revised submissions, to ensure that their identities are not revealed for regular papers.  External links are welcome to be included in the final camera-ready version of the paper.  
 Multiple Submissions of Papers and Demos  
 RSS submissions that are identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences are not appropriate for RSS and violate the conference’s dual submission policy.  
 Exceptions to this rule are the following:  
 Submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops that do not have published proceedings, or with only abstracts published. 
  It is acceptable to submit to RSS work that has been made available as a technical report (or similar, e.g., in arXiv) without citing it. 
  None of the above should be construed as overriding the requirements of other publishing venues. In addition, keep in mind that author anonymity to RSS reviewers might be compromised for authors availing themselves of exceptions 1 and 2.  
 Plagiarism in Papers and Demos  
 RSS is intolerant of plagiarism. Submitted papers are expected to contain original work executed by the authors with adequate, proper, and scholarly citations to the work of others. It is the job of the authors to clearly identify both their own contribution(s) and published results / techniques on which they depend or build. RSS reviewers are charged to ensure these standards are met. In cases of alleged plagiarism, the program chair will be guided by Section 8.2.4 Allegations of Misconduct as laid out by the IEEE in this document  .  
 Policy on the Use of Large Language Models  
 We are following the example of ICML  and adopt the following policy:  
 Papers that include text generated from a large language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, are prohibited unless the produced text is presented as a part of the paper’s experimental analysis. Note the following clarification on the above statement:  
 The policy prohibits text produced entirely by LLMs (i.e., “generated”). This does not prohibit authors from using LLMs for editing or polishing author-written text. 
  The policy is largely predicated on the principle of being conservative with respect to guarding against potential issues of using LLMs, including plagiarism. 
  This policy may evolve in future conferences as society understands LLMs and their impacts on scientific publishing better. 
  We plan to investigate any potential violation of the LLM policy when a submission is brought to our attention with a significant concern about a potential violation. Any submission flagged for the potential violation of this LLM policy will go through the same process as any other submission flagged for plagiarism.

 Call for Papers  
 RTAS is a top-tier conference with a focus on systems research related to embedded systems and time-sensitive systems. RTAS’23 invites papers describing original systems, applications, case studies, methodologies, and algorithms that contribute to the state of practice in design, implementation, verification, and validation of embedded systems or time-sensitive systems. RTAS’23 consists of two tracks:  
 Track 1. Systems and Applications; 
  Track 2. Applied Methodologies and Foundations. 
  The broad scope of RTAS’23 ranges from traditional hard real-time systems to embedded systems without explicit timing requirements. In both tracks, the timing requirements of interest include not only classical hard real-time constraints, but also time-sensitive applications in a broader sense, including applications subject to probabilistic, soft real-time, quality-of-service (QoS), or latency requirements. The application area can be either resource-constrained embedded systems or other time-sensitive systems of any size, including (but are not limited to): time-sensitive cloud/edge/fog computing systems, time-sensitive applications in the Internet of Things (IoT), time-sensitive mobile computing apps, timing aspects in robotics middleware and frameworks, machine learning in or for time-sensitive systems, real-time control in smart cities and other large cyber-physical systems (CPS), signal processing algorithms that must execute in real time, and real-time healthcare solutions.  
 RTAS welcomes both papers backed by formal proofs as well as papers that focus exclusively on empirical validation of timing requirements. Track 1 further welcomes applied systems papers that focus on practical issues other than timing, such as security, energy-awareness, and fault tolerance, in the broader field of embedded/CPS/IoT systems and applications.  
 RTAS’23 follows a double-blind peer reviewing process: author identities and affiliations will not be revealed to reviewers. Authors will have the opportunity to provide a rebuttal of reviews before acceptance decisions are made, solely to provide clarifications and correct misconceptions. The rebuttal will not allow authors to introduce new material beyond the original submission, or promise such material for the camera-ready version. There will be an optional evaluation process for accepted papers that assesses the reproducibility of the work.  
 Track 1: Systems and Applications  
 This track focuses on research of an empirical nature pertaining to applications, runtime software, and hardware architectures for time-sensitive or embedded systems. Applied systems papers that target embedded systems do not necessarily need to consider timing issues. Topics relevant to this track include, but are not limited to:

 Call for Papers 
 RTNS is a friendly and inclusive conference with a great sense of community that presents excellent opportunities for discussion and collaboration.  
  This 31st occurrence of RTNS is a special one. First, this 31st edition will be the first occurrence outside France. Second, RTNS offers now two deadlines: one in September, and a second in January (more details below).  
  Important dates  
  First round  
  Abstract submission: Sept. 18th, 2022  
  Paper submission: Sept. 22th, 2022  
  Notification: Nov. 10th, 2022  
  Second round  
  Abstract submission: Jan. 13th, 2023  
  Paper submission: Jan. 17th, 2023  
  Notification: Feb. 25th, 2023  
  Original unpublished papers on all aspects of real-time systems and networks are welcome. Note that RTNS prefers original results, raising questions and discussions, to technical advances understandable only by a few experts.  
  RTNS covers a wide spectrum of topics in real-time and embedded systems, including, but not limited to:  
  * Real-time applications design and evaluation: automotive, avionics, space, railways, telecommunications, process control, multimedia.  
  * Hardware support for real-time systems: hardware/software co-design, power/temperature-aware techniques, design of predictable hardware, multi-core and many-core platforms, hardware accelerators, cache-related issues, interconnect, and memory.  
  Double submission model  
  --------------------------------------  
  RTNS 2023 adopts a double submission model, with two rounds.  
  Submissions done at the first round may be:  
  Rejected: no re-submission possible to the second round  
  Accepted: accepted papers will receive a DOI, the list will be published on the conference WEB site, and the author may put an author version on their own web page. The publication will occur after the conference.  
  Under major revision: the paper may be re-submitted in the second round and will be evaluated again by the same reviewers.  
  Submissions done in the second round may be only accepted or rejected.  
  Submission Guidelines  
  --------------------------------------------  
  Authors are invited to submit English-language research and application papers representing original, previously unpublished work, not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. The papers are limited to 10 two-column pages (not including references) in ACM conference format. The proceedings will be published by well known editor (ongoing discussions). RTNS accepts only full papers. All accepted papers can extend to 11 pages (excluding references) with the extra page only to address reviewers’ comments but not to add new content.  
  RTNS tends to be a community, not a bunch of individual experts. Then, authors are invited to present the results in a way such that the main ideas can be understood by any real-time researcher and lead to discussions and exchanges.  
  As in previous editions, some specific proposal will be done to authors of outstanding papers (discussions still ongoing). Best papers and best student papers awards will be presented at the conference, along with an award for the best presentation.
