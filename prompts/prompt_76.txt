 Submission Instructions  
 Submit a Paper   
 Identifiers.  Authors must submit abstracts by January 20 and full papers by January 27. When submitting abstracts, authors must supply their Semantic Scholar and DBLP ids.  
 Format.  The body of the submission (excluding the title page and the bibliography) may be up to 18 pages long. The title page should only contain the title, submission number, and the abstract. In addition, an appendix of arbitrary length may be included at the end of the paper only for the review process (i.e., an appendix will not appear if the paper is published). This appendix will be read at the discretion of the reviewers. To add the submission number to the title page, one must first submit a paper without a number, see what number was assigned, and then revise the submission to include this number. The body of the submission should contain a clear presentation of the contributions of the paper, including a discussion of prior work and an outline of the key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. The submission as a whole should include all of the ideas necessary for an expert to fully verify the central claims in the paper. Submitted papers will be evaluated on significance of the contribution, originality, relation to prior research, technical quality, and exposition.  
 LaTex style files.  Authors are required to format their submissions using the EC’23 LaTex style files  (updated: Jan 4, 2023), which uses a single-column format with 10-point font. Papers that do not use the EC’23 LaTex style files or violate the page limit will be rejected without review.  
 Tracks.  Each submission must select one of four tracks that differ along methodological dimensions. The reviewing process of each track will be overseen by the corresponding Track Chair(s), who are primarily responsible for ensuring that consistent reviewing standards are applied to all papers in the same track. Authors should consider the description of the tracks to evaluate which track best captures the research community according to whose standards their paper should be reviewed. The list of conferences/journals is only a sample meant to indicate the research community and typical methodological approach, but authors from any research community are welcome to submit to any of the tracks. EC’23 will use the following four tracks:  
 Theory: | Typical papers in this track make progress on existing theoretical problems, propose new ones, or introduce significant new techniques that could be applied more broadly. These papers are often similar in methodology to papers that are published in FOCS, STOC, SODA, ICALP, JACM, Econometrica, JET, TE, or Math of OR. | Track chairs | : Shuchi Chawla (University of Texas), Brendan Lucier (Microsoft Research), and Philipp Strack (Yale University). 
  Applied Modeling: | Typical papers in this track propose and analyze novel models that capture real-world phenomena or provide fresh perspectives on previously studied applied problems. These papers are often similar in methodology to papers that are published in Operations Research, Management Science, RAND Journal of Economics, or MSOM. | Track chairs: | Daniela Saban (Stanford University) and Alex Teytelboym (University of Oxford). 
  Empirics: | Typical papers in this track draw significant insights from real or synthetic data, through access to new data sources or experiments, or through novel analysis of existing data sources. These papers are often similar in methodology to papers that are published in the Journal of Marketing Research, Management Science, Marketing Science, Organization Science, Strategic Management Journal, Experimental Economics, Quantitative Marketing and Economics, Review of Economics and Statistics, or MSOM. | Track chair: | Denis Nekipelov (University of Virginia) 
  AI: | Typical papers in this track study the design or analysis of intelligent agents or intelligent systems, broadly construed. These papers are often similar in methodology to papers that are published in AAAI, IJCAI, NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, UAI, TARK, AAMAS, AIJ, JAIR, JMLR, or MLJ. | Track chair: | Felix Brandt (Technical University of Munich) 
  Areas.  Each submission must select several content areas from the list provided below. Note that the areas are partially overlapping; if in doubt, authors are advised to select those area(s) that best fit their paper. Content areas will be used to match papers with a member of the Area Chair who is assigned to at least one of the paper’s areas. Area Chairs are responsible for shepherding papers through the review process and for making accept/reject recommendations to the Program Chairs.  
 Auctions and pricing 
  Behavioral economics and bounded rationality 
  Social choice & voting theory 
  Social networks and social learning 
  STOC submissions.  Authors who have had submissions to STOC 2023 rejected may submit (potentially revised) versions of those papers to EC 2023, including in the submission the STOC reviews and author response, by Wednesday, February 22. (Abstracts need not be registered in advance.) These papers should be submitted using the submission link above.  
 Review process.  Each paper will be reviewed in detail by at least two referees.  
 There will be two stages of review, with some decisions announced on March 3 after first-round reviews, and the remaining decisions announced on May 1 after a second round of reviews. Between March 28-31, authors of papers undergoing second-round reviewing will be able to submit responses to the reviews, which will be taken into account by the review team.  
 The review process is double blind. Authors must take measures to ensure that their identity is not easily revealed from the submission itself. Authors should refer to their prior work in a neutral manner (i.e., instead of saying “We showed” say “XYZ et al. showed”).  
 Submission of code and data.  In the interest of reproducibility, authors of papers that include empirical results are strongly encouraged to submit their code and data. Such material should be archived as a single zip file and submitted as supplementary material.  
 One-page extended abstract option.  To accommodate the publishing traditions of different fields, authors of accepted papers can ask that only a one-page abstract of the paper appear in the proceedings, along with a URL pointing to the full paper. Authors should guarantee the link to be reliable for at least two years. This option is available to accommodate subsequent publication in journals that would not consider results that have been published in preliminary form in conference proceedings. Such papers must be submitted electronically and formatted just like papers submitted for full-text publication.  
 Submission of publicly available work (e.g., papers on arXiv).  It is acceptable to submit work that has been presented in public (provided there are no published proceedings) or has been uploaded to arXiv or similar online archives, provided the submission itself is anonymized.  
 Simultaneous submissions to journals.  As in prior years, it is acceptable to simultaneously submit papers to EC’23 and to a journal, or to submit papers that are already under review at a journal, including papers that have already received a “revise and resubmit”, as long as the paper has not been accepted for publication prior to the EC submission deadline, and provided that the authors intend to publish the paper as a one-page abstract in EC. Papers that are accepted at EC’23 and appear as a one-page abstract can subsequently be submitted for publication in a journal but may not be submitted to any other archival conference (i.e., with published proceedings).  
 No other simultaneous submissions.  The following submissions are not allowed: (a) papers that are currently under review at another archival conference, (b) papers that have been accepted for publication in a journal or archival conference before the EC’23 submission deadline, (c) papers containing results that have previously been published in a journal or archival conference.  
 Highlights beyond EC.  Papers that have already been published (or have been accepted for publication) in conferences or journals other than EC can be nominated (including self-nominations) for inclusion in a special plenary session at EC’23 called “Highlights beyond EC”, which is intended to highlight some of the best work in economics and computation that has appeared elsewhere. The corresponding call for nominations will be announced soon.  
 Forward to journal:  Authors of accepted papers will have the option to select the forward-to-journal option to have the reviews forwarded to a journal of their choice. Our partner journals are:  
 ACM Transactions on Economics and Computatio | n 
  Theoretical Economics 
  TheoretiCS 
  When submitting the camera-ready version of their papers, authors of accepted papers can (optionally) choose the forward-to-journal option and specify at most one journal. Those authors may then submit a journal version of their paper to the chosen journal, with a deadline of August 15, 2023. The cover letter to the journal should specify that the submission is part of the EC’23 forward-to-journal process. For each paper that has chosen the forward-to-journal option, the EC’23 reviews will be forwarded (along with reviewer identities) to the chosen journal on August 15, 2023.  
 For consideration in Games and Economic Behavior, Econometrica, Journal of Economic Theory, Management Science, Marketing Science, Quantitative Marketing and Economics, RAND Journal of Economics, Review of Economic Studies, Social Choice and Welfare, or Theoretical Economics, authors of accepted papers must select the one-page extended abstract option for the proceedings version, explained above. For consideration in the International Journal of Game Theory, the full paper can be published in the EC proceedings, although the introduction and structure of the journal version will typically be different from the EC version. Other journals may require additional content beyond the EC proceedings version; it is the responsibility of authors to ensure that the version submitted to a journal conforms with any journal-specific expectations regarding the prior proceedings version. A journal’s participation in the EC forward-to-journal option does not mean that other forms of prior publication are acceptable.  
 We emphasize that the ultimate disposition of the paper is within the editorial discretion of each journal; in particular, there is no guarantee of acceptance if the forward-to-journal option is chosen. However, we do anticipate that this process should result in a faster decision from the journal.  
 Conflict of interest.  Authors will have the opportunity to declare conflicts of interest (COIs) with Track Chairs, Senior Program Committee members, or others. This must be done separately for each submission. Declaring COIs prevents the specified people from reviewing a paper, thereby constraining the matching process and so potentially negatively impacting review quality. For this reason, COIs should not be declared automatically based on a prior relationship. Instead, when declaring COIs, Authors are asked to follow the ACM Conflict of Interest Policy  . Track Chairs and Senior Program Committee members can also declare a conflict of interest with authors as well as with specific papers.  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy  will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

 Submission Instructions  
 Submit a Paper   
 Identifiers.  Authors must submit abstracts by January 20 and full papers by January 27. When submitting abstracts, authors must supply their Semantic Scholar and DBLP ids.  
 Format.  The body of the submission (excluding the title page and the bibliography) may be up to 18 pages long. The title page should only contain the title, submission number, and the abstract. In addition, an appendix of arbitrary length may be included at the end of the paper only for the review process (i.e., an appendix will not appear if the paper is published). This appendix will be read at the discretion of the reviewers. To add the submission number to the title page, one must first submit a paper without a number, see what number was assigned, and then revise the submission to include this number. The body of the submission should contain a clear presentation of the contributions of the paper, including a discussion of prior work and an outline of the key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. The submission as a whole should include all of the ideas necessary for an expert to fully verify the central claims in the paper. Submitted papers will be evaluated on significance of the contribution, originality, relation to prior research, technical quality, and exposition.  
 LaTex style files.  Authors are required to format their submissions using the EC’23 LaTex style files  (updated: Jan 4, 2023), which uses a single-column format with 10-point font. Papers that do not use the EC’23 LaTex style files or violate the page limit will be rejected without review.  
 Tracks.  Each submission must select one of four tracks that differ along methodological dimensions. The reviewing process of each track will be overseen by the corresponding Track Chair(s), who are primarily responsible for ensuring that consistent reviewing standards are applied to all papers in the same track. Authors should consider the description of the tracks to evaluate which track best captures the research community according to whose standards their paper should be reviewed. The list of conferences/journals is only a sample meant to indicate the research community and typical methodological approach, but authors from any research community are welcome to submit to any of the tracks. EC’23 will use the following four tracks:  
 Theory: | Typical papers in this track make progress on existing theoretical problems, propose new ones, or introduce significant new techniques that could be applied more broadly. These papers are often similar in methodology to papers that are published in FOCS, STOC, SODA, ICALP, JACM, Econometrica, JET, TE, or Math of OR. | Track chairs | : Shuchi Chawla (University of Texas), Brendan Lucier (Microsoft Research), and Philipp Strack (Yale University). 
  Applied Modeling: | Typical papers in this track propose and analyze novel models that capture real-world phenomena or provide fresh perspectives on previously studied applied problems. These papers are often similar in methodology to papers that are published in Operations Research, Management Science, RAND Journal of Economics, or MSOM. | Track chairs: | Daniela Saban (Stanford University) and Alex Teytelboym (University of Oxford). 
  Empirics: | Typical papers in this track draw significant insights from real or synthetic data, through access to new data sources or experiments, or through novel analysis of existing data sources. These papers are often similar in methodology to papers that are published in the Journal of Marketing Research, Management Science, Marketing Science, Organization Science, Strategic Management Journal, Experimental Economics, Quantitative Marketing and Economics, Review of Economics and Statistics, or MSOM. | Track chair: | Denis Nekipelov (University of Virginia) 
  AI: | Typical papers in this track study the design or analysis of intelligent agents or intelligent systems, broadly construed. These papers are often similar in methodology to papers that are published in AAAI, IJCAI, NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, UAI, TARK, AAMAS, AIJ, JAIR, JMLR, or MLJ. | Track chair: | Felix Brandt (Technical University of Munich) 
  Areas.  Each submission must select several content areas from the list provided below. Note that the areas are partially overlapping; if in doubt, authors are advised to select those area(s) that best fit their paper. Content areas will be used to match papers with a member of the Area Chair who is assigned to at least one of the paper’s areas. Area Chairs are responsible for shepherding papers through the review process and for making accept/reject recommendations to the Program Chairs.  
 Auctions and pricing 
  Behavioral economics and bounded rationality 
  Social choice & voting theory 
  Social networks and social learning 
  STOC submissions.  Authors who have had submissions to STOC 2023 rejected may submit (potentially revised) versions of those papers to EC 2023, including in the submission the STOC reviews and author response, by Wednesday, February 22. (Abstracts need not be registered in advance.) These papers should be submitted using the submission link above.  
 Review process.  Each paper will be reviewed in detail by at least two referees.  
 There will be two stages of review, with some decisions announced on March 3 after first-round reviews, and the remaining decisions announced on May 1 after a second round of reviews. Between March 28-31, authors of papers undergoing second-round reviewing will be able to submit responses to the reviews, which will be taken into account by the review team.  
 The review process is double blind. Authors must take measures to ensure that their identity is not easily revealed from the submission itself. Authors should refer to their prior work in a neutral manner (i.e., instead of saying “We showed” say “XYZ et al. showed”).  
 Submission of code and data.  In the interest of reproducibility, authors of papers that include empirical results are strongly encouraged to submit their code and data. Such material should be archived as a single zip file and submitted as supplementary material.  
 One-page extended abstract option.  To accommodate the publishing traditions of different fields, authors of accepted papers can ask that only a one-page abstract of the paper appear in the proceedings, along with a URL pointing to the full paper. Authors should guarantee the link to be reliable for at least two years. This option is available to accommodate subsequent publication in journals that would not consider results that have been published in preliminary form in conference proceedings. Such papers must be submitted electronically and formatted just like papers submitted for full-text publication.  
 Submission of publicly available work (e.g., papers on arXiv).  It is acceptable to submit work that has been presented in public (provided there are no published proceedings) or has been uploaded to arXiv or similar online archives, provided the submission itself is anonymized.  
 Simultaneous submissions to journals.  As in prior years, it is acceptable to simultaneously submit papers to EC’23 and to a journal, or to submit papers that are already under review at a journal, including papers that have already received a “revise and resubmit”, as long as the paper has not been accepted for publication prior to the EC submission deadline, and provided that the authors intend to publish the paper as a one-page abstract in EC. Papers that are accepted at EC’23 and appear as a one-page abstract can subsequently be submitted for publication in a journal but may not be submitted to any other archival conference (i.e., with published proceedings).  
 No other simultaneous submissions.  The following submissions are not allowed: (a) papers that are currently under review at another archival conference, (b) papers that have been accepted for publication in a journal or archival conference before the EC’23 submission deadline, (c) papers containing results that have previously been published in a journal or archival conference.  
 Highlights beyond EC.  Papers that have already been published (or have been accepted for publication) in conferences or journals other than EC can be nominated (including self-nominations) for inclusion in a special plenary session at EC’23 called “Highlights beyond EC”, which is intended to highlight some of the best work in economics and computation that has appeared elsewhere. The corresponding call for nominations will be announced soon.  
 Forward to journal:  Authors of accepted papers will have the option to select the forward-to-journal option to have the reviews forwarded to a journal of their choice. Our partner journals are:  
 ACM Transactions on Economics and Computatio | n 
  Theoretical Economics 
  TheoretiCS 
  When submitting the camera-ready version of their papers, authors of accepted papers can (optionally) choose the forward-to-journal option and specify at most one journal. Those authors may then submit a journal version of their paper to the chosen journal, with a deadline of August 15, 2023. The cover letter to the journal should specify that the submission is part of the EC’23 forward-to-journal process. For each paper that has chosen the forward-to-journal option, the EC’23 reviews will be forwarded (along with reviewer identities) to the chosen journal on August 15, 2023.  
 For consideration in Games and Economic Behavior, Econometrica, Journal of Economic Theory, Management Science, Marketing Science, Quantitative Marketing and Economics, RAND Journal of Economics, Review of Economic Studies, Social Choice and Welfare, or Theoretical Economics, authors of accepted papers must select the one-page extended abstract option for the proceedings version, explained above. For consideration in the International Journal of Game Theory, the full paper can be published in the EC proceedings, although the introduction and structure of the journal version will typically be different from the EC version. Other journals may require additional content beyond the EC proceedings version; it is the responsibility of authors to ensure that the version submitted to a journal conforms with any journal-specific expectations regarding the prior proceedings version. A journal’s participation in the EC forward-to-journal option does not mean that other forms of prior publication are acceptable.  
 We emphasize that the ultimate disposition of the paper is within the editorial discretion of each journal; in particular, there is no guarantee of acceptance if the forward-to-journal option is chosen. However, we do anticipate that this process should result in a faster decision from the journal.  
 Conflict of interest.  Authors will have the opportunity to declare conflicts of interest (COIs) with Track Chairs, Senior Program Committee members, or others. This must be done separately for each submission. Declaring COIs prevents the specified people from reviewing a paper, thereby constraining the matching process and so potentially negatively impacting review quality. For this reason, COIs should not be declared automatically based on a prior relationship. Instead, when declaring COIs, Authors are asked to follow the ACM Conflict of Interest Policy  . Track Chairs and Senior Program Committee members can also declare a conflict of interest with authors as well as with specific papers.  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy  will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.
