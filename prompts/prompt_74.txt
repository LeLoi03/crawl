  DOI 
 We are soliciting papers presenting original research on all aspects of model-based engineering. Two types of submissions are possible:  
 Foundation Papers, dealing with modeling foundations, such as metamodeling, model transformations, model validation, verification and testing, model engineering methods and tools, and related aspects. 
  Application Papers, dealing with the application of modeling techniques, including experience reports on the use of MBE methods and tools, industrial case studies, or successful applications of MBE practices in industry or in public administration, with significant modeling lessons learned. All applications must have been done in real contexts and at least one of the authors of the paper must be from the company or administration where the application took place. 
  Submission process   
 Submissions must conform to the JOT LaTeX template  and must not exceed 14 pages (including figures, references, and appendices). Failure to conform to these guidelines may result in disqualification of the paper. No simultaneous submission to other publication outlets (either a conference or a journal) is allowed; any concurrent submission will be deemed as a serious breach of scientific ethics, resulting in the immediate rejection of the paper and appropriate action will be taken.  
 All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee.  
 All papers have to be submitted electronically in PDF format through Easychair  .  
  Tools and initiatives for the successful adoption of MBE in industry. 
  Review criteria and process   
 All papers will be assessed by the program committee in terms of their novelty, significance, technical quality, rigor, and suitability for the conference.  
 Contributions can be submitted to any of the two submission periods. In both rounds, the each submitted paper can be recommended by the Program Committee to be accepted-as-is, accepted with minor revisions, undergo major revisions or rejected.  
 Papers accepted at any of the two rounds with major or minor revisions will be given a specified period of time to perform the revisions and re-submit. The same reviewers will assess how well the revision requests have been addressed by the authors, and whether the final paper maintains or improves the level of contribution of the original submission. Revisions that significantly lessen the contribution of the work or that fail to adequately address the reviewers’ original concerns will result in the paper’s rejection. Papers not accepted but with a sufficient level of quality may be encouraged to be re-submitted next year, or alternatively as regular JOT articles, hence continuing their review process through the normal journal channels.  
 Papers will be published in the JOT journal as soon as they are accepted and one of their authors registers at the conference.  
 Artifacts   
 Artifacts are recommended, but not required, for the initial submission. Depending on the papers, reviewers may take the existence of artifacts as a positive signal about the work. Also depending on the papers, artifacts may be required as a condition for publication.  
 Publication   
 All accepted papers will be published as platinum open-access journal publication in JOT. At least one author for each accepted paper must register before the early registration deadline and present the paper during the conference. Failure to do so will result in the paper being withdrawn from the proceedings.

 ECMS Conference Aims  
 The human capacity to abstract complex systems and phenomena into simplified models has played a critical role in the rapid evolution of our modern industrial processes and scientific research. As a science and an art, Modelling and Simulation have been one of the core enablers of this remarkable human trace, and have become a topic of great importance for researchers and practitioners. The increasing availability of massive computational resources, and interconnectivity has helped fuel tremendous advances in the field, collapsing previous barriers and redefining new horizons for its capabilities and applications.  
 The International ECMS Conference on Modelling and Simulation   is dedicated to help define the state of the art in the field. For several years, ECMS has proven to be an outstanding forum for researchers and practitioners from different fields involved in creating, defining and building innovative simulation systems, simulation and modelling tools and techniques, and novel applications for modelling and simulation.  
 In 2023 this conference is going to be organized by the University of Florence   June 20 – 23  
 The conference will address the following topics:  
 Supply Chain Management, Logistics and Transportation 
 ASMTA – EPEW – PASM

  ECOOP 2023  
 ECOOP is Europe’s longest-standing annual Programming Languages conference, bringing together researchers, practitioners, and students to share their ideas and experiences in all topics related to programming languages, software development, systems and applications. ECOOP welcomes high quality research papers relating to these fields in a broad sense.  
 ECOOP is committed to affordable open access publishing. Recent year’s publications have been published by Dagstuhl’s LIPIcs series  under a Creative Commons CC-BY license where the authors retain their copyright. ECOOP articles have been published without open access publishing fee and can be accessed via a DOI. LIPIcs is indexed in DBLP, Google Scholar, Scopus and others.

 Highlights  
 This ECOOP edition continues the last edition’s innovations, embracing the entire landscape of programming technologies with a revised reviewing and publishing model:  
 Broader Scope.  ECOOP welcomes contributions in all aspect of practice and theory of programming languages, systems and environments, ranging the whole spectrum from novel ideas to evaluation of existing solutions. Authors can pick one of four broad categories: research papers  , reproduction studies  , experience papers  , and brave new ideas  or pearls  . Negative results and short papers are welcome. 
  Continuous Submissions.  ECOOP is moving towards frequent submission deadlines. ECOOP 2023 has two rounds of submissions, one in December and the second in March. Each round is double-blind  and delivers its results within two months  . 
  Collaborative Reviewing.  ECOOP encourages constructive reviewing where papers that are not accepted outright are given clear and actionable suggestions for improvements so that they can be resubmitted in subsequent rounds; thus, following the reviewing model of many journals but with timely reviews. Unlike conference reviewing, the same reviewers will remain attached to a submission throughout the process even if it takes multiple rounds. 
  Frictionless Submission.  ECOOP enforces neither strict page limits nor strict formatting requirements for submitted papers. Instead, we encourage authors to write what the clearest possible submission while keeping in mind that reviewers can only spend the same finite  amount of time on each paper. 
  Artifacts Now.  Artifacts supporting the scientific claims of papers can now submitted together with their paper and thus all authors will benefit from the feedback of the artifact evaluation committee. 
  Open Access.  ECOOP remains committed to open access, all papers appearing the proceedings of the conference, all talks, and all artifacts will be archived and made available free of charge and without author processing fees. 
  Journal First.  ECOOP papers can be submitted to special issues of three journals, TOPLAS, Science of Computer Programming and the Journal of Object Technology. The requirements of these journals apply for submissions. For SCP and JOT, the ECOOP program committee will act as reviewers with the same deadline. TOPLAS follow its own process. JOT is open access. 
  Journal After.  Selected papers will be invited to publish extended versions in special issues of our associated journals. An extended abstract of the paper will appear in the ECOOP proceedings. Journal after submission at SCP and JOT are reviewed by the ECOOP PC, while TOPLAS uses its own process.

Please follow the instructions provided to you by your track chair to allow for enough time for Q&A. Please go to your allocated room 15 minutes before the session start time to meet with the Session Chair (see technical program), review the pronunciation of your name, and familiarize yourself with the room and A/V set up, if needed (see Rehearsal and equipment check). You are expected to use your own laptop for presentations, which needs to be connected via HDMI. Some dongles (USB-C) may be available but bring your own adapter if needed. For ISSTA and ECOOP presentations, the A/V system is set up such that it will capture the screen, presenter, and audio, which will be streamed for remote participants via Zoom. Note that you do not need to join a Zoom meeting, simply plug in your device and use the wireless microphone provided. 
  ISSTA-Online presentations:  Presentation slots are 10 minutes. Prepare for 7.5 minutes of presentation and 2.5 minutes of Q&A. You will be required to present via Zoom. Please join the zoom meeting for your online session 15 minutes before the session start time. The zoom meeting details will be shared separately before the main conference. To avoid complications, please install the latest Zoom application on your computer and do not present via a web browser. Make sure your Zoom setup is working properly by running the Zoom audio/video test before joining the call. If your presentation contains any audio, you must enable the sharing of audio when sharing your screen. When you have finished your presentation, please stop sharing your screen and mute your microphone. 
  Rehearsal and equipment check:  We have reserved room G04 for presentation rehearsal and equipment testing. The A/V setup is identical in all conference rooms. If your set up works in G04, it should work everywhere.
