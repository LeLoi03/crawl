 ACM Multimedia 2023 calls for research papers presenting novel theoretical and algorithmic solutions addressing problems across the domain of multimedia and related applications. The conference also calls for papers presenting novel, thought-provoking ideas and promising (preliminary) results in realizing these ideas.  
 The conference invites research papers of varying length from 6 to 8  pages, plus additional pages for the reference pages; i.e., the reference page(s) are not counted towards the page limit of 6 to 8 pages. Please note that there is no longer a distinction between long and short papers, but the authors may themselves decide on the appropriate length of the paper. All papers will undergo the same review process and review period.  
 Questions: Please send your inquiries to: acmmm2023pc@gmail.com

  The conference invites papers in four major themes of multimedia: Engagement, Experience, Systems and Understanding.  
 Theme: Engaging users with multimedia  
 The engagement of multimedia with society as a whole requires research that addresses how multimedia can be used to connect people with multimedia artifacts that meet their needs in a variety of contexts. The topic areas included under this theme include:  
 This area seeks novel processing of media-related information in any form that can lead to new ways of interpreting multimedia content. Examples include processing of image, video, audio, music, language, speech, or other sensory modalities, for interpretation, knowledge discovery, and understanding.
