 Call for Papers  
 The 29th ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP) seeks to present exciting, innovative research related to the design implementation, analysis, evaluation, and deployment of computer systems software.  
 Topics  
 SOSP takes a broad view of the systems area and solicits contributions from many fields of systems practice, including, but not limited to: operating systems, file and storage systems, distributed systems, cloud computing, mobile and edge systems, secure and reliable systems systems aspects of big data and machine learning, embedded and real-time systems, virtualization, and management and troubleshooting of complex systems. We also welcome work that explores the interaction of computer systems with related areas such as computer architecture networking, programming languages, verification, and databases. In keeping with SOSP tradition, we will favor work that explores new territory, continues a significant research dialogue, or reflects on experience with or measurements of state-of-the-art implementations.

 Submission Criteria  
 Papers will be judged on novelty, significance, interest, clarity relevance, and correctness. A good paper will:  
 Motivate a significant problem; 
  Propose and implement an interesting, compelling solution; 
  Demonstrate the practicality and benefits of the solution; 
  Draw appropriate conclusions; 
  Clearly describe the paper's contributions; and 
  Clearly articulate the advances beyond previous work. 
 We encourage submission of groundbreaking work in significant new directions, with the understanding that evaluation criteria for papers addressing new problems may be different from those continuing a line of work in a more established area.  
 Originality  
 Submissions should contain original, unpublished material. Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism is not allowed.  
 Submissions that extend the authors' previous work are welcome, but authors must explain the differences between the SOSP submission and the prior work, much in the same way as the authors are expected to articulate the contributions of their submission as they relate to prior work by others.  
 Prior or concurrent workshop publication does not preclude publishing a related paper in SOSP. Authors should email the program co-chairs a copy of the related workshop paper and a short explanation of the new material in the conference paper beyond that published in the workshop version. As long as there is significant additional content in the submission compared to the prior workshop publication, the PC will evaluate the submission's entire contribution, not just the delta.  
 Prior or concurrent publication in non-peer-reviewed contexts, like arXiv.org, technical reports, talks, and social media posts, is explicitly permitted.  
 Author Response Period  
 SOSP will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to final consideration of the papers at the program committee meeting. Authors must limit their responses to (a) correcting factual errors in the reviews or (b) directly addressing questions posed by reviewers. Responses should be limited to clarifying the submitted work. In particular, responses must not include new experiments or data, describe additional work completed since submission, or promise additional work to follow. As PC members are not required to review supplementary materials responses must not rely on the existence of those materials. (See details below.)  
 Anonymity  
 SOSP will use double-blind reviewing. Please make a good faith attempt to anonymize your submission. Avoid identifying yourself or your institution explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). The first page should use the paper ID assigned during registration in place of the author names. If the name of your project or system is already known to the community (e.g., through technical reports, talks, social media posts, or other use), your SOSP submission must use an anonymized name.  
 Use care in referring to your own related work. Do not omit references to your prior work, as this would make it difficult for reviewers to place your submission in its proper context. Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. For example, you might say "Our system modifies the XYZ operating system built by Lee et al. [Lee17]". For concurrent submissions, cite an anonymized version of the concurrent submission and discuss the relation between the submissions, and email the PC chairs a copy of your other concurrent submission.  
 Check with the program chairs if you are uncertain about the anonymity rules.  
 Formatting  
 Papers will be submitted electronically in PDF format via the web submission form  .  
 Authors may optionally include supplementary material, such as formal proofs or analyses, as a separate document; PC members are not required to read this material, so the submission must stand alone without it. Supplementary material is intended for items that are not critical for evaluating the paper but may be of interest to some readers.  
 Submissions violating these rules will not be considered for publication, and there will be no extensions for fixing violations. We encourage you to upload an early draft of the paper well before the deadline to check if the paper meets the formatting rules.  
 Most of these rules are automatically applied when using the official SIGPLAN Latex or MS Word templates from the ACM  .  
 Conflicts  
 To avoid conflicts of interest in the review process, when you register and submit your paper, we ask that you provide information about conflicts between any of the authors of your submission and PC members. Use the following guidelines to determine conflicts:  
 Institutional:  You are currently employed at the same institution, have been previously employed at the same institution within the past two years, or are going to begin employment at the same institution.  
 The PC may review paper conflicts to ensure the integrity of the reviewing process, adding conflicts if necessary. Similarly if there is no basis for conflicts provided by authors, such conflicts may be removed (e.g., do not improperly identify PC members as a conflict in an attempt to avoid having an individual review your paper). If you have any questions about conflicts please contact the program co-chairs.  
 PC members will not be able to review, read the reviews of or participate in discussions of papers they are conflicted with. The review process for papers conflicted with both PC chairs will be managed by another PC member designated as the "conflict chair". For any papers co-authored by the PC chairs the conflict chair will be asked to hold them to a higher standard of being a "clear accept".  
 Submission Information  
 Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format via the web submission form

 Any questions about paper submissions can be emailed to sosp23-pc-chairs@mpi-sws.org  .

 Symposium Organizers  
 Overview  
 The 2023 Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS) will bring together an interdisciplinary group of researchers and practitioners in human computer interaction, security, and privacy. The program will feature:  
 Technical papers, including replication papers and systematization of knowledge papers 
  Workshops and tutorials 
  Replicating or extending important previously published studies and experiments 
  Systematization of knowledge papers that integrate and systematize existing knowledge to provide new insight into a previously studied area 
  Paper Registration:  Technical papers must be registered by February 10, 2023  . Registration is mandatory for all papers. Registering a paper in the submission system requires filling out all the fields of the online form that describe the submission, but does not require uploading a PDF of the paper. This information must describe the paper accurately, in sufficient detail to assign appropriate reviewers. Placeholder, incomplete, or inaccurate titles and abstracts may result in rejection without review.   
 Paper Submission:  Technical papers must be uploaded as PDFs by February 16, 2023  (but note the mandatory February 10 registration deadline above). All submissions must follow the guidelines described below. Submissions that violate any of the requirements below may be rejected without review.   
 Contact the program chairs prior to submission at soups23chairs@usenix.org  if you have any questions about these requirements.  
 Format and Page Limits:  Papers must use the SOUPS formatting template (available for MS Word  or LaTeX  ) and be submitted as a PDF via the web submission system  . Submissions must be no more than 12 pages (excluding acknowledgments, bibliography, and appendices). For the body of your paper, brevity is appreciated, as evidenced by the fact that many published papers in prior years have been well under this limit.   
 Submissions may include as many additional pages as needed for references and for supplementary material in appendices. The paper should stand alone without the supplementary material. We encourage authors to use the appendices for content that is peripheral to the main contributions of the paper but that may interest some readers or that may facilitate replication. Note that members of the program committee are free to not read this material when reviewing the paper. Camera-ready versions of accepted papers have an official limit of 12 pages (excluding acknowledgements, bibliography, and appendices) and 20 pages total including references and appendices. The program committee chairs will grant any extension they determine reasonable to accommodate references and supplemental material.  
 Paper Content:  Papers need to describe the purpose and goals of the work, cite related work, show how the work effectively integrates usability or human factors with security or privacy, and clearly indicate the innovative aspects of the work or lessons learned as well as the contribution of the work to the field. The paper abstracts should contain a sentence summarizing the contribution to the field and literature.  
 All submissions must clearly relate to the human aspects of security or privacy. Papers on security or privacy that do not address usability or human factors will not be considered. Likewise, papers on usability or human factors that do not address security or privacy will not be considered. The determination of whether a paper is within scope will be solely at the discretion of the program committee chairs.  
 Your paper and research approach—including research instruments—should be inclusive and respectful. A variety  of guidance  exists  on this topic. Please be sure to follow guidance on language use from the USENIX Statement on Racism and Black, African-American, and African Diaspora Inclusion  .  
 Systematization of Knowledge Papers:  We are soliciting Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers that integrate and systematize existing knowledge to provide new insight into a previously studied area of usable security or privacy. SoK papers should draw on prior work to put forth a new taxonomy, argument, or observation in an area in which substantial work has already been done. SoK papers should be more than a survey or summary of prior work in an area. SoK papers will be held to the same scientific and presentation standards as other technical papers. Please prefix the title of these papers with “SoK:” and check the SoK checkbox on the submission form to flag them for the review process.  
 Replication Papers:  In addition to original work, we are soliciting well-executed replication studies that meaningfully confirm, question, or clarify the result under consideration. Please prefix the title of these papers with the word “Replication:” for the review process.  
 Replication papers should aim to replicate important/influential findings from the literature. They may not necessarily offer new or unexpected findings; papers confirming previous findings are also considered contributions. Replication of a result that has already been replicated many times is less valuable. Replication of an obscure study that originally had only minimal influence on the community is less valuable. Authors should clearly state why they conducted a replication study, describe the methodological differences precisely, and compare their findings with the results from the original study.  
 Replication papers will be held to the same scientific standards as other technical papers. They should use currently accepted methodologies and technologies. Authors should not reuse outdated methods/technologies simply because they were used in the original paper. Replications may follow the same protocol as the original study, or may vary one or more key variables to see whether the result is extensible (e.g., re-running a study with a sample from a different population).  
 Anonymous Submission:  Reviewing is anonymous. No names or affiliations should appear on the title page or in the body of the paper, acknowledgments should be removed, and papers should avoid revealing the authors' identities in the text. Any references to the authors' own work should be made in the third person, as if it was work by someone else.  Appendices and figures should also be de-identified (e.g., do not leave logos or contact info on study materials, and remove identifying URLs from screenshots). Please ensure all author names, affiliations, URLs, etc. have been removed; even minor mistakes may result in rejection without review. Contact the program chairs at soups23chairs@usenix.org  if you have any questions.  
 Overlap with Previous Papers:  USENIX policy  prohibits simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, and plagiarism. SOUPS further prohibits the submission of substantially similar work to multiple venues. On the recommendation of a program chair, USENIX may take action against authors who have committed these practices. Any overlap between your submitted paper and other work either under submission, previously published, or submitted elsewhere before the SOUPS notification deadline must be documented in an explanatory note sent to the chairs. If a subsequent overlapping submission is made during the review process, the chairs should be notified. State precisely how the two works differ in their goals, share experiments or data sources, and offer unique contributions. If the other work is under submission elsewhere, the program committee may ask to review that work to evaluate the overlap. Please note that program committees frequently share information about papers under review and reviewers usually work on multiple conferences simultaneously. Technical reports, e.g., arXiv reports, are exempt from this rule. If in doubt, please contact the program chairs at soups23chairs@usenix.org  for advice.  
 Self-plagiarism includes verbatim or near-verbatim use of one's own published work without citing the original source, and is generally not acceptable. In some cases, it may be acceptable to include a brief  portion of selected content from the introduction, background, related work, or methods of a closely related paper. In these cases, the original paper must be explicitly referenced and the overlap should be clear to the reader. The reused content must not be part of the main contributions of the paper and, where possible, rewriting the text is preferred. Papers with significant text reuse may be rejected because of too much overlap. If in doubt, please contact the program chairs at soups23chairs@usenix.org  for advice.  
 Appendices:  Authors may attach to their paper supplementary appendices containing study materials (e.g., survey instruments, interview guides, etc.) that would not otherwise fit within the body of the paper. These appendices may also include any material that could assist reviewers with questions that fall outside the stated contribution of your paper on which your work is to be evaluated. Appendices can include links (e.g. to a working prototype or source code repository or data repository); please include full links (not shortened ones), and try to use long-term archives like osf.io or Dataverse for online appendices. Reviewers are not required to read any appendices, so your paper should be self-contained without them. We note that in recent years, inclusion of study materials as appendices has become very common, and reviewers may choose to refer to appendices for clarification or confirmation. Accepted papers will be published online with their supplementary appendices included.  
 Conflicts of Interest:  The submission system will request information about conflicts of interest between the paper's authors and program committee (PC) members, including a brief explanation. It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify their potential conflict-of-interest PC members, according to the following definition. A paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member when one or more of the following conditions holds:  
 The PC member shared an institutional affiliation with the author in the prior two years. 
  The PC member was the advisor or advisee of the author at any time. 
  The PC member has collaborated or published with the author in the prior two years. 
  The PC member is serving as the sponsor or administrator of a grant that funds the author's research. 
  The PC member is a close personal friend or relative of the author. 
  We recognize that special circumstances may exist, such as deep personal animosity. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the program chairs at soups23chairs@usenix.org  .  
 Ethical Research:  User studies should follow the basic principles of ethical research, including beneficence (maximizing the benefits to an individual or to society while minimizing harm to the individual), minimal risk (appropriateness of the risk versus benefit ratio), voluntary consent, respect for privacy, and limited deception. Studies that rely on crowdworkers can incur additional ethical obligations, including but not limited to paying a fair wage. If images of participants are included in the paper, make sure that these images will not create a potential risk for participants and that the informed consent covers the potential publication of participant images.  
 All papers, especially those with human subjects studies, are expected to discuss ethical considerations. Risks and benefits of the presented research should be weighed. Methodological decisions should be justified. Authors may be asked to provide additional explanations should questions arise during the review process.  
 If your organization or institution requires formal clearance for research with human subjects, your paper may be rejected if clearance was not obtained. However, such clearance alone does not guarantee acceptance and the program committee may reject a paper on ethical grounds.  
 Early Rejections:  Papers that receive substantially negative initial reviews will be rejected early. The authors of early-rejected papers, and only such papers, will receive a copy of their initial reviews. At this point, papers are no longer considered under submission (except if authors appeal).  
 Authors who substantively disagree with the reviews can appeal to the program committee chairs. Authors' appeals must clearly and explicitly identify concrete disagreements with factual statements in the initial reviews. Appealing a submission that was rejected early will keep it under consideration, and it cannot be withdrawn or resubmitted elsewhere until the final notification of acceptance or rejection.  
 Response:  A response period will occur after the second round of reviews. Authors will be given a chance to see reviews, and they may provide a short response that will be considered in subsequent discussions. Due to time constraints, the response period is fairly short. Please ensure that you reserve enough time between April 20–27 for the response process. Late responses will not be accepted.   
 Publication:  Accepted papers will be published by the USENIX Association, and will be freely available on the USENIX and SOUPS websites. Authors will retain copyright of their papers. Authors may also release pre-prints of their accepted work to the public at their discretion.  
 Presentation:  For accepted papers, we encourage at least one of the paper authors to attend the conference and present the work. However, it will be possible for authors of accepted papers to present remotely with permission from the PC Co-Chairs. If global health concerns persist, alternative arrangements will be made on a case-by-case basis, in line with USENIX guidance  .

  What is Software Process Improvement and Capability Determination (SPICE)?  
  The need for an international software standard  
 The goal of any company developing software is to produce high-quality software  using a productive and efficient team. However, this doesn't always happen due to gaps or inefficiencies in existing development processes -- issues that development teams  are not always aware of.  
 Lacking information about the what is  state, development teams cannot initiate improvements to reach a what should be  state. That is why undertaking a detailed assessment of the software development process is important. Ideally, this assessment should follow internationally accepted frameworks  and standards.  
 Here are some benefits of adopting an international standard:  
  Organizations can initiate and sustain | continuous improvements | in software processes. 
  Program managers can ensure alignment between software in development and | organizational goals | and needs. 
  ISO/IEC provides a suite of standards to undertake such an assessment in a systematic manner. These standards were developed under the SPICE project.  
  SPICE goals, objectives and benefits  
 People from more than 20 countries were involved in SPICE development. Their primary goal was to develop a consistent and validated framework for software process assessment to improve the quality and productivity of software development processes.  
 The SPICE standard creates a way to measure process capability and describe the preferred order in which activities should occur in a software development project. At the same time, it avoids a specific improvement approach as in other models, like the Capability Maturity Model  . SPICE emphasizes an organization's management and process definition structures.  
 For software suppliers, SPICE helps determine the capabilities of their own software processes. It helps them create a clear roadmap that highlights the gaps and areas of improvement in software processes. It also helps software suppliers  set priorities to better manage their improvement initiatives.  
 Software acquirers can use SPICE to determine software suppliers' processes and gauge their overall current and potential capability before investing in a supplier or their software.  
 For process assessors, SPICE provides a systematic and standardized framework to articulate the various aspects of assessments to be conducted on developed software.  
  How different organizations can use SPICE  
 Organizations can use the SPICE standard in three modes:  
 Capability determination mode. | For purchasing organizations to determine the capability of a potential software supplier. 
  Process improvement mode. | For software organizations to improve their development and | maintenance 
  Self-assessment mode. | For software organizations to assess their ability to implement a new | software project | . 
  Any company that uses the SPICE standard can get maximum benefits by first defining their why  :  
 to understand a software process 
  to initiate process improvement 
  to determine process capability 
    The SPICE reference model is divided into three modes and includes two dimensions: process and capability. Process is divided into five categories, and each process category is defined by six capability levels.     
  SPICE explained  
 Processes are divided into five categories:  
  Project. | Processes that establish the project and coordinate and | manage its resources. 
  Organization. | Processes that establish business goals and develop assets to meet those goals. 
  Each process is also defined by capability levels. A capability level is a set of common features or activities that work together to enhance an organization's or development team's capability to perform a process. Under SPICE, these capability levels are numbered from levels 0 to 5:  
 0: Not performed 
  1: Performed informally 
  5: Continuously improving 
  Process capabilities can also acquire process attributes, numbered c.x, where c is the capability level as mentioned above and x is a number associated with a specific, related attribute. Thus, 2.1 represents performance management, 2.2 represents work product management and so on.  
 The SPICE standard provides a set of documents that are used as a framework to assess software processes. This SPICE document suite contains nine parts, which are explained below.  
  The SPICE document suite  
 The SPICE document suite consists of a number of documents organizations can use during various software development phases, including -- but not limited to -- planning, development, monitoring, controlling, supply, support, etc.  
   Parts 1-6 of the SPICE document suite address process assessment, while parts 7 and 8 address process improvement or process capability determination.     
  Of the nine SPICE documents, parts 1-6 address aspects related to process assessment. Parts 7 and 8 address the use of process assessment for process improvement or process  
  capability determination. Here is a brief look at these documents.  
 Part 1 -- Concepts and introductory guide  
 This document lays down the requirements for constructing assessment instruments and provides guidance around the usability characteristics of these instruments. An assessment instrument is a tool to evaluate the adequacy or existence of practices. It enables an assessor to judge how well the practices have been implemented. It also helps them to record the collected information.  
 Part 6 -- Qualification and training of assessors  
 This document describes the assessor's competencies, education, training and experience. Whenever any software process is assessed using SPICE, at least one qualified assessor should be part of the assessment team. This person ensures that the assessment meets all requirements, checks the consistency of results, and confirms that other team members have the necessary specialized knowledge and skills  to carry out the assessment.  
 Part 7 -- Guide for use in process improvement  
 This document includes an overview of process improvement, a methodology for process improvement, the required cultural aspects for successful process improvement and the management perspective of process improvement. It acts as a guide to use process assessments to understand the current state of processes and to create process improvement plans.  
 The guide presents approaches to determine both core process capability and extended process capability.  
 Part 9 -- Vocabulary  
 This document specifies the vocabulary, consisting of definitions, related terms and concepts used in the SPICE standard.  
 See  software development trends to watch for   and how demand is increasing for  low-code app development platforms   . Also, explore  software development and testing tips   and ways to  balance app innovation with app security   .

 What is SPICE?  
 Originally SPICE was a project funded by the European Union. The main goal of this project was to develop a counterpart to CMMI, especially focused on Small and Medium Enterprises.  
 SPICE is an abbreviation and stands for " S  oftware P  rocess I  mprovement and C  apability d E  termination". Even if software development was the main driver of the initiative at that time, the "S" in SPICE is nowadays used for the entire system development.
