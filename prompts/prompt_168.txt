 The conference was a fantastic event with a large number of highly interesting technical presentations. The topics showcased the current research areas in the industry and the challenges associated with them. The opportunity to network with like-minded people enabled interesting discussions and inspired and motivated me for my further research. Special thanks must go to the excellent organisation of the conference, which ensured that everything ran perfectly well. Overall, the event was an enriching experience that has further strengthened my interest.  
 Marcel Dix  
 Scientist Industrial AI, ABB AG Corporate Research Center Germany  
 A significant number of contributions at this year's INDIN conference concerned the fascinating topic of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This clearly reflects the growing importance of AI at my company ABB as well, as the increasing digital transformation in our industries opens up diverse applications for AI.  
 Here, a challenge will be to make the predictions of AI models more explainable for industrial users, so that AI can genuinely provide valuable support to them. To address this issue, we were truly grateful for the opportunity to host a special session at the INDIN 2023 on the issue of Explainable AI (XAI) and interactive Machine Learning for industrial applications.  
 Our heartfelt appreciation goes to the conference chairs, organizers, and the many dedicated helpers who made this conference an outstanding success, featuring a highly engaging program, all made possible at the cutting-edge university campus of TH OWL in Lemgo.

 The 2023 IEEE INDIN conference in Lemgo exceeded all expectations with its exceptional organization and seamless execution. The event boasted an impressive lineup of distinguished speakers, delivering profound insights, alongside numerous high-quality scientific articles. The gala dinner was a standout, leaving a lasting impression on the attendees. Special recognition goes to the co-chairs, Prof. Lukasz Wisniewski and Prof. Juergen Jasperneite, and the entire local team in Lemgo for their outstanding efforts. Undoubtedly, this year’s conference ranks among the finest I’ve ever attended, and it was a privilege to be part of such remarkable gathering.  
 Jie Wang  
 Professor, Stanford University, California  
 INDIN 2023 at Lemgo is such a wonderful conference, and I am so happy to participate. Discussion of innovation driven industrial informatics, sustainable development of ecosystem such as OWL, and from Lemgo to the whole world: a global network of local innovative communities, is so impressive and forward-looking. Of course, the deep hospitality and well-organized activities are also very impressive!

 Abstract submission deadline: | 07/09/2023 | 11/09/2023 
  Full Paper submission deadline: | 07/09/2023 | 11/09/2023 
  Notification to authors: | 15/10/2023 | 17/10/2023 
  Final manuscripts due: | 25/10/2023 | 31/10/2023 
 Instructions for authors:    
 Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that any of the authors has published elsewhere or make use of any generative AI or has submitted in parallel to any journal or any other conference or workshop with formally published proceedings. Authors may also not submit the work to any other journal or conference/workshop with published proceedings until the date of notification. Accepted submissions may not appear in any other conference or workshop that has proceedings. Information about submissions may be shared with programme chairs of other conferences for the purpose of detecting duplication.  
 Submissions must be processed in LaTeX2e and must use the Springer LNCS format with default margins and font. Submissions must be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgements, or obvious references. Each submission must begin with a title, a short abstract, and a list of key words, followed by a main body, appendices (if any), and references. The main body should begin with an introduction that summarizes the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non-specialist reader. The length of the paper, including appendices (if any) and excluding references should not exceed 20 pages when formatted using the LNCS style  . If the authors include appendices, they should be placed after the main body and before the references.  
 Submissions not meeting these requirements risk rejection without consideration of their merits.    
 Optionally, additional supporting material can be appended to the submission. The additional supporting material should be placed after the references, it should be well-marked, and it has no prescribed form or page limit. Alternatively, the supporting material can be submitted as a separate file. Authors are encouraged to use this space to include proofs, source code, and other information allowing verification of results; unverifiable papers risk rejection. However, committee members will read the additional supporting material at their discretion, so the submission should be intelligible and self-contained without it.  
 The proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. The final versions of the accepted papers will have a page limit of 20 pages (including appendices (if any) and excluding references). Thus, the submitted paper should represent what the authors expect to finally publish. All accepted papers must conform to the Springer publishing requirements, and authors will be required to sign the Springer’s LNCS Copyright form when submitting the proceedings version of their paper. By submitting a paper, the authors agree that if the paper is accepted, one of the authors will present the paper at the conference.  
 Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format.   
  Procedure for submission:   [Easychair Link]    
  Conflict of Interest:    
 The authors of each submission are asked during the submission process to identify all members of the Program Committee who have an automatic conflict of interest (COI) with the submission. A reviewer and an author have an automatic COI if one was the thesis advisor/supervisor of the other, or if they’ve shared an institutional affiliation within the last two years, or if they’ve published two or more joint authored works within the last three years, or if they are in the same family. Any further COIs of importance should be separately disclosed. It is the responsibility of all authors to ensure correct reporting of COI information. Submissions with incorrect or incomplete COI information may be rejected without consideration of their merits.
