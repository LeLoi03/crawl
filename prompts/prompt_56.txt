 Important Dates  
 Paper submission: Oct 18, 2022 
  Notification of decision: Jan 10, 2023 
  Camera-ready versions due: Feb 13, 2023 
  Author presentations due: Mar 28, 2023 
  Conference: April 24–27, 2023 
  Call for Papers  
 Original papers on all technical aspects of cryptology are solicited for submission. Papers of interest to the wider audience of security professionals at RSA Conference are especially encouraged. Topics include but are not limited to:  
 Design and security analysis of cryptographic primitives and protocols 
  Novel applications of cryptography 
  Cryptanalysis 
  Side-channel attacks and defenses 
  We also welcome systematization of knowledge (SoK)  papers. These papers will not be judged on novel research contributions, but on their value to the research community. SoK papers should provide an important new viewpoint on an established, major research area; support or challenge long-held beliefs in such an area with compelling evidence; or present a convincing, comprehensive new taxonomy of such an area. Survey papers without such insights are not appropriate for acceptance.  
 For submissions including practical evaluations, it is encouraged (but not required) to make implementations available to facilitate replicability and reproducibility.  
 Accepted papers (including SoK papers) will appear in the CT-RSA proceedings, published by Springer in its LNCS series.  
 CT-RSA is scheduled to be an in-person event. One of the things that makes CT-RSA special is the interaction between academia and industry. For that reason, it is strongly  preferred that authors of accepted papers present their work in-person. Exceptions will be made only in the case of serious extenuating circumstances, such as COVID restrictions, visa delays, and other emergencies. The presenter of each paper will be given a free Full Pass to RSA Conference.

 Overview  
 Top Research Topics at The Cryptographers’ Track at the RSA Conference?  
  Theoretical computer science (30.12%) 
  The objective of the conference is to combine knowledge in the areas of Computer security, Cryptography, Theoretical computer science, Encryption and Algorithm. The Computer security study tackled is a key component of adjacent topics in the area of Protocol (object-oriented programming). It holds forums on Cryptography that merges themes from other disciplines such as Discrete mathematics, Digital signature and Public-key cryptography.  
 The main emphasis of the conference is the subject of Probabilistic encryption, focusing on Deterministic encryption. Ciphertext indistinguishability is part of Ciphertext studies tackled in it. The work on Block cipher addressed in it expands to the thematically related Cipher.  
 What are the most cited papers published at the conference?  
  Research areas of the most cited articles at The Cryptographers’ Track at the RSA Conference:  
 The conference articles mainly deal with areas of study such as Cryptography, Theoretical computer science, Computer security, Encryption and Public-key cryptography. The most cited articles explore research in Parallel computing and overlapping concepts in Modular exponentiation to expand the discourse in Cryptography. While Encryption is the key highlight in the most cited papers, thet also covered some subjects on Embedded system and Advanced Encryption Standard.  
 What topics the last edition of the conference is best known for?  
 Operating system 
  Programming language 
  The previous edition focused in particular on these issues:  
 The Cryptographers’ Track at the RSA Conference facilitates discussions on Cryptography, Discrete mathematics, Theoretical computer science, Computer security and Cryptanalysis. The presentations focused mostly on Cryptography in an attempt to further explore topics in Algorithm. In the event, Representation (mathematics), Key exchange, EdDSA, Scheme (programming language) and Function (mathematics) are investigated in conjunction with one another to address concerns in Theoretical computer science research.  
 The presented Computer security study covers related areas such as Computer security model, Anonymity and Blockchain and also touches on topics like First generation. The Cryptographers’ Track at the RSA Conference is concerned with the study of Cryptanalysis and Encryption in general. Public-key cryptography research are fields of study within Encryption but they also intertwine with concepts in Random function.  
 The most cited articles from the last conference are:  
 Inverse-Sybil Attacks in Automated Contact Tracing (3 citations) 
  Secure Fast Evaluation of Iterative Methods: With an Application to Secure PageRank (1 citations) 
  Papers citation over time  
 A key indicator for each conference is its effectiveness in reaching other researchers with the papers published at that venue.

 Publication chance based on affiliation  
 The publication chance index shows the ratio of articles published by the best research institutions at the conference edition to all articles published within that conference. The best research institutions were selected based on the largest number of articles published during all editions of the conference.  
 Returning Authors Index  
 A very common phenomenon observed among researchers publishing scientific articles is the intentional selection of conferences they have already attended in the past. In particular, it is worth analyzing the case when the authors participate in the same conference from year to year.  
 The Returning Authors Index presented below illustrates the ratio of authors who participated in both a given as well as the previous edition of the conference in relation to all participants in a given year.

 Returning Institution Index  
 The graph below shows the Returning Institution Index, illustrating the ratio of institutions that participated in both a given and the previous edition of the conference in relation to all affiliations present in a given year.

 The experience to innovation index  
 Our experience to innovation index was created to show a cross-section of the experience level of authors publishing at a conference. The index includes the authors publishing at the last edition of a conference  , grouped by total number of publications throughout their academic career (P) and the total number of citations of these publications ever received (C).  
 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups:  
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25),
