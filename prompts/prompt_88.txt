The length of the submission is limited to 5 pages of A4 (excluding references). The results presented in a submission should not have been published (on-line or in print) in a journal or in peer-reviewed conference proceedings in 2022 or earlier. The extended abstracts of accepted submissions will be published in the proceedings of EUROCOMB'23.  
 After the paper acceptance, the authors will be kindly asked to format the paper according to the followinig style ( LaTeX template  ).  
  Call for Papers  
  As the previous 11 conferences of the Eurocomb series, EUROCOMB'23 covers the full range of combinatorics and graph theory including applications in other areas of mathematics, computer science and engineering. The scope includes but is not limited to:  
 ● Algebraic combinatorics 
  ● Topological combinatorics 
 We expect to accept about the same number of submissions for oral presentation as in the recent years. Since the number of slots for oral presentations is limited, submissions of good quality that cannot be accepted for full presentation due to capacity constraints will be invited to be presented during the poster session.

    The 26th European Conference on Genetic Programming (EuroGP) 2023 conference will take place as part of EvoStar (Evo*).  
  EuroGP is the premier annual conference on Genetic Programming (GP), the oldest and the only meeting worldwide devoted specifically to this branch of evolutionary computation. It is always a high-quality, enjoyable, friendly event, attracting participants from all continents, and offering excellent opportunities for networking, informal contact, and exchange of ideas with fellow researchers. It will feature a mixture of oral presentations and poster sessions and invited keynote speakers. EuroGP is featured in the conference ranking database CORE  .  
 You can consult the proceedings of previous events at EuroGP Conference Proceedings in SpringerLink   
 A comprehensive bibliography of genetic programming literature and links to related material is accessible at the Genetic Programming Bibliography  web page, part of the Collection of Computer Science Bibliographies maintained and managed by William Langdon, Steven Gustafson, and John Koza.

 Welcome to EuroMPI'23  
 11-13 September 2023, Bristol, UK  
 In 2023, EuroMPI Conference will take place in Bristol on September 11-13, 2023. The conference will be co-located with the 19th International Workshop on OpenMP (IWOMP 2023)  that will be held on September 13-15,2023. The MPI Forum will also meet following the EuroMPI Conference.  
 Through the presentation of contributed papers, posters and invited talks, the conference presents a complete overview of MPI, its current usage in the parallel programming landscape, and its future directions. The EuroMPI conference provides ample opportunities for attendees to interact and share ideas and experiences to contribute to the improvement and furthering of message-passing and related parallel programming paradigms.

 Awards and Recognition  |  Mathematics and Computer Science  Researchers receive Best Paper Award at European MPI  users meeting  
 MCS Menu  
 By Gail Pieper   
  |  November 1, 2023    
 Hui Zhou, a principal software development specialist in the MCS  division at Argonne, was co-author of  ​ “  MPI  Application Binary Interface Standardization,” which received the Best Paper award at the EuroMPI  ​ ’  23 conference in September 2023.   
    MPI  , or the Message Passing Interface, is widely used for high-performance computing workloads. While it is standardized in terms of the C and Fortran programming languages, however, it is not implementation agnostic; and the increasing adoption of MPI  by applications written in languages other than C and Fortran has motivated the development of an application binary interface ( ABI  ).  
 The proposal presented in this award-winning paper represents recent efforts by the MPI  Forum’s ABI  working group to develop a standard ABI  for MPI  that effectively addresses this issue.  
 “  We successfully tested our prototype implementation both within MPICH  and as an independent abstraction layer,” Zhou said.  
 The researchers acknowledge that realizing the full potential of a standard ABI  will likely take some time. The ABI  must be standardized by the MPI  Forum and implemented by the major implementations such as MPICH  ; and MPI  users will have to recompile everything against the MPI  ABI  .  
 Nevertheless, Zhou and his colleagues say that they are confident that ultimately having a standard MPI  ABI  will  ​ “  significantly reduce the pain of using MPI  in a variety of contexts and will encourage greater use of MPI  in new domains.”  
 For the full paper, see J. Hammond, L. D, Dalcin, Erik Schnetter, M. PéRache, J.-B. Besnard, J. Brown, G. B. Gadeschi, S. Byrne, J. Schuchart, and H. Zhou,  ​ “  MPI  Application Binary Interface Standardization  ,” in EuroMPI  ​ ’  23: Proceedings of the 30 th  European MPI  Users’ Group Meeting, September 2023, Article No.: 1, Pages 1–12.
