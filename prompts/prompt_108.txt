   Probing Taxonomic and Thematic Embeddings for Taxonomic Information    
  Filip Klubička  | John Kelleher    
 Modelling taxonomic and thematic relatedness is important for building AI with comprehensive natural language understanding. The goal of this paper is to learn more about how taxonomic information is structurally encoded in embeddings. To do this, we design a new hypernym-hyponym probing task and perform a comparative probing study of taxonomic and thematic SGNS and GloVe embeddings. Our experiments indicate that both types of embeddings encode some taxonomic information, but the amount, as well as the geometric properties of the encodings, are independently related to both the encoder architecture, as well as the embedding training data. Specifically, we find that only taxonomic embeddings carry taxonomic information in their norm, which is determined by the underlying distribution in the data.

   A W  ord N  et View on Crosslingual Transformers    
  Wondimagegnhue Tufa  | Lisa Beinborn  | Piek Vossen    
 WordNet is a database that represents relations between words and concepts as an abstraction of the contexts in which words are used. Contextualized language models represent words in contexts but leave the underlying concepts implicit. In this paper, we investigate how different layers of a pre-trained language model shape the abstract lexical relationship toward the actual contextual concept. Can we define the amount of contextualized concept forming needed given the abstracted representation of a word? Specifically, we consider samples of words with different polysemy profiles shared across three languages, assuming that words with a different polysemy profile require a different degree of concept shaping by context. We conduct probing experiments to investigate the impact of prior polysemy profiles on the representation in different layers. We analyze how contextualized models can approximate meaning through context and examine crosslingual interference effects.

   Towards Effective Correction Methods Using W  ord N  et Meronymy Relations    
  Javier Álvez  | Itziar Gonzalez-Dios  | German Rigau    
 In this paper, we analyse and compare several correction methods of knowledge resources with the purpose of improving the abilities of systems that require commonsense reasoning with the least possible human-effort. To this end, we cross-check the WordNet meronymy relation member against the knowledge encoded in a SUMO-based first-order logic ontology on the basis of the mapping between WordNet and SUMO. In particular, we focus on the knowledge in WordNet regarding the taxonomy of animals and plants. Despite being created manually, these knowledge resources — WordNet, SUMO and their mapping — are not free of errors and discrepancies. Thus, we propose three correction methods by semi-automatically improving the alignment between WordNet and SUMO, by performing some few corrections in SUMO and by combining the above two strategies. The evaluation of each method includes the required human-effort and the achieved improvement on unseen data from the WebChild project, that is tested using first-order logic automated theorem provers.

   On the Acquisition of W  ord N  et Relations in P  ortuguese from Pretrained Masked Language Models    
  Hugo Gonçalo Oliveira    
 This paper studies the application of pretrained BERT in the acquisition of synonyms, antonyms, hypernyms and hyponyms in Portuguese. Masked patterns indicating those relations were compiled with the help of a service for validating semantic relations, and then used for prompting three pretrained BERT models, one multilingual and two for Portuguese (base and large). Predictions for the masks were evaluated in two different test sets. Results achieved by the monolingual models are interesting enough for considering these models as a source for enriching wordnets, especially when predicting hypernyms of nouns. Previously reported performances on prediction were improved with new patterns and with the large model. When it comes to selecting the related word from a set of four options, performance is even better, but not enough for outperforming the selection of the most similar word, as computed with static word embeddings.

   Some Considerations in the Construction of a Historical Language W  ord N  et    
  Fahad Khan  | John P. McCrae  | Francisco Javier Minaya Gómez  | Rafael Cruz González  | Javier E. Díaz-Vera    
 This article describes the manual construction of a part of the Old English WordNet (Old-EWN) covering the semantic field of emotion terms. This manually constructed part of the wordnet is to be eventually integrated with the automatically generated/manually checked part covering the whole of the rest of the Old English lexicon (currently under construction). We present the workflow for the definition of these emotion synsets on the basis of a dataset produced by a specialist in this area. We also look at the enrichment of the original Global WordNet Association Lexical Markup Framework (GWA LMF) schema to include the extra information which this part of the OldEWN requires. In the final part of the article we discuss how the wordnet style of lexicon organisation can be used to share and disseminate research findings/datasets in lexical semantics.

   The R  omanian W  ordnet in Linked Open Data Format    
  Elena Irimia  | Verginica Mititelu    
 In this paper we present the standardization of the Romanian Wordnet by means of conversion to the Linked Open Data format. We describe the vocabularies used to encode data and metadata of this resource. The decisions made are in accordance with the characteristics of the Romanian Wordnet, which are the outcome of the development method, enrichment strategies and resources used for its creations. By interlinking with other resources, words in the Romanian Wordnet have now the pronunciation associated, as well as syntagmatic information, in the form of contexts of occurrences.

   Combining W  ord N  ets with Treebanks to study idiomatic language: A pilot study on Rigvedic formulas through the lenses of the S  anskrit W  ord N  et and the V  edic Treebank    
  Luca Brigada Villa  | Erica Biagetti  | Riccardo Ginevra  | Chiara Zanchi    
 This paper shows how WordNets can be employed in tandem with morpho-syntactically annotated corpora to study poetic formulas. Pairing the lexico-semantic information of the Sanskrit WordNet with morpho-syntactic annotation from the Vedic Treebank, we perform a pilot study of formulas including SPEECH verbs in the RigVeda, the most ancient text of the. Sanskrit literature.

   Word Sense Disambiguation Based on Iterative Activation Spreading with Contextual Embeddings for Sense Matching    
  Arkadiusz Janz  | Maciej Piasecki    
 Many knowledge-based solutions were proposed to solve Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) problem with limited annotated resources. Such WSD algorithms are able to cover very large sense repositories, but still being outperformed by supervised ones on benchmark data. In this paper, we start with analysis identifying key properties and issues in application of spreading activation algorithms in knowledge-based WSD, e.g. influence of the network local structures, interaction with context information and sense frequency. Taking our observations as a point of departure, we introduce a novel solution with new context-to-sense matching using BERT embeddings, iterative parallel spreading activation function and selective sense alignment using contextual BERT embeddings. The proposed solution obtains performance beyond the state-of-the-art for the contemporary knowledge-based WSD approaches for both English and Polish data.

   Mapping G  erma N  et for the Semantic Web using O  nto L  ex-Lemon    
  Claus Zinn  | Marie Hinrichs  | Erhard Hinrichs    
 GermaNet is a large lexical-semantic net that relates German nouns, verbs, and adjectives semantically. The word net has been manually constructed over the last 25 years and hence presents a high-quality, valuable resource for German. While GermaNet is maintained in a Postgres database, all its content can be exported as an XML-based serialisation. Recently, this XML representation has been converted into RDF, largely by staying close to GermaNet’s principle of arrangement where lexunits that share the same meaning are grouped together into so-called synsets. With each lexical unit and synset now globally addressable via a unique resource identifier, it has become much easier to link together GermaNet entries with other lexical and semantic resources. In terms of semantic interoperability, however, the RDF variant of GermaNet leaves much to be desired. In this paper, we describe yet another conversion from GermaNet’s XML representation to RDF. The new conversion makes use of the OntoLex-Lemon ontology, and therefore, presents a decisive step toward a GermaNet representation with a much higher level of semantic interoperability, and which makes it possible to use GermaNet with other wordnets that already support this conceptualisation of lexica.

   Initial Experiments for Building a G  uarani W  ord N  et    
  Luis Chiruzzo  | Marvin Agüero-Torales  | Aldo Alvarez  | Yliana Rodríguez    
 This paper presents a work in progress about creating a Guarani version of the WordNet database. Guarani is an indigenous South American language and is a low-resource language from the NLP perspective. Following the expand approach, we aim to find Guarani lemmas that correspond to the concepts defined in WordNet. We do this through three strategies that try to select the correct lemmas from Guarani-Spanish datasets. We ran them through three different bilingual dictionaries and had native speakers assess the results. This procedure found Guarani lemmas for about 6.5 thousand synsets, including 27% of the base WordNet concepts. However, more work on the quality of the selected words will be needed in order to create a final version of the dataset.

   A CCG  bank for T  urkish: From Dependency to CCG     
  Aslı Kuzgun  | Oğuz Kerem Yıldız  | Olcay Taner Yildiz    
 In this paper, we present the building of a CCGbank for Turkish by using standardised dependency corpora. We automatically induce Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) categories for each word token in the Turkish dependency corpora. The CCG induction algorithm we present here is based on the dependency relations that are defined in the latest release of the Universal Dependencies (UD) framework. We aim for an algorithm that can easily be used in all the Turkish treebanks that are annotated in this framework. Therefore, we employ a lexicalist approach in order to make full use of the dependency relations while creating a semantically transparent corpus. We present the treebanks we employed in this study as well as their annotation framework. We introduce the structure of the algorithm we used along with the specific issues that are different from previous studies. Lastly, we show how the results change with this lexical approach in CCGbank for Turkish compared to the previous CCGbank studies in Turkish.

   Reusing the D  anish W  ord N  et for a New Central Word Register for D  anish - a Project Report    
  Bolette Pedersen  | Sanni Nimb  | Nathalie Sørensen  | Sussi Olsen  | Ida Flörke  | Thomas Troelsgård    
 In this paper we report on a new Danish lexical initiative, the Central Word Register for Danish, (COR), which aims at providing an open-source, well curated and large-coverage lexicon for AI purposes. The semantic part of the lexicon (COR-S) relies to a large extent on the lexical-semantic information provided in the Danish wordnet, DanNet. However, we have taken the opportunity to evaluate and curate the wordnet information while compiling the new resource. Some information types have been simplified and more systematically curated. This is the case for the hyponymy relations, the ontological typing, and the sense inventory, i.e. the treatment of polysemy, including systematic polysemy.

   Recent Developments in BTB  - W  ord N  et    
  Kiril Simov  | Petya Osenova    
 The paper reports on recent developments in Bulgarian BTB-WordNet (BTB-WN). This resource is viewed as playing a central role with respect to the integration and interlinking of various language resources such as: e-dictionaries (morphological, terminological, bilingual, orthographic, etymological and explanatory, etc., including editions from previous periods); corpora (coming from outside or being internal - like the corpus of definitions as well as the corpus of examples to synset meanings); ontologies (such as CIDOC-CRM, DBpedia, etc.); sources of world knowledge (such as information from the Bulgarian Encyclopedia, Wikipedia, etc.). The paper also gives information about a number of applications built on BTB-WN. These are: the Bulgaria-centered knowledge graph, the All about word application as well as some education-oriented exercises.

   Towards an RDF  Representation of the Infrastructure consisting in using Wordnets as a conceptual Interlingua between multilingual Sign Language Datasets    
  Thierry Declerck  | Thomas Troelsgård  | Sussi Olsen    
 We present ongoing work dealing with a Linked Data compliant representation of infrastructures using wordnets for connecting multilingual Sign Language data sets. We build for this on already existing RDF and OntoLex representations of Open Multilingual Wordnet (OMW) data sets and work done by the European EASIER research project on the use of the CSV files of OMW for linking glosses and basic semantic information associated with Sign Language data sets in two languages: German and Greek. In this context, we started the transformation into RDF of a Danish data set, which links Danish Sign Language data and the wordnet for Danish, DanNet. The final objective of our work is to include Sign Language data sets (and their conceptual cross-linking via wordnets) in the Linguistic Linked Open Data cloud.

   Expanding the Conceptual Description of Verbs in W  ord N  et with Semantic and Syntactic Information    
  Ivelina Stoyanova  | Svetlozara Leseva    
 This paper describes an ongoing effort towards expanding the semantic and conceptual description of verbs in WordNet by combining information from two other resources, FrameNet and VerbNet, as well as enriching the verbs’ description with syntactic patterns extracted from the three resources. The conceptual description of verb synsets is provided by assigning a FrameNet frame which provides the relevant set of frame elements denoting the predicate’s participants and props. This information is supplemented by assigning a VerbNet class and the set of semantic roles associated with it. The information extracted from FrameNet and VerbNet and assigned to a synset is aligned (semi-automatically with subsequent manual corrections) at the following levels: (i) FrameNet frame: VerbNet class; (ii) FrameNet frame elements: VerbNet semantic roles; (iii) FrameNet semantic types and restrictions: VerbNet selectional restrictions. We then link the syntactic patterns associated with the units in FrameNet, VerbNet and WordNet, by unifying their representation and by matching the corresponding patterns at the level of syntactic groups. The alignment of the semantic components and their syntactic realisations is essential for the better exploitation of the abundance of information across resources, including shedding light on cross-resource similarities, discrepancies and inconsistencies. The syntactic patterns can facilitate the extraction of examples illustrating the use of verb synset literals in corpora and their semantic characterisation through the association of the syntactic groups with the components of semantic description (frame elements or semantic roles) and can be employed in various tasks requiring semantic and syntactic description. The resource is publicly available to the community. The components of the conceptual description are visualised showing the links to the original resources each component is drawn from.

   An Experiment: Finding Parents for Parentless Synsets by Means of CILI     
  Ahti Lohk  | Martin Rebane  | Heili Orav    
 Identifying and correcting inconsistencies in wordnets is a natural part of their development. Focusing only on the subproblem of missing links, we aim to find automatically possible parents for parentless synsets in IS-A hierarchies of a target wordnet by means of source wordnets where target and source wordnets are in XML-format and equipped with Collaborative Interlingual Index (CILI). In this paper, we describe the algorithm and provide statistics on the possible parents of parentless synsets of the wordnets included in the study. Additionally, we investigate the suitability of the proposed potential parent synsets for correcting noun and verb synsets within the Estonian wordnet.

   Extending the usage of adjectives in the Z  ulu A  f WN     
  Laurette Marais  | Laurette Pretorius    
 The African languages Wordnet (AfWN) for Zulu (ZWN) was built using the expand approach, which relies on the translation of concepts in the Princeton WordNet (PWN), while retaining their PWN lexical categories. In this paper the focus is on the adjective as PWN lexical category. What is considered adjectival information (provided both attributively and predicatively) in English, is usually verbalised quite differently in Zulu - often as verb or copulative constructions - as may be seen by inspecting the Zulu written forms in “adjective” entries in ZWN. These written forms are not complete Zulu verb or copulative constructions and in order for them to be useful, tense, polarity and agreement have to be added. This paper presents a grammar-based approach to recover important morphosyntactic information implicit in the ZWN “adjective” written forms in order to derive a tool that would assist a user of the ZWN to render and analyse correct full forms automatically as desired by the context in which an “adjective” is used.

   Linking SIL  Semantic Domains to W  ordnet and Expanding the A  bui W  ordnet through Rapid Word Collection Methodology    
  Luis Morgado Da Costa  | František Kratochvíl  | George Saad  | Benidiktus Delpada  | Daniel Simon Lanma  | Francis Bond  | Natálie Wolfová  | A.l. Blake    
 In this paper we describe a new methodology to expand the Abui Wordnet through data collected using the Rapid Word Collection (RWC) method – based on SIL’s Semantic Domains. Using a multilingual sense-intersection algorithm, we created a ranked list of concept suggestions for each domain, and then used the ranked list as a filter to link the Abui RWC data to wordnet. This used translations from both SIL’s Semantic Domain’s structure and example words, both available through SIL’s Fieldworks software and the RWC project. We release both the new mapping of the SIL Semantic Domains to wordnet and an expansion of the Abui Wordnet.

   What do Language Models know about word senses? Zero-Shot WSD  with Language Models and Domain Inventories    
  Oscar Sainz  | Oier Lopez de Lacalle  | Eneko Agirre  | German Rigau    
 Language Models are the core for almost any Natural Language Processing system nowadays. One of their particularities is their contextualized representations, a game changer feature when a disambiguation between word senses is necessary. In this paper we aim to explore to what extent language models are capable of discerning among senses at inference time. We performed this analysis by prompting commonly used Languages Models such as BERT or RoBERTa to perform the task of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). We leverage the relation between word senses and domains, and cast WSD as a textual entailment problem, where the different hypothesis refer to the domains of the word senses. Our results show that this approach is indeed effective, close to supervised systems.

   Towards the integration of W  ord N  et into C  lin IDM  ap    
  Elena Zotova  | Montse Cuadros  | German Rigau    
 This paper presents the integration of WordNet knowledge resource into ClinIDMap tool, which aims to map identifiers between clinical ontologies and lexical resources. ClinIDMap interlinks identifiers from UMLS, SMOMED-CT, ICD-10 and the corresponding Wikidata and Wikipedia articles for concepts from the UMLS Metathesaurus. The main goal of the tool is to provide semantic interoperability across the clinical concepts from various knowledge bases. As a side effect, the mapping enriches already annotated medical corpora in multiple languages with new labels. In this new release, we add WordNet 3.0 and 3.1 synsets using the available mappings through Wikidata. Thanks to cross-lingual links in MCR we also include the corresponding synsets in other languages and also, extend further ClinIDMap with different domain information. Finally, the final resource helps in the task of enriching of already annotated clinical corpora with additional semantic annotations.

   Connecting Multilingual Wordnets: Strategies for Improving ILI  Classification in O  de N  et    
  Melanie Siegel  | Johann Bergh    
 The Open Multilingual Wordnet (OMW) is an open source project that was launched with the goal to make it easy to use wordnets in multiple languages without having to pay expensive proprietary licensing costs. As OMW evolved, the interlingual indicator (ILI)1 was used to allow semantically equivalent synsets in different languages to be linked to each other. OdeNet2 is the German language wordnet which forms part of the OMW project. This paper analyses the shortcomings of the initial ILI classification in OdeNet and the consequent methods used to improve this classification.

  Introduction  
 The 18th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems (HAIS 2023) combines symbolic and sub-symbolic techniques to construct more robust and reliable problem solving models. Hybrid intelligent systems are popular due to their capabilities in handling many real world complex problems, involving imprecision, uncertainty and vagueness, high-dimensionality. They provide us with the opportunity to use both, our knowledge and row data to solve problems in a more interesting and promising way.  
 HAIS Series of Conferences provides an interesting opportunity to present and discuss the latest theoretical advances and real-world applications in this multidisciplinary research field.

 Welcome to HAI ’23!   
 The Eleventh International Conference on Human-Agent Interaction (HAI 2023) aims to be the premier interdisciplinary venue for discussing and disseminating state-of-the-art research and results that have implications across conventional interaction boundaries including robots, software agents and digitally-mediated human-human communication. HAI will gather researchers from fields spanning engineering, computer science, psychology and sociology, and will cover diverse topics, including: human-robot interaction, affective computing, computer-supported collaborative work, gaming and serious games, artificial intelligence, and more.  
 The theme for the HAI2023 conference will be “Human Empowerment and Inclusive Society”  . The development of HAI and AI tools in virtual and real contexts has enriched the metaverse and opened up new possibilities in social tasks and for human beings themselves. This has raised questions on the trustworthiness and fairness of these systems. Further, how we can make these systems more equitable and inclusive in their design as they interact with humans. Consequently, the next step we need to take is to carry out in expanding an inclusive society as one of sustainable development goals. It is still unclear how people can live happily amidst the amazing development of technology. While all submissions related to HAI are welcome, you are especially encouraged to submit papers in line with the theme for HAI 2023.
