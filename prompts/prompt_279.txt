2. VECoS_0 conference:
16th International Conference on Verification and Evaluation of Computer and Communication Systems  
 18-20 October 2023, Marrakech, Morocco  
 Background  
 VECoS 2023 is planned as a physical, in-person event to be held October 18-20, 2023 in Marrakech, Morocco. VECoS 2023 will take place at the Faculty of Science and Technology Gueliz  , Cadi Ayyad University  , Marrakech  
  However, in a limited number of cases, there will be remote participation support for speakers and other participants who cannot come for a number of reasons.  
 Scope  
 The VECoS conference series focuses on the analysis of computer and communication systems, where functional and extra-functional properties are inter-related. VECoS encourages the cross-fertilization between the various formal verification and evaluation approaches, methods and techniques, especially those developed for concurrent and distributed hardware/software systems.  
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Abstraction techniques 
  Application domains  
 adaptive systems, cloud computing, communication protocols, computer graphics, computer vision, computer-supported collaborative work systems, cyber-physical systems, cybersecurity, high-performance computing, image processing, intelligent software, internet of things, learning-enabled systems, logistics systems, manufacturing of the future, mobile and wireless networking, operations research, programming languages, real-time and embedded operating systems, service-oriented systems, telecommunication systems, ubiquitous systems, web services, wireless sensor networks and workflow systems.  
 Paper Submission  
 Contributions must have not been published previously, nor already submitted to other conferences/journals. Manuscripts must be submitted in PDF format electronically, via the EasyChair  system using the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)  format and should not exceed 15 pages, including the reference list. The proceedings of the conference will be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science  series. Accepted papers will appear in the conference proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the conference and present the paper. Selected papers from the Conference will be considered for publication in extended and revised form in a special issue of an indexed international journal (ISSE,  IJCCBS  or Arima  ).   
 Authors of accepted papers must submit a signed Consent to Publish form, through which the copyright of their paper is transferred to Springer. Please download the template of the form here: VECoS Copyright form.

 Verification and Evaluation  
  of Computer and Communication Systems  
  The International Conference on Verification and Evaluation of Computer and Communication Systems (VECoS) was created by an Euro-Med network of researchers in computer science. The aim of the VECoS conference is to bring together researchers and practitioners, in the areas of verification, control, performance, quality of service, dependability evaluation and assessment, in order to discuss the state-of-the-art and the challenges in modern computer and communication systems in which functional and non-functional properties are strongly interrelated. Thus, the main motivation for VECoS is to encourage the cross-fertilization between the various formal verification and evaluation approaches, methods and techniques, and especially those based on the specification formalisms for concurrent, distributed and software/hardware systems. Beyond its technical and scientific goals, another main purpose of VECoS is to promote collaboration between participants in research and education in the area of computer science and engineering.

8. VEE_2 conference:
Virtual Execution Environments (VEE)  
 The goal of Virtual Execution Environments is to be a first-rate research forum that brings together leading practitioners and researchers in the broad area of virtualization, which includes topics such as high-level language virtual machines (JVM, CLR etc.), process and system virtual machines, translators, machine emulators, and simulators.  
 VEE Steering Committee   
 The current VEE steering committee is:  
 Jennifer B. Sartor | (Ghent University and Vrije Universiteit Brussel) 
  Chris Rossbach | (UT Austin) 
 VEE Steering Committee Composition   
 The VEE steering committee (SC) comprises past general and program chairs and a USENIX representative, assuming USENIX continues to co-sponsor the event. After each instance of VEE, membership on the steering committee will be updated as follows:  
 Additions   
 The general and program chairs of the most recent VEE conference will be invited to join the SC, if they are not already members.  
 Deletions   
 When the conference has been held for a number of years, members will be removed from the committee based on the date of the last time they were general chair (GC) or program chair of VEE.  
 The GC in year X becomes the SC Chair in year X+2. In other words, the GC serves one year, participates in the SC the next year, and then chairs it the third year.

 VEHITS 2023 will be held in conjunction with GISTAM 2023    , CLOSER 2023    and SMARTGREENS 2023    .   
  Registration to VEHITS allows free access to the GISTAM, CLOSER and SMARTGREENS conferences (as a non-speaker).  
  Although the conference is back to the normal mode (i.e., in-person) speakers are allowed to present remotely if unable to travel to the venue (hybrid support).    
 The purpose of the International Conference on Vehicle Technology and Intelligent Transport Systems (VEHITS) is to bring together engineers, researchers and practitioners interested in the advances and applications in the field of Vehicle Technology and Intelligent Transport Systems.  
  This conference focuses on innovative applications, tools and platforms in all technology areas such as signal processing, wireless communications, informatics and electronics, related to different kinds of vehicles, including cars, off-road vehicles, trains, ships, underwater vehicles, or flying machines, and the intelligent transportation systems that connect and manage large numbers of vehicles, not only in the context of smart cities but in many other application domains.
