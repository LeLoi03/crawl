  Abstract    
 Graphs are fundamental tools for modelling relations among objects in various scientific fields. However, traditional static graphs have limitations when it comes to capturing the dynamic nature of real-world systems. To overcome this limitation, temporal graphs have been introduced as a framework to model graphs that change over time. In temporal graphs the edges among vertices appear and disappear at specific time steps, reflecting the temporal dynamics of the observed system, which allows us to analyse time dependent patterns and processes. In this paper we focus on the research related to sliding time windows in temporal graphs. Sliding time windows offer a way to analyse specific time intervals within the lifespan of a temporal graph. By sliding the window along the timeline, we can examine the graph’s characteristics and properties within different time periods. This paper provides an overview of the research on sliding time windows in temporal graphs. Although progress has been made in this field, there are still many interesting questions and challenges to be explored. We discuss some of the open problems and highlight their potential for future research.

  Abstract    
 We study the problem of finding a Hamiltonian cycle under the promise that the input graph has a minimum degree of at least n/2, where n denotes the number of vertices in the graph. The classical theorem of Dirac states that such graphs (a.k.a. Dirac graphs) are Hamiltonian, i.e., contain a Hamiltonian cycle. Moreover, finding a Hamiltonian cycle in Dirac graphs can be done in polynomial time in the classical centralized model. This paper presents a randomized distributed CONGEST algorithm that finds w.h.p. a Hamiltonian cycle (as well as maximum matching) within O(log n) rounds under the promise that the input graph is a Dirac graph. This upper bound is in contrast to general graphs in which both the decision and search variants of Hamiltonicity require Ω̃(n²) rounds, as shown by Bachrach et al. [PODC'19]. In addition, we consider two generalizations of Dirac graphs: Ore graphs and Rahman-Kaykobad graphs [IPL'05]. In Ore graphs, the sum of the degrees of every pair of non-adjacent vertices is at least n, and in Rahman-Kaykobad graphs, the sum of the degrees of every pair of non-adjacent vertices plus their distance is at least n+1. We show how our algorithm for Dirac graphs can be adapted to work for these more general families of graphs.

  Abstract    
 Semiring semantics of first-order logic generalises classical Boolean semantics by permitting truth values from a commutative semiring, which can model information such as costs or access restrictions. This raises the question to what extent classical model-theoretic properties still apply, and how this depends on the algebraic properties of the semiring. In this paper, we study this question for the classical locality theorems due to Hanf and Gaifman. We prove that Hanf’s locality theorem generalises to all semirings with idempotent operations, but fails for many non-idempotent semirings. We then consider Gaifman normal forms and show that for formulae with free variables, Gaifman’s theorem does not generalise beyond the Boolean semiring. Also for sentences, it fails in the natural semiring and the tropical semiring. Our main result, however, is a constructive proof of the existence of Gaifman normal forms for min-max and lattice semirings. The proof implies a stronger version of Gaifman’s classical theorem in Boolean semantics: every sentence has a Gaifman normal form which does not add negations.

  Abstract    
 A first-order formula is called primitive positive (pp) if it only admits the use of existential quantifiers and conjunction. Pp-formulas are a central concept in (fixed-template) constraint satisfaction since CSP(Γ) can be viewed as the problem of deciding the primitive positive theory of Γ, and pp-definability captures gadget reductions between CSPs. An important class of tractable constraint languages Γ is characterized by having few subpowers, that is, the number of n-ary relations pp-definable from Γ is bounded by 2^p(n) for some polynomial p(n). In this paper we study a restriction of this property, stating that every pp-definable relation is definable by a pp-formula of polynomial length. We conjecture that the existence of such short definitions is actually equivalent to Γ having few subpowers, and verify this conjecture for a large subclass that, in particular, includes all constraint languages on three-element domains. We furthermore discuss how our conjecture imposes an upper complexity bound of co-NP on the subpower membership problem of algebras with few subpowers.

  Abstract    
 Counting abilities in finite automata are traditionally provided by two orthogonal extensions: adding a single counter that can be tested for zeroness at any point, or adding ℤ-valued counters that are tested for equality only at the end of runs. In this paper, finite automata extended with both types of counters are introduced. They are called Parikh One-Counter Automata (POCA): the "Parikh" part referring to the evaluation of counters at the end of runs, and the "One-Counter" part to the single counter that can be tested during runs. Their expressiveness, in the deterministic and nondeterministic variants, is investigated; it is shown in particular that there are deterministic POCA languages that cannot be expressed without nondeterminism in the original models. The natural decision problems are also studied; strikingly, most of them are no harder than in the original models. A parametric version of nonemptiness is also considered.

  Abstract    
 For three decades binary decision diagrams, a data structure efficiently representing Boolean functions, have been widely used in many distinct contexts like model verification, machine learning, cryptography and also resolution of combinatorial problems. The most famous variant, called reduced ordered binary decision diagram (robdd for short), can be viewed as the result of a compaction procedure on the full decision tree. A useful property is that once an order over the Boolean variables is fixed, each Boolean function is represented by exactly one robdd. In this paper we aim at computing the {exact distribution of the Boolean functions in k variables according to the robdd size}, where the robdd size is equal to the number of decision nodes of the underlying directed acyclic graph (dag) structure. Recall the number of Boolean functions with k variables is equal to 2^{2^k}, which is of double exponential growth with respect to the number of variables. The maximal size of a robdd with k variables is M_k ≈ 2^k / k. Apart from the natural combinatorial explosion observed, another difficulty for computing the distribution according to size is to take into account dependencies within the dag structure of robdds. In this paper, we develop the first polynomial algorithm to derive the distribution of Boolean functions over k variables with respect to robdd size denoted by n. The algorithm computes the (enumerative) generating function of robdds with k variables up to size n. It performs O(k n⁴) arithmetical operations on integers and necessitates storing O((k+n) n²) integers with bit length O(nlog n). Our new approach relies on a decomposition of robdds layer by layer and on an inclusion-exclusion argument.

  Abstract    
 Continuity is a key principle of intuitionistic logic that is generally accepted by constructivists but is inconsistent with classical logic. Most commonly, continuity states that a function from the Baire space to numbers, only needs approximations of the points in the Baire space to compute. More recently, another formulation of the continuity principle was put forward. It states that for any function F from the Baire space to numbers, there exists a (dialogue) tree that contains the values of F at its leaves and such that the modulus of F at each point of the Baire space is given by the length of the corresponding branch in the tree. In this paper we provide the first internalization of this "inductive" continuity principle within a computational setting. Concretely, we present a class of intuitionistic theories that validate this formulation of continuity thanks to computations that construct such dialogue trees internally to the theories using effectful computations. We further demonstrate that this inductive continuity principle implies other forms of continuity principles.

  Abstract    
 The universality problem asks whether a given finite state automaton accepts all the input words. For quantitative models of automata, where input words are mapped to real values, this is naturally extended to ask whether all the words are mapped to values above (or below) a given threshold. This is known to be undecidable for commonly studied examples such as weighted automata over the positive rational (plus-times) or the integer tropical (min-plus) semirings, or equivalently cost register automata (CRAs) over these semirings. In this paper, we prove that when restricted to CRAs with only three registers, the universality problem is still undecidable, even with additional restrictions for the CRAs to be copyless linear with resets. In contrast, we show that, assuming the unary encoding of updates, the ∀-exact problem (does the CRA output zero on all the words?) for integer min-plus linear CRAs can be decided in polynomial time if the number of registers is constant. Without the restriction on the number of registers this problem is known to be PSPACE-complete.

  Abstract    
 The Hunters and Rabbit game is played on a graph G where the Hunter player shoots at k vertices in every round while the Rabbit player occupies an unknown vertex and, if it is not shot, must move to a neighbouring vertex after each round. The Rabbit player wins if it can ensure that its position is never shot. The Hunter player wins otherwise. The hunter number h(G) of a graph G is the minimum integer k such that the Hunter player has a winning strategy (i.e., allowing him to win whatever be the strategy of the Rabbit player). This game has been studied in several graph classes, in particular in bipartite graphs (grids, trees, hypercubes...), but the computational complexity of computing h(G) remains open in general graphs and even in more restricted graph classes such as trees. To progress further in this study, we propose a notion of monotonicity (a well-studied and useful property in classical pursuit-evasion games such as Graph Searching games) for the Hunters and Rabbit game imposing that, roughly, a vertex that has already been shot "must not host the rabbit anymore". This allows us to obtain new results in various graph classes. More precisely, let the monotone hunter number mh(G) of a graph G be the minimum integer k such that the Hunter player has a monotone winning strategy. We show that pw(G) ≤ mh(G) ≤ pw(G)+1 for any graph G with pathwidth pw(G), which implies that computing mh(G), or even approximating mh(G) up to an additive constant, is NP-hard. Then, we show that mh(G) can be computed in polynomial time in split graphs, interval graphs, cographs and trees. These results go through structural characterisations which allow us to relate the monotone hunter number with the pathwidth in some of these graph classes. In all cases, this allows us to specify the hunter number or to show that there may be an arbitrary gap between h and mh, i.e., that monotonicity does not help. In particular, we show that, for every k ≥ 3, there exists a tree T with h(T) = 2 and mh(T) = k. We conclude by proving that computing h (resp., mh) is FPT parameterised by the minimum size of a vertex cover.

  Abstract    
 Given a (connected) undirected graph G, a set X ⊆ V(G) and integers k and p, the Steiner Subgraph Extension problem asks whether there exists a set S ⊇ X of at most k vertices such that G[S] is a p-edge-connected subgraph. This problem is a natural generalization of the well-studied Steiner Tree problem (set p = 1 and X to be the terminals). In this paper, we initiate the study of Steiner Subgraph Extension from the perspective of parameterized complexity and give a fixed-parameter algorithm (i.e., FPT algorithm) parameterized by k and p on graphs of bounded degeneracy (removing the assumption of bounded degeneracy results in W-hardness). Besides being an independent advance on the parameterized complexity of network design problems, our result has natural applications. In particular, we use our result to obtain new single-exponential FPT algorithms for several vertex-deletion problems studied in the literature, where the goal is to delete a smallest set of vertices such that: (i) the resulting graph belongs to a specified hereditary graph class, and (ii) the deleted set of vertices induces a p-edge-connected subgraph of the input graph.

  Abstract    
 Graph connectivity is a fundamental combinatorial optimization problem that arises in many practical applications, where usually a spanning subgraph of a network is used for its operation. However, in the real world, links may fail unexpectedly deeming the networks non-operational, while checking whether a link is damaged is costly and possibly erroneous. After an event that has damaged an arbitrary subset of the edges, the network operator must find a spanning tree of the network using non-damaged edges by making as few checks as possible. Motivated by such questions, we study the problem of finding a spanning tree in a network, when we only have access to noisy queries of the form "Does edge e exist?". We design efficient algorithms, even when edges fail adversarially, for all possible error regimes; 2-sided error (where any answer might be erroneous), false positives (where "no" answers are always correct) and false negatives (where "yes" answers are always correct). In the first two regimes we provide efficient algorithms and give matching lower bounds for general graphs. In the False Negative case we design efficient algorithms for large interesting families of graphs (e.g. bounded treewidth, sparse). Using the previous results, we provide tight algorithms for the practically useful family of planar graphs in all error regimes.

  Abstract    
 The minimum branch vertices spanning tree problem consists in finding a spanning tree T of an input graph G having the minimum number of branch vertices, that is, vertices of degree at least three in T. This NP-hard problem has been widely studied in the literature and has many important applications in network design and optimization. Algorithmic and combinatorial aspects of the problem have been extensively studied and its fixed parameter tractability has been recently considered. In this paper we focus on modular-width and show that the problem of finding a spanning tree with the minimum number of branch vertices is FPT with respect to this parameter.

  Abstract    
 In this paper, we consider the k-Covering Canadian Traveller Problem (k-CCTP), which can be seen as a variant of the Travelling Salesperson Problem. The goal of k-CCTP is finding the shortest tour for a traveller to visit a set of locations in a given graph and return to the origin. Crucially, unknown to the traveller, up to k edges of the graph are blocked and the traveller only discovers blocked edges online at one of their respective endpoints. The currently best known upper bound for k-CCTP is O(√k) which was shown in [Huang and Liao, ISAAC '12]. We improve this polynomial bound to a logarithmic one by presenting a deterministic O(log k)-competitive algorithm that runs in polynomial time. Further, we demonstrate the tightness of our analysis by giving a lower bound instance for our algorithm.

  Abstract    
 We initiate a study of the complexity of MSM-Median, the problem of computing a median of a set of k real-valued time series under the move-split-merge distance. This distance measure is based on three operations: moves, which may shift a data point in a time series; splits, which replace one data point in a time series by two consecutive data points of the same value; and merges, which replace two consecutive data points of equal value by a single data point of the same value. The cost of a move operation is the difference of the data point value before and after the operation, the cost of split and merge operations is defined via a given constant c. Our main results are as follows. First, we show that MSM-Median is NP-hard and W[1]-hard with respect to k for time series with at most three distinct values. Under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) our reduction implies that a previous dynamic programming algorithm with running time |I|^𝒪(k) [Holznigenkemper et al., Data Min. Knowl. Discov. '23] is essentially optimal. Here, |I| denotes the total input size. Second, we show that MSM-Median can be solved in 2^𝒪(d/c)⋅|I|^𝒪(1) time where d is the total distance of the median to the input time series.

  Abstract    
 Finding a maximum cardinality common independent set in two matroids (also known as Matroid Intersection) is a classical combinatorial optimization problem, which generalizes several well-known problems, such as finding a maximum bipartite matching, a maximum colorful forest, and an arborescence in directed graphs. Enumerating all maximal common independent sets in two (or more) matroids is a classical enumeration problem. In this paper, we address an "intersection" of these problems: Given two matroids and a threshold τ, the goal is to enumerate all maximal common independent sets in the matroids with cardinality at least τ. We show that this problem can be solved in polynomial delay and polynomial space. We also discuss how to enumerate all maximal common independent sets of two matroids in non-increasing order of their cardinalities.

  Abstract    
 Choiceless Polynomial Time (CPT) is one of the few remaining candidate logics for capturing Ptime. In this paper, we make progress towards separating CPT from polynomial time by firstly establishing a connection between the expressive power of CPT and the existence of certain symmetric circuit families, and secondly, proving lower bounds against these circuits. We focus on the isomorphism problem of unordered Cai-Fürer-Immerman-graphs (the CFI-query) as a potential candidate for separating CPT from Ptime. Results by Dawar, Richerby and Rossman, and subsequently by Pakusa, Schalthöfer and Selman show that the CFI-query is CPT-definable on linearly ordered and preordered base graphs with small colour classes. We define a class of CPT-algorithms, that we call "CFI-symmetric algorithms", which generalises all the known ones, and show that such algorithms can only define the CFI-query on a given class of base graphs if there exists a family of symmetric XOR-circuits with certain properties. These properties include that the circuits have the same symmetries as the base graphs, are of polynomial size, and satisfy certain fan-in restrictions. Then we prove that such circuits with slightly strengthened requirements (i.e. stronger symmetry and fan-in and fan-out restrictions) do not exist for the n-dimensional hypercubes as base graphs. This almost separates the CFI-symmetric algorithms from Ptime - up to the gap that remains between the circuits whose existence we can currently disprove and the circuits whose existence is necessary for the definability of the CFI-query by a CFI-symmetric algorithm.

  Abstract    
 The notion of a real-valued function is central to mathematics, computer science, and many other scientific fields. Despite this importance, there are hardly any positive results on decision procedures for predicate logical theories that reason about real-valued functions. This paper defines a first-order predicate language for reasoning about multi-dimensional smooth real-valued functions and their derivatives, and demonstrates that - despite the obvious undecidability barriers - certain positive decidability results for such a language are indeed possible.

  Abstract    
 Previous work on Dynamic Complexity has established that there exist dynamic constant-time parallel algorithms for regular tree languages and context-free languages under label or symbol changes. However, these algorithms were not developed with the goal to minimise work (or, equivalently, the number of processors). In fact, their inspection yields the work bounds 𝒪(n²) and 𝒪(n⁷) per change operation, respectively. In this paper, dynamic algorithms for regular tree languages are proposed that generalise the previous algorithms in that they allow unbounded node rank and leaf insertions, while improving the work bound from 𝒪(n²) to 𝒪(n^ε), for arbitrary ε > 0. For context-free languages, algorithms with better work bounds (compared with 𝒪(n⁷)) for restricted classes are proposed: for every ε > 0 there are such algorithms for deterministic context-free languages with work bound 𝒪(n^{3+ε}) and for visibly pushdown languages with work bound 𝒪(n^{2+ε}).

  Abstract    
 Two graphs G and H are homomorphism indistinguishable over a class of graphs ℱ if for all graphs F ∈ ℱ the number of homomorphisms from F to G is equal to the number of homomorphisms from F to H. Many natural equivalence relations comparing graphs such as (quantum) isomorphism, spectral, and logical equivalences can be characterised as homomorphism indistinguishability relations over certain graph classes. Abstracting from the wealth of such instances, we show in this paper that equivalences w.r.t. any self-complementarity logic admitting a characterisation as homomorphism indistinguishability relation can be characterised by homomorphism indistinguishability over a minor-closed graph class. Self-complementarity is a mild property satisfied by most well-studied logics. This result follows from a correspondence between closure properties of a graph class and preservation properties of its homomorphism indistinguishability relation. Furthermore, we classify all graph classes which are in a sense finite (essentially profinite) and satisfy the maximality condition of being homomorphism distinguishing closed, i.e. adding any graph to the class strictly refines its homomorphism indistinguishability relation. Thereby, we answer various questions raised by Roberson (2022) on general properties of the homomorphism distinguishing closure.

  Abstract    
 The paper completely characterizes the primality of acyclic DFAs, where a DFA 𝒜 is prime if there do not exist DFAs 𝒜_1,… ,𝒜_t with ℒ(𝒜) = ⋂_{i=1}^t ℒ(𝒜_i) such that each 𝒜_i has strictly less states than the minimal DFA recognizing the same language as 𝒜. A regular language is prime if its minimal DFA is prime. Thus, this result also characterizes the primality of finite languages. Further, the NL-completeness of the corresponding decision problem Prime-DFA_fin is proven. The paper also characterizes the primality of acyclic DFAs under two different notions of compositionality, union and union-intersection compositionality. Additionally, the paper introduces the notion of S-primality, where a DFA 𝒜 is S-prime if there do not exist DFAs 𝒜₁,… ,𝒜_t with ℒ(𝒜) = ⋂_{i=1}^t ℒ(𝒜_i) such that each 𝒜_i has strictly less states than 𝒜 itself. It is proven that the problem of deciding S-primality for a given DFA is NL-hard. To do so, the NL-completeness of 2Minimal-DFA, the basic problem of deciding minimality for a DFA with at most two letters, is proven.

  Abstract    
 In this paper, we investigate computational power of threshold circuits and other theoretical models of neural networks in terms of the following four complexity measures: size (the number of gates), depth, weight and energy. Here, the energy of a circuit measures sparsity of their computation, and is defined as the maximum number of gates outputting non-zero values taken over all the input assignments. As our main result, we prove that any threshold circuit C of size s, depth d, energy e and weight w satisfies log(rk(M_C)) ≤ ed (log s + log w + log n), where rk(M_C) is the rank of the communication matrix M_C of a 2n-variable Boolean function that C computes. Thus, such a threshold circuit C is able to compute only a Boolean function of which communication matrix has rank bounded by a product of logarithmic factors of s, w and linear factors of d, e. This implies an exponential lower bound on the size of even sublinear-depth and sublinear-energy threshold circuit. For example, we can obtain an exponential lower bound s = 2^Ω(n^{1/3}) for threshold circuits of depth n^{1/3}, energy n^{1/3} and weight 2^o(n^{1/3}). We also show that the inequality is tight up to a constant factor when the depth d and energy e satisfies ed = o(n/log n). For other models of neural networks such as a discretized ReLU circuits and descretized sigmoid circuits, we define energy as the maximum number of gates outputting non-zero values. We then prove that a similar inequality also holds for a discretized circuit C: rk(M_C) = O(ed(log s + log w + log n)³). Thus, if we consider the number gates outputting non-zero values as a measure for sparse activity of a neural network, our results suggest that larger depth linearly helps neural networks to acquire sparse activity.

  Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics  
  website   
 The Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics (MFPS) conference series focuses on the semantics of high-level programming languages and its logical and mathematical foundations. The MFPS series attracts logicians, mathematicians and theoretical computer scientists who meet to exchange ideas and discuss problems of mutual interest.  
  MFPS meetings typically feature several plenary talks by leading researchers, as well as special sessions. Each special session focuses on a particular topic, with a plenary lecture, followed by several shorter talks by other experts in the area. The overall goal is to enhance interactions with neighboring areas, by inviting colleagues from those areas to present talks about their research and how it interacts with the traditional focus areas of MFPS. The remainder of the program is devoted to contributed talks selected by the Program Committee from submissions received in response to the Call for Papers.
