  Topics of interest 
  Past editions 
 The next LOPSTR symposium, LOPSTR 2024  , will be held in Milan (Italy) in September 9-11, 2024.  
 Currently, the aim of the LOPSTR series is to stimulate and promote international research and collaboration on logic-based program development. LOPSTR is open to contributions in logic-based program development in any language paradigm.  
 LOPSTR has a reputation for being a lively, friendly forum for presenting and discussing work in progress.  
   LOPSTR is usually co-located with PPDP ( International ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming  ).  
 You can find here  the old LOPSTR website maintained by Kung-Kiu Lau  .  
 Topics of interest cover all aspects of logic-based program development, all stages of the software life cycle, and issues of both programming-in-the-small and programming-in-the-large, including, but not limited to:  
  applications, tools and industrial practice 
  Survey papers that present some aspects of the above topics from a new perspective, and application papers that describe experience with industrial applications are also welcome.

 Transforming Big-Step to Small-Step Semantics Using Interpreter Specialisation  
  Abstract   
 Natural semantics (big-step) and structural operational semantics (small-step) each have advantages, so it can be useful to produce both semantic forms for a language. Previous work has shown that big-step semantics can be transformed to small-step semantics. This is also the goal of our work, but our main contribution is to show that this can be done by specialisation of an interpreter that imposes a small-step execution on big-step transition rules. This is arguably more direct, transparent and flexible than previous methods. The paper contains two examples and further examples are available in an online repository.

 A Novel EGs-Based Framework for Systematic Propositional-Formula Simplification  
  Abstract   
 This paper presents a novel simplification calculus for propositional logic derived from Peirce’s Existential Graphs’ rules of inference and implication graphs. Our rules can be applied to arbitrary propositional logic formulae (not only in CNF), are equivalence-preserving, guarantee a monotonically decreasing number of clauses and literals, and maximise the preservation of structural problem information. Our techniques can also be seen as higher-level SAT preprocessing, and we show how one of our rules (TWSR) generalises and streamlines most of the known equivalence-preserving SAT preprocessing methods. We further show how this rule can be extended with a novel n-ary implication graph to capture all known equivalence-preserving preprocessing procedures. Finally, we discuss the complexity and implementation of our framework as a solver-agnostic algorithm to simplify Boolean satisfiability problems and arbitrary propositional formula.

 LREC 2022 HIGHLIGHT   
 Identify, Describe and Share your LRs!   
 As scientific work requires accurate citations of referenced work so as to allow the community to understand the whole context and also replicate the experiments conducted by other researchers, LREC 2022 endorses the need to uniquely identify LRs through the use of the International Standard Language Resource Number (ISLRN, www.islrn.org), a Persistent Unique Identifier to be assigned to each Language Resource. The assignment of ISLRNs to LRs cited in LREC papers will be offered at submission time.
