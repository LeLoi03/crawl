 Instructions for authors  
 Submissions are closed  . The use of artificial intelligence (AI)‚Äìgenerated text in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section of the paper. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Regular papers   
 Please follow the Final Submission Instructions  to submit our Camera-Ready paper.   
 Short papers and posters (will be included on the conference website but not IEEExplore)  
 Short papers may present preliminary findings from work in progress, and industry perspectives on issues relevant to CIBCB 2023. Short papers should present and discuss a clear and focused central idea, incorporate discussion of relevant research or context, and provide references, as necessary. Short papers must adhere to the IEEE conference template  and have a length of no more than two (2) pages. Papers must be in PDF and written in English. Short papers will be desk reviewed by the CIBCB 2023 organizational committee. Submission implies the willingness of at least one of the authors to register and present the paper at the conference. Short papers can be presented as a poster  or as a short talk  session (5 minutes).  
 Please note that TU/e students  can present a poster  during the poster session for a strongly discounted price  ( ‚Ç¨ 25  ). The discounted registration fee gives access to the welcome drink  but does not grant access to the rest of the conference.

 About CICM -----------  
 Digital and computational solutions are becoming the prevalent means for the generation, communication, processing, storage and curation of mathematical information.  
 CICM brings together the many separate communities that have developed theoretical and practical solutions for mathematical applications such as computation, deduction, knowledge management, and user interfaces. It offers a venue for discussing problems and solutions in each of these areas and their integration.  
 The scope of CICM concerns all topics relating to intelligent computer mathematics, in particular but not limited to  
 * theorem proving and computer algebra * mathematical knowledge management * digital mathematical libraries  
 Workshops affiliated to CICM 2023: ----------------------------------  
 * 31th OpenMath Workshop, organized by James Davenport and Michael Kohlhase, * 3rd Workshop on Natural Formal Mathematics (NatFoM 2023) organized by Peter Koepke, Adrian De Lon and Dennis Mueller (also an EuroProofNet workshop), * 14th Workshop on Mathematical User Interaction (MathUI 2023), organized by Abhishek Chugh and Andrea Kohlhase, * 6th Workshop on Formal Mathematics for Mathematicians (FMM 2023), organized by Karol Pak.  
 The EuroProofNet Workshop on Libraries of Formal Proofs and Natural Mathematical Language, organized by Angeliki Koutsoukou Argyraki and Claudio Sacerdoti Coen is co-located with CICM 2023.
