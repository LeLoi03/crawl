 SPI Manifesto 
 We believe that networking and creating research and business relationships is important to create a sustainable community for improvement and innovation. While the conference offers ideas, presentations, discussions, knowledge during the day, the social talks after the conference are equally important to establish trust and partnerships. We also believe that Europe integrates many regions with different cultures and to build European trust based partnerships we need to learn about the culture of regions. So please join the networking space and social events. 
  Key Notes  
 Key notes are plenary sessions by key experts from industry or research. Key notes (if accepted) are used to create key statements in the EuroSPI Youtube channel. We have every year 5 key notes from leading industry and research. Please visit our key notes page and the EuroSPI Youtube channel. We also invite key industry at the EuroSPI technology day, please visit our technology day page and download the free available presentations. 
  Workshop Communities  
 The thematic workshops allow leading industry and research to attend EuroAsiaSPI not only for a conference but also for a dedicated topic based workshop/training event. These workshop are dealing with hot topics and contain key papers and interactive sessions with open discussions. Participants work with the speakers to elaborate key statements to follow up in the next years workshops. The thematic workshops will be published as separate chapters in the annual SPRINGER book in the CCIS series.

 SPI Manifesto 
  Conference Programme  
 The 2024 conference program has been published. See below!  
 EuroSPI² 2024 (4 - 6 September 2024) has 9 international thematic workshop streams supported by thematic topic communities. Each thematic stream integrates both, research sessions and industry / applied science sessions. The thematic streams are a mix of talks provoking discussions, full presentations and panel discussions which focus on specific questions of interest. In addition there is a half day about new research and industry project and funding proposal ideas. Some streams run longer than one day depending on the size of the community and contributions.  
 Each thematic workshop   covers specific thematic topics and mixes research and industry presentations/discussions on that specific topic.   
 Associated Technology Day - Pre-Conference Event (2 September 2024)  
 The associated technology day is a half day online event on 2 September 2024, with key note speakers presenting most recent developments. It can be attended free of cost. A link to the online conference will be published and the access to the presentations and discussions will be free. There are key note presentations  and content based webinar sessions  . Key note sessions are from leading industry or experts, and webinar sessions are presenting first and then using tools to which attendees can access in a gamified scenario. This pre-conference event on 2 September 2024 is free of cost.   
 See the technology day page  .  
 The EuroSPI 2024 Program (Joint EuroSPI and ICSSP 2024  event)  
 The conference has 5 parallel streams. This year the  ISSPA  joins forces and the ICSSP conference  will form a 5th stream of the EuroSPI conferebce. Attendees register for the whole event and can attend EuroSPI as well as the ICSSP stream. Each stream contains a mix of research and industry/applied science papers/presentations. Also each stream contains a mix of pitch talks (show key message and discuss) and full presentations. Also there will be one special session for discussing new funding proposals and finding partners for ideas. The future conference strategy of EuroSPI² is to gather core topics and build communities around the core thematic topics. Leading industry and research lead the thematic topic streams.  
 Also EuroSPI² continuously builds the SPI strategy and understanding in Europe and the world and continues to promote and develop the SPI Manifesto  .  
 Attendees can book single days, any combination of 2 days, or all 3 days.

 Buses will bring the attendees to the Rosenheimer Herbstfest   
  Note: To reach the beer festival and not lose the places we must leave at 17.30 with the busses (sorry for that short transfer time, but later reservations are not possible because the festival is so well known that other people/groups/tourists will compete/pay/invest for the places onsite). The buses are directly in front of the building. You can either store your bags at the conference location (locked till next morning), or you can take them to the bus and you will have the same bus on the journey back. Have a nice typical Bavarian festival, if possible in Lederhosen!

 EuroVA 2023  
 Workshop   
 EuroVA 2023 ( eurova.org/eurova-2023  ) is the fourteenth international EuroVis Workshop on Visual Analytics.  
 It will take place on Monday, June 12, 2023, in Leipzig, Germany, and is co-located with Eurovis 2023, the Eurographics Conference on Visualization ( eurovis.org  ).  
 Visual Analytics is a problem-solving and sense-making approach that integrates analytical computations, visual representations, and interaction. It includes the analysis of complex (massive, heterogeneous, dynamic, uncertain, …) data and information for gaining understanding, building knowledge, and inferring insight. Visual Analytics aims at a synergistic collaboration of humans and computers mediated through interactive visual interfaces. As such, Visual Analytics is an interdisciplinary field of research, including aspects of visualization, human-computer interaction, data science, statistics and mathematics, data management and knowledge representation, data analysis and machine learning, cognitive and perceptual sciences.  
 EuroVA 2023 is the premier workshop in Europe to present and discuss fresh ideas on new methods and theories, novel applications, designs, and studies on the use of Visual Analytics methods and systems. The workshop will accept a wide range of contributions within the broad area of Visual Analytics, including novel techniques, systems, applications, evaluation studies and methods, and theoretical foundations, as well as fresh viewpoints on future challenges and critical reflections.  
  EuroVA proceedings will be published in the EG Digital Library  . EuroVA is also indexed in dblp  and Scopus.  
 Workshop Program   
 Opening Ceremony, with a keynote on | “Bridging AI and Visual Analytics” | by Alvitta Ottley and the Best Paper Award 
  Paper Session 1: Patterns and Multidimensional Projections 
  Session 3: Honorable Mention Paper and Panel 
  Paper Session 2: Decision-making and explanation 
  Call for Submissions   
 EuroVA seeks to attract innovative, fresh, and creative ideas with a high potential of becoming significant contributions to the Visual Analytics community.  
 We welcome contributions within the broad area of Visual Analytics, including:  
 research papers | presenting novel techniques or systems, evaluation studies and methods, and theoretical foundations, 
  Applications and problem-driven work, including but not limited to sports, medicine, biology, finance, security, telecommunication, travel, humanities …
