 COVID-19 Safety  
 We are excited to move towards a fully in-person event for our community in 2023! That said, it is our priority to ensure the safety and health of all participants. The organizers are monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic closely and will take measures as needed, including the possibility of enabling those who cannot travel to participate remotely.  
  For inquiries about the ICWSM Code of Conduct  , please contact icwsm23@aaai.org.   
  The International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM) is a forum for researchers from multiple disciplines to come together to share knowledge, discuss ideas, exchange information, and learn about cutting-edge research in diverse fields with the common theme of online social media. This overall theme includes research in new perspectives in social theories, as well as computational algorithms for analyzing social media. ICWSM is a singularly fitting venue for research that blends social science and computational approaches to answer important and challenging questions about human social behavior through social media while advancing computational tools for vast and unstructured data.  
  ICWSM, now in its seventeenth year, has become one of the premier venues for computational social science, and previous years of ICWSM  have featured papers, posters, and demos that draw upon network science, machine learning, computational linguistics, sociology, communication, and political science. The uniqueness of the venue and the quality of submissions have contributed to a rapidly growing conference, and a competitive acceptance rate of approximately 20% for full-length research papers published in the proceedings by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)  .  
  ICWSM-2023 will be held from June 5th – 8th at the St. Raphael Resort and Marina  in Limassol, Cyprus.

 The Shortcut - Why Intelligent Machines do not Think Like Us  
  Abstract:  The key to address our social anxieties in the face of Intelligent Machines is understanding how they “think”, what we can expect of them, and what can be the consequences of the specific type of intelligence that they exhibit, and the specific position we have chosen for them in our global data infrastructure, particularly web and social media. In order to do that, we will examine the fundamental steps that took us to the present form of AI, in particular the idea of the Shortcut. This will allow us to consider what we can expect from modern AI, and how we can manage our relation with it. (This talk will be based on the book “The Shortcut” by Nello Cristianini  ).  
 Bio:  Nello Cristianini is a Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bath, and a researcher in many areas of Artificial Intelligence, including machine learning theory, natural language processing, social implications of AI, philosophical foundations of AI, computational social science. He is the author of “The Shortcut” published by CRC Press (2023).  
 Digital Inequality During COVID-19 Lockdowns  
  Abstract:  Rarely is access to information as important as during a global health crisis. During the initial COVID-19 lockdowns, at a time when information could mean the difference between life and death, information inequalities were of paramount significance. Drawing on national survey data collected in the early days of the pandemic in three countries (US, Italy, Switzerland), this talk shares how people’s digital privilege related to their knowledge and misconceptions about the virus with consequences for whether they stayed safe during lockdowns.  
 Bio:  Eszter Hargittai is Professor and holds the Chair of Internet Use and Society at the Institute of Communication and Media Research of the University of Zurich. She is Fellow of the International Communication Association and an External Member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Hargittai's research looks at how people may benefit from or be left behind as a result of their varied digital media skills and uses. Her work has received awards from several professional associations. Her latest book is Connected in Isolation: Digital Privilege in Unsettled Times published by The MIT Press in 2022.

 ICWSM Scholarships   
 We are pleased to announce the availability of a number of scholarships to help support student attendance at ICWSM-23. These scholarships are made possible through the engagement with, and kind contribution of, AAAI and our company sponsors.  
  Student Travel Grant   
 The student travel grant assists student participants both with travel to Limassol, Cyprus, as well as with conference expenses (such as housing, local transportation to/from the airport, conference registration, etc.). Please note that it intends to subsidize student participation in ICWSM-23, but does not intend to cover all travel and conference expenses. The final amount will vary depending on the cost of the travel, the available funds, and the number and type of applicants. The eligibility of this travel grant includes both active student program enrollment and physical presence at ICWSM-23 or any of the associated workshops.  
  Virtual Grant for Underrepresented Groups   
 Note that this virtual grant is not limited to students, it is open to anyone from underrepresented groups (e.g., women, persons with disabilities, etc.) and/or regions (e.g., African countries). There are no conditions for accepting this grant. We only ask that you attend the event and enjoy the sessions. We would, of course, also be happy if you decide to join our ICWSM and Computational Social Science community.  
 ICWSM Awards  
 ICWSM Adamic-Glance Distinguished Young Researcher Award  
 This annual award is presented to a young researcher who has distinguished themself through innovative research in the area of social computing/computational social science in the early stage of their independent research career. The award is named after Lada Adamic  and Natalie Glance  , two outstanding researchers who have made significant contributions to the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM) in particular and social computing/computational social science in general. The ICWSM research community at large has greatly impacted this field, through identifying the connections between online digital behaviors and critical societal questions and issues. From misinformation and fake news to how we can use social media and social networks to gain insight into political polarization, mental health, and social movements, the range of topics addressed by the community is continuously expanding. We want to recognize and celebrate the young researchers who are making these contributions today.  
  Nomination Process and Eligibility  
 Self-nominations, nominations, and letters of support are elicited. ICWSM strongly encourages individuals from underrepresented groups in research (based on gender identity, race, ethnicity, geographical location, etc.) to self-nominate, and urges the wide community to nominate young researchers who have distinguished themselves for their creativity and rigor in identifying and addressing important research topics of societal impact. Nominations are open from February 1st to March 1st 2023. Use this Google Form  for submission.  
  Eligibility Criteria  
  Have received their PhD within the past 7 years. Career interruptions and other special circumstances will be considered and should be mentioned in the nomination justification document. 
  Perform research that is recognizably within the broad field of social computing/computational social science in terms of their thematic and methodological approaches. 
  Have published their research in the top venues for social computing or computational social science, including active participation in ICWSM. 
  As long as a candidate is eligible based on the three criteria above, they will be considered even if they were nominated or self-nominated in prior years.  
  Selection Process  
 The selection committee consists of three to five members and is appointed by the AAAI ICWSM Steering Committee Chair. The committee solicits self-nominations, nominations, and letters of support from the social computing/computational social science community. The selection is based on the impact of the candidate's work in the field: in identifying significant new problems, creating promising new ideas, paradigms, and tools related to data-driven understanding of human behavior, which may be quantitative or qualitative in nature. Depth and impact are valued over breadth of contribution for this award. A strong regard for considering the ethical aspects of the data/methods used in social computing/computational social science is expected of the research record of the nominees.  
  The nomination form  asks the following questions:  
  Note for letters of support:  The form makes it easy to submit letters of support from people other than the nominators or self-nominators. Such individuals will not need to complete the details of the nomination, they will simply upload their letter.  
  Form accessibility:  The nomination form requires Google authentication. If for any reason this is a problem for the nominator, please send the nomination materials via email to: adamic-glance-award@icwsm.org  .  
  Conflict of interest:  The awards committee takes conflict of interest seriously. If an nominated individual is a former or current collaborator of one or more of the committee members, such member(s) recuse themselves from evaluating and voting on these nominations.

 We are now on Bluesky! 🦋  
  The International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM) is a forum for researchers from multiple disciplines to come together to share knowledge, discuss ideas, exchange information, and learn about cutting-edge research in diverse fields with the common theme of investigating the interplay of web and society. This overall theme includes research on new perspectives in social theories, as well as computational algorithms for analyzing digital traces of human activities or behaviors in social settings. ICWSM is a singularly fitting venue for research that blends social science and computational approaches to answer important and challenging questions about human social behavior through online traces while advancing computational tools for vast and unstructured data.  
  ICWSM, now in its nineteenth year, has become one of the premier venues for computational social science and social computing. Previous years  of ICWSM have featured papers, posters, and demos that draw upon a wide spectrum of disciplines from computational sciences (e.g., network science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, test/data mining natural language processing, image/multimedia processing, human computer interaction) to social sciences (e.g., sociology, communication, political science, anthropology, psychology, economics, digital humanities). Note that papers focusing solely on the advancement of algorithmic components or which use Web data only as an artifact (for instance, in method evaluation) are out of scope. Ideal submissions should speak to research questions of societal relevance.  
  We invite original work that utilizes diverse digitally mediated data sources such as web navigation traces, traces from apps, social media traces, data from online platforms such as microblogs (e.g., X/ formerly Twitter), wiki-based knowledge sharing sites (e.g., Wikipedia), online news media (e.g., Huffington Post), forums, mailing lists, newsgroups community media sites (e.g., YouTube, Instagram), Q&A sites (e.g., Quora Stack Overflow), user review sites (e.g., Yelp, Amazon.com), search platforms and social curation sites (e.g., Reddit, Pinterest). Adapting to our continuously evolving field, we are open to new forms of technologically mediated human or society-related data sources (e.g., mobility traces, satellite data) and methods that advance our understanding of society and the influence of the web on it.  
  The uniqueness of the venue and the quality of submissions have contributed to a rapidly growing conference, and a competitive acceptance rate of approximately 20 to 30% for full-length research papers published in the proceedings by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)  .

 Brief Full Paper Submission Information  
 Full Paper Submission Site (new submissions only - not revisions)   
 Register or log in to PCS account to access the above link 
  After registering/logging in, click on the Submissions tab and make the following selections from the dropdown menus: Society: AAAI. Conference/Journal: ICWSM 25. Track: ICWSM 25 January Submissions. 
  After clicking "Go" a placeholder submission will appear in the table below. Click on "Edit Submission" to add your paper details. 
  The submission will be marked complete when you have entered all the required fields, but you will still be able to make edits until submissions are closed. 
 Authors who receive the "Accept" recommendation will have the opportunity to respond to reviewer suggestions by making minor edits when preparing the camera-ready version. Authors who receive the "Revise and Resubmit" recommendation will have the opportunity to address reviewer suggestions and resubmit an improved manuscript in the next submission deadline.  
 See the complete submission guidelines  below for more information.  
 Full Formatting Guidelines for Paper Submission  
 Content Guidelines   
 Language   : All submission must be in English.   
 Revisions   : Papers that were previously submitted to ICWSM and received a "Revise and Resubmit " decision should be accompanied by a copy of the previous reviews and an author response statement. The response statement may be in any format, but many reviewers appreciate a response that begins with an overall summary and then includes a table, with each row containing a reviewer comment in the left cell, and author's response in the right cell. The response cell may explain why no changes were made, or may describe changes and direct the reviewer to a particular page, section, or figure, where the revised content appears. At the discretion of the Senior PC member handling the paper, the revised version may be sent back to some or all of the original reviewers for comment and evaluation, and may also be sent to additional reviewers.   
 Disclosure of funding and competing interests:   Authors are required to provide an explicit disclosure of funding (financial activities supporting the submitted work) and competing interests (related financial activities outside the submitted work) that could result in conflicts of interest, in a section (e.g., “Acknowledgments”) that should be added to the camera-ready version of accepted papers, but not in the version submitted for review (in order to maintain author anonymity). Furthermore, authors are required to read the  AAAI code of conduct and ethics guidelines   ; submitting to ICWSM implies that the authors agree to abide by these rules.  
 Resubmission:   Authors will need to declare if a previous version of their submission was rejected at any peer-reviewed venue, and, if so, summarize the changes made in the current version and include the original review. Authors of rejected papers from ICWSM may revise and submit their revised papers after 6 months of the date of the last decision, but not before. For example, papers submitted in the January round can be resubmitted to the September round (6 months after the decision in March) but not the May round. This decision was made to avoid paper rejections due to lack of time for revisions and to discourage authors from submitting papers that are not ready.   
 Policy on Authorship:   ICWSM'25 will adopt the following subsection of ACM's new policy on authorship  , restated here: Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc. If you are uncertain about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the Acknowledgements section of the Work. Basic word processing systems that recommend and insert replacement text, perform spelling or grammar checks and corrections, or systems that do language translations are to be considered exceptions to this disclosure requirement and are generally permitted and need not be disclosed in the Work.   
 All submissions from that author will be disqualified from the current ICWSM conference 
  And authors will not be permitted to submit papers to the ICWSM conference in the following year. 
  Conference Registration  : Authors will be contacted about how to register for the conference. General registration for this year’s conference will open soon. Stay tuned!   
 Publication  : All accepted papers and extended abstracts will be published in the conference proceedings, except for those submitted to the 'social sciences and sociophysics (not for publication)'; only abstracts will be published for those. Though initial submissions of full papers must not exceed 11 pages, full papers accepted for publication will be allocated up to twelve (12) pages in the conference proceedings to facilitate authors in addressing comments raised by the reviewers. Authors will be required to transfer copyright to AAAI.   
 Datasets  : ICWSM provides a service for hosting datasets pertaining to research presented at the conference. Authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to share the datasets on which their papers are based, while adhering to the terms and conditions of the data provider. Of these datasets, one will be selected for an award which will be based on the quality, scope, and timeliness of each dataset. More information will be available on our website.   
 The format of workshops will be determined by their organizers. The two main criteria for the selection of the workshops will be the following:   
 The organizers encourage workshops that promote different types of activities, including challenges, games, brainstorming, and networking sessions. The organizers discourage workshops that are structured as mini-conferences dominated by long talks and short discussions. Workshops should leave ample time for discussions and interaction between the participants and should also encourage the submission and presentation of position papers that discuss new research ideas. 
  The workshop should have the potential to attract the interest of researchers in computer science and social science. Proposals involving people of different backgrounds in the organizing committee and addressing topics at the intersection of different disciplines will have a higher chance of acceptance. 
  Workshop organizers who want to publish the papers from their workshop (or significant portions of it) will have the opportunity to do so through workshop proceedings by the AAAI Press. For a list of last year's workshops see here  .   
 Workshop Proposal Contents   
 Proposals for workshops should be no more than five (5) pages in length (10pt, single column with reasonable margins), written in English, and should contain the following:   
 A concise title. 
  The names, affiliations, and contact information of the organizing committee. A main contact author should be specified. 
  An indication as to whether the workshop should be considered for a half-day or full-day meeting. 
  A short abstract describing the scope and main objective of the workshop. Identify the specific issues and research questions the workshop will focus on, with a brief discussion of why the topic is of particular interest at this time and for which research communities. 
  A short bio for each member of the organizing committee, including a description of their relevant expertise. Strong proposals include organizers who bring differing perspectives to the workshop topic and who are actively connected to the communities of potential participants. 
  A brief statement on whether any generative AI tools were used to generate ideas for the workshop or the workshop activities. Workshop organizers strongly discourage the use of generative AI to come up with workshop ideas and activities. 
  Please use the AAAI Author Kit  to format your submission. Your proposal should be emailed in a single file to the workshop chairs (Luca Rossi, Shruti Phadke, and Akhil Arora) at workshops@icwsm.org  before the deadline. For additional information please contact the workshop chairs at the same address.   
 Lecture-style:   Traditional tutorials to teach concepts, methodologies, tools, and software packages. Tutorials on novel and fast growing directions and significant applications are highly encouraged. The conference is paying particular attention to themes around new perspectives in social theories, as well as computational algorithms for analyzing new forms of social media. Lecture-style tutorials on these themes are highly encouraged.   
 Hands-on:   Interactive, in-depth, hands-on training on cutting edge systems and tools (with a proven track record in the community), targeted at novice as well as moderately skilled users, with a focus on providing an engaging experience. The pace of the tutorial should be set such that beginners can follow along comfortably.   
 Translation:   Tutorials that aim to translate concepts between disciplines. For example, such a tutorial could introduce social science concepts to computer scientists, or computational concepts to social scientists. Thus these tutorials should be geared towards a beginner audience.   
 Case study:   Focused tutorials that emphasize real world applications of ICWSM work. These tutorials should walk the audience through how research insights and tools were applied in practice. We welcome submissions from practitioners in industry, government, and NGOs in addition to academics.   
 Free-style:   We also welcome proposals for creative and unconventional training sessions, such as hackathons competitions/challenges, etc., as long as participants can learn practical skills and participate in an active way.   
 Acceptance Criteria   
 The format will be entirely determined by the tutorial organizers—i.e., you! Proposals will be selected for inclusion considering the following criteria:   
 Relevance, interest, and value of the topic to ICWSM attendees and research communities. 
  Cross-pollination potential. Tutorials that attract an interdisciplinary audience will be given preference. The proposals should highlight, when applicable, the tutorial's potential to transfer knowledge from one discipline/area to another. 
  Interactivity. We will favor tutorials that aim to include hands-on experiences collaborative approaches, and interactivity. 
  Type.  The type of tutorial you are proposing: lecture-style, hands-on, translation case study, or free-style. 
  Names, affiliations, emails, and personal websites of the tutorial organizers.  A main contact author should be specified. A typical proposal should include no more than three presenters (more people can be involved in the organization). 
  Duration.  A short timeline description of how you plan to break down the material over the proposed duration (1, 2, 4, or 8 hours). Please mention here the proposed duration, but keep in mind that the Tutorial Chairs might conditionally accept a proposal and suggest a different duration to best fit the organization of the whole event. 
  Tutorial schedule and activities.  A description of the proposed tutorial format, a schedule of the proposed activities (e.g., presentations, interactive sessions) along with a *detailed* description for each of them. 
  Target audience, prerequisites and outcomes.  A description of the target audience, the prerequisite skill set for the attendee (if any) as well as a brief list of goals for the tutors to accomplish by the end of the tutorial. 
 This scheme’s goal is to support young scholars, in particular in low-and-middle-income countries, and to increase ICWSM’s appeal to scholars in adjacent communities.  
  Before submitting your manuscript via a web form  , you will need to confirm that:  
 None of the authors has any prior ICWSM full papers, not counting poster, dataset or workshop papers. 
  Your manuscript is complete (typically 7-11 pages in a two-column format) without any missing sections. 
  You are available to substantially revise your paper between August 22 and September 15. 
  The manuscript presents academic research related to “the Web and social media”, broadly defined. 
  We also ask you to check whether the first author’s affiliation country qualifies as a low, lower-middle, or upper-middle income economy according to the World Bank classification  . Authors from these countries will be given priority if mentoring demand exceeds mentoring capacity.  
 Similarly, in the submission form, we ask about prior experience with non-full-paper publications, e.g. dataset, poster or workshop publications, and about prior ICWSM attendance. Authors without any ICWSM experience will be given priority if mentoring demand exceeds mentoring capacity.  
 While not required, we suggest you follow the formatting guidelines  for ICWSM 2024 to save the time needed later for reformatting. However please include the author and affiliation information in the manuscript for the mentoring scheme.

 Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA 2023)  
  IDA 2023 will take place at UCLouvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, 12-14 April 2023.  
  Advancing Intelligent Data Analysis  requires novel, potentially game-changing ideas. IDA’s mission is to promote ideas over performance: a solid motivation can be as convincing as exhaustive empirical evaluation. Therefore IDA accepts all inspiring papers for both presentation and publication. In order to create an open atmosphere that encourages discussion, the IDA symposium is intentionally small-scale and single-track.  
 The program of the symposium is now available: Full Program  .  
 Early registration is possible till March 25, 2023.

 Abstract:  The quest for transparency in black-box models has gained significant momentum in recent years. In particular, discovering the underlying machine learning technique type (or model family) from the performance of a black-box model is a real important problem both for better understanding its behaviour and for developing strategies to attack it by exploiting the weaknesses intrinsic to the learning technique. In this paper, we tackle the challenging task of identifying which kind of machine learning model is behind the predictions when we interact with a black-box model. Our innovative method involves systematically querying a black-box model (oracle) to  …  label an artificially generated dataset, which is then used to train different surrogate models using machine learning techniques from different families (each one trying to partially approximate the oracle’s behaviour). We present two approaches based on similarity measures, one selecting the most similar family and the other using a conveniently constructed meta-model. In both cases, we use both crisp and soft classifiers and their corresponding similarity metrics. By experimentally comparing all these methods, we gain valuable insights into the explanatory and predictive capabilities of our model family concept. This provides a deeper understanding of the black-box models and increases their transparency and interpretability, paving the way for more effective decision making.  Show more

 Abstract:  Empirical evidence has shown that forecast combination can improve the prediction accuracy of tourism demand forecasting. This paper aimed to develop a more accurate grey forecast combination method (GFCM) with multivariate grey prediction models In light of the practical applicability of grey prediction, which is not required to apply any statistical test to examine data series this research features the use of multivariate grey models through the genetic algorithm to synthesize forecasts from univariate grey prediction models commonly used in tourism forecasting into composite forecasts Empirical results showed that the proposed GFCM significantly outperformed the other combination methods considered. The  …  results also suggested that the risk of forecast failures caused by selecting an inappropriate single model for tourism demand forecasting can be reduced by using the GFCM.  Show more
