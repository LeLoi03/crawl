 Welcome  
 The Conference.  The annual ACM SIGMOD/PODS Conference is a leading international forum for database researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and results, and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences. The conference includes a fascinating technical program with research and industrial talks, tutorials, demos, and focused workshops. It also hosts a poster session to learn about innovative technology, an industrial exhibition to meet companies and publishers, and a careers-in-industry panel with representatives from leading companies.  
 The Conference Hotel.  The conference will be held at the InterContinental Berlin, a modern and internationally renowned hotel, distinctive with its checkerboard façade and one of the most famous hotels in Berlin. The location directly at the famous "Tiergarten" and just a short walk from the iconic Brandenburg Gate makes the InterContinental Berlin an exclusive starting point for exploring the multicultural metropolis. It is one of Germany's leading conference and event venues, providing an outstanding stage for events of all kinds. It was honored with the "Europe's Leading Conference Hotel" award at the World Travel Awards 2024.
