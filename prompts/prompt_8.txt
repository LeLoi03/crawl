 The Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC)  brings together cutting-edge researchers, with a broad cross-section of security professionals drawn from academia, industry, and government, gathered to present and discuss the latest security results and topics. With peer reviewed technical papers, invited talks, panels, national interest discussions, and workshops, ACSAC continues its core mission of investigating practical solutions for computer and network security technology.  
 ACSAC will be held at the AT&T Conference Center in Austin, Texas. The hotel is 8 miles from the airport, with many attractions and restaurants within walking distance or a short ride.

 Hard Topic Theme: Trustworthy Systems   
 This year's hard topic theme solicits research results and technologies that are considering the concept of trustworthy systems. Trustworthy systems generally involve the development of capabilities that offer security, safety, and reliability guarantees. ACSAC has always solicited work on applied security; with this hard topic, we hope to put great emphasize on deployable trustworthy systems.

  Conference Presentation/Publication Policy  
 The proceedings of the Asilomar conference are meant to be a written record of the presentations provided at the conference. In other words, these proceedings are not a medium for general publication of scientific results; rather, they serve a more specific and narrow purpose which is to summarize the discussions that occurred during the Conference.  
 It is the long-term Conference policy to restrict publication in the proceedings to papers which were presented live  at the conference by one of the registered  authors of the paper who is physically present at the conference. There is no exception to this policy.  
 No more than 4 papers (combination of invited and regular) papers per author or co-author will be accepted for presentation at the conference or published in the proceedings.  
 The conference executive committee and IEEE reserve the right to exclude a final paper submission from inclusion in the conference proceedings, if the final paper submission does not meet conference or IEEE standards for scope and/or quality.  
  The Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers is a yearly Conference held on the Asilomar Grounds in Pacific Grove CA, USA. The IEEE Signal Processing Society is a technical co-sponsor. It provides a forum for presenting recent and novel work in various areas of theoretical and applied signal processing.  
 General areas of interest to the forum include:  
 Architectures & Implementation

Paper Submission Guidelines  
 Final conference papers are reports of the conference presentation and are due after the conference. The IEEE is a technical co-sponsor and post-conference final papers are required to adhere to IEEE publication standards.  As such, final papers should be limited to the work presented during the conference. Methods and material contained should be described in sufficient details to permit evaluation and replication. Toward that goal, final conference papers are expected to include the following elements:  
 Abstract 
  Introduction 
  Acknowledgement 
  References 
  The full paper can have up to 8 pages. However, the authors have to pay additional page charges for every page that exceeds 5 pages.   
 The conference executive committee and IEEE reserve the right to exclude a final paper submission from inclusion in the conference proceedings, if the final paper submission does not meet conference or IEEE standards for scope and/or quality.  
 Note to authors submitting papers:  
  IEEE standards | are to be met for paper submission. 
  No more than four submissions are allowed per contributor, as author or co-author.
