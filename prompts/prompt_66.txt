 27th International Conference on Developments in Language Theory  
  Umeå, Sweden  
  June 12-16, 2023  
 The International Conference on Developments in Language Theory (DLT 2023) is an event organized to bring together members of the academic, research, and industrial community who have an interest in formal languages, automata theory, and related areas (see possible topics below). The conference will be held in conjunction with the 14th International Conference on Words (WORDS 2023) in Umeå, Sweden, one week before midsummer. Hence, for those attending it may be a good opportunity to extend their stay in northern Sweden by a week.  
 During the conference, one or more prizes for the best student papers  (sponsored by MDPI) will be awarded.  
 Important Dates  
 Deadline for abstract  submission:  February 19, 2023  
  Deadline for paper  submission:  February 26, 2023  
  Notification:  April 1, 2023  
  Final Version:  April 10, 2023  
  DLT 2023:  June 12-16, 2023  
 Deadlines are strict  and will not be extended!  
 Submission Guidelines  
 In order to facilitate the review process, all proofs omitted due to page limitations can be given in an appendix or made accessible through a reliable link to a freely available electronic preprint. Please note that the paper should be self-contained; reviewers are not required to read any additional pages, thus consulting the appendix is up to the reviewer. Papers should be submitted electronically in PDF through the EasyChair system:  
 All questions about submissions should be emailed to drewes@cs.umu.se  .

 About the Conference  
  SIAM Annual Meeting (AN24)   
  SIAM Conference on Applied Mathematics Education (ED24)   
 Discrete mathematics has a wide range of challenging research problems and important applications in industry. In addition to core combinatorial problems and techniques, modern research in the field encompasses approaches from many other areas of mathematics including algebra, topology, geometry, probability, analysis and logic. Its applications span computer science, the physical, biological, and social sciences, telecommunications, information processing, and manufacturing, and it is widely used by businesses and industries to improve efficiency. This conference will highlight major theoretical advances in discrete mathematics, the development of new tools and techniques, and significant new applications to problems from industry and science. It will also bring together participants from the many different environments where discrete mathematics is developed and applied.

   DocEng'23  
 The 23 rd  ACM Symposium on Document Engineering (DocEng'23) seeks original research papers that focus on the design, implementation, development, management, use and evaluation of advanced systems where documents and document collections play a key role. DocEng emphasizes innovative approaches to document engineering technology, use of documents and document collections in real-world applications, and novel principles, tools and processes that improve our ability to create, manage, maintain, share, and productively use these.  
 In particular, DocEng'23 seeks contributions in the area of cooperative work with documents.  
 You are invited to submit original papers to DocEng'23, to be held in University of Limerick, Ireland. Attendees at this international forum have interests that span all aspects of document engineering and applications.  
 DocEng'23 is organised by the University of Limerick, Ireland as a full, in person event.  
 Keynote Speakers  
 We are delighted to announce two wonderful keynote speakers for DocEng'23:  
  Gary Moloney - The evolution and growth of engineering documents for consumer engagement  .  
 Product and service differentiation by virtue of delivering a unique personalized consumer experience is considered by many as the next competitive battleground. Due to the e-commerce sales surge during the pandemic more often these days the consumers first tangible interaction with the brand is now upon receipt of a package purchased online. Brands look at the consumer touchpoints with the brand, its packaging and labels, as more and more critical in delivering and managing an event-based-experience.  
 How you “engineer” your users to engage is the human factor/behavioral element of document engineering. This presentation will look at real-life examples of how brands are evolving their strategies when focussing on event based experiences to both deliver new brand marketing/consumer experience strategies and to create data sets from the consumer engagement to address both old-age business problems and challenges and some new emerging ones.  
 Gary  is a technology innovation centre manager, engineer, and experienced technology services executive. He has a proven track record of developing & leading award winning commercially successful cloud services rd&i in multinational corporate environments. Gary has 25+ years’ strong domain expertise and experience of building & managing technology teams in successfully delivering innovative technology-based services & solutions related to product & supply chain traceability, brand protection/counterfeit detection and prevention, brand promotion & consumer engagement.

  The 23 rd  ACM Symposium on Document Engineering  
 August 22, 2023 to August 25, 2023   
  Limerick, Ireland   
 Overview  
 This is the main structure of the DocEng'23 programme:  
  Friday 25th of August 9AM - 2PM, Day 3 of the Symposium 
 DocEng’23 Programme  
  Tuesday 22nd of August. Tutorials Day  
 Wednesday 23rd of August. Day 1  
 Thursday 24th of August. Day 2  
 Friday 25th of August. Final day.  
 Tutorials Overview  
 We are delighted to announce two very interesting and exciting tutorials that will be presented on the 22nd of August.  
 Looking Beneath the Surface: The Science and Applications of Eye-Gaze Tracking for Assessing Visual Attention  
  Duration:  3 hours (half-day)  
   Duration:  3 hours (half-day)  
  Speakers:  Dr Bonnici and Prof. Simske  
  Rationale:  Love it or hate it, the peer review process (whether open, blind, or even double-blind) has become the standard and accepted way of assessing the quality of papers before publication, be it for a conference, journal, or book. Indeed, forming the program committee is an essential part in any conference organisation and a good program committee may well be the differentiator from peer conferences. However, we have all been the recipients of a less than stellar/helpful review: from the snarky ones to the one-liners, these reviews can be demoralising and can give the peer-review process a bad reputation! The scope of this tutorial is then to encourage researchers to become more involved in the peer-review process by joining program committees and encourages good practices to collectively strengthen the quality of the peer-review process.

 Social Events  
  We are happy to announce that on the evening of Wednesday the 23rd of August we will have the gala dinner and Irish Traditional music arranged in The Castletroy Park Hotel.  
 Thursday, the 24th of August afternoon we will invite you to go on a road trip on the amazing Atlantic Coast and experience part of the Wild Atlantic Way  !  
 The Cliffs of Moher, the most famous cliffs in Ireland, will leave you awestruck, creating memories that will stay with you forever.
