  Abstract:  Aim/Purpose. The most crucial aspects of teaching a foreign language to more advanced learners are building an awareness of discourse modes, how to regulate discourse, and the pragmatic properties of discourse components. However, in different languages, the connections and structure of discourse are ensured by different linguistic means which makes matters complicated for the learner. Background. By uncovering regularities in a foreign language and comparing them with patterns in one’s own tongue, the corpus research method offers the student unique opportunities to acquire linguistic knowledge about discourse markers. This paper reports on an investigation of the functions of multi-word discourse markers. Methodology. In our research, we combine the alignment model of the phrase-based statistical machine translation and manual treatment of the data in order to examine English multi-word discourse markers and their equivalents in Lithuanian and Hebrew translations by researching their changes in translation. After establishing the full list of multi-word discourse markers in our generated parallel corpus, we research how the multi-word discourse markers are treated in translation. Contribution. Creating a parallel research corpus to identify multi-word expressions used as discourse markers, analyzing how they are translated into Lithuanian and Hebrew, and attempting to determine why the translators made the choices add value to corpus-driven research and how to manage discourse. Findings. Our research proves that there is a possible context-based influence guiding the translation to choose a particle or other lexical item integration in Lithuanian or Hebrew translated discourse markers to express the rhetorical domain which could be related to the so-called phenomenon of “over-specification.” Recommendations for Practitioners. The comparative examination of discourse markers provides language instructors and translators with more specific information about the roles of discourse markers. Recommendations for Researchers. Understanding the multifunctionality of discourse markers provides new avenues for discourse marker application in translation research. Impact on Society. The current study may be a useful method to strengthen students’ language awareness and analytic skills and is particularly important for students specializing in English philology or translation. Beyond the empirical research, an extensive parallel data resource has been created to be openly used. Future Research. It should be noted that the observed phenomenon of “over-specification” could be analyzed further in future research.

    Copy Citation   
  Illustration | : The meaning or implications of a particular theory are explained and clarified through an illustrative example. In the business literature, for example, nearly all practitioner-directed publications use this technique extensively. 
   We must never forget that our transdisciplinary mission demands that we view facilitating informing across the client disciplines as an important form of research. Providing a reader in one discipline with a novel perspective—even if that perspective is not necessarily novel in the discipline of the author—is a necessary part of transdisciplinary knowledge creation.   As a consequence of this expanded view of research, the journals and conferences sponsored by the ISI cover a very broad array of topics, research methods and styles of presentation.  
 3.2. Research Themes in Informing Science   
 Although much of the research in informing science does not fit within simple categories, there have been a number of themes that have captured the particular interest of researchers in the field. These include:  
 4.1. Journals   
 The ISI currently publishes thirteen journals, though two of these journals now function as passive repositories. Three of its journals are published in collaboration with other institutions. See Table 2 for a list of journals currently published solely by the ISI. These journals cover several common themes that have been established by the ISI. These include:  
 Free open access to the online version of every article is available as soon as each article is accepted for final publication and appropriately formatted 
  Articles are published under a Creative Commons license, allowing others to freely use their content (with proper attribution) 
 These are Muma Case Review  , Muma Business Review  , and International Journal of Community Development and Management Studies  . Partner journals agree to abide by the ISI's high standards for the treatment of authors and reviewers, but handle their own paper formatting and printing.  
 The ISI family of journals is also somewhat unusual for a U.S.-head quartered research publication in that a large percentage of its journals' editors and authors are situated outside of the United States. As shown in Figure 6, only about a third of its authors have been affiliated with U.S. academic institutions.  
 4.2. InSITE Conferences   
 InSITE: Connect | consists of study in various locations on the transmission of information across time and across space. Connect focuses on the interrelationship between context (his-torical forces and culture) and information and knowledge transfer. 
  InSITE: Inform | solicits papers in any area that explores issues in effectively and efficiently informing clients through information technology (IT). 
  InSITE: TeachIT | focuses on research topics related to teaching IT, including curricular is-sues, capstone courses, pedagogy, and emerging topics in IT. 
  InSITE: TeLE | focuses on research topics related to using IT to teach. For example, these topics include e-Learning, m-Learning, making classroom teaching more effective, and distance learning. 
  ISI has instituted a "fast track" process for article submissions to InSITE conferences. After all conference submissions have been reviewed, the editor-in-chiefs of ISI's seven journals identify articles that are of particularly high quality and are also a good fit with the journal's mission. Authors of these articles are then offered the opportunity to revise their submission for publication in the journal rather than in the conference proceedings.

 Issues related to Online testing techniques, and more generally to design for robustness, are increasingly important in modern electronic systems. In particular, the huge complexity of electronic systems has led to growth in reliability needs in several application domains and pressure for low-cost products. There is a corresponding increasing demand for cost-effective design for robustness techniques. These needs have increased dramatically with the introduction of nanometer technologies, which impact adversely noise margins; process, voltage, and temperature variations; aging and wear-out; soft error and EMI sensitivity; power density and heating; and make mandatory the use of design for robustness techniques for extending, yield, reliability, and lifetime of modern SoCs.  
 Design for reliability becomes also mandatory for reducing power dissipation, as voltage reduction, often used to reduce power, strongly affects reliability by reducing noise margins and thus the sensitivity to soft errors and EMI, and by increasing circuit delays and thus the severity of timing faults. There is also a strong relation between Design for Reliability and Design for Security, as security attacks are often fault-based.  
 The International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS) is an established forum for presenting novel ideas and experimental data on these areas. The Symposium is sponsored by the IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation (CEDA) and by the IEEE Computer Society Test Technology Technical Council (TTTC). T  he 2023 edition is organized by the Politecnico di Torino and the University of Athens.

 IoTBDS 2023 will be held in conjunction with ICT4AWE 2023    , COMPLEXIS 2023    and FEMIB 2023    .   
  Registration to IoTBDS allows free access to the ICT4AWE, COMPLEXIS and FEMIB conferences (as a non-speaker).  
  Although the conference is back to the normal mode (i.e., in-person) speakers are allowed to present remotely if unable to travel to the venue (hybrid support).    
 The internet of things (IoT) is a platform that allows a network of devices (sensors, smart meters, etc.) to communicate, analyze data and process information collaboratively in the service of individuals or organizations'. The IoT network can generate large amounts of data in a variety of formats and using different protocols which can be stored and processed in the cloud. The conference looks to address the issues surrounding IoT devices, their interconnectedness and services they may offer, including efficient, effective and secure analysis of the data IoT produces using machine learning and other advanced techniques, models and tools, and issues of security, privacy and trust that will emerge as IoT technologies mature and become part of our everyday lives.  
 Maintaining a high level of security and privacy for data in IoT are crucial and we welcome recommendations, solutions, demonstrations and best practices for all forms of security and privacy for IoT and BD.
