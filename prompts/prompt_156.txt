  THEME  
  These ghosts are however elusive, and difficult to identify or even just define at times. To try and learn more about the mind, research in artificial life and other related fields has more recently focused on studies of complexity, emergence,agency, autonomy, or information theory. As a results, this has led to major advancements in robotics, synthetic biology and artificial intelligence, among others. The main research programs in these areas however seem to be simply forgetting about the mind, rather than trying to explain it.  
  At the same time, with the advent of new technologies such as brain-machine interface, cyborgization, virtual/augmented reality and the metaverse, the boundaries between agents/living organisms and their environment have began fluctuating. Minds are no longer in our (living organism) shells, expanding beyond current spatial boundaries and into a new form of the “extended mind” hypothesis. At ALIFE 2023, we will bring back the focus to studies of the mind, facing the challenges and embracing the opportunities that come with studies of an often neglected but ever so important concept in both artificial life research and our daily lives.

          Conference Theme: Ghosts in the machine  
  Artificial life seeks to unravel the mysteries of life and mind, to naturalise the “ghosts in the machine”. What is life? What is the mind? Are these two concepts related?  
 These ghosts are however elusive, and difficult to identify or even just define at times. To try and learn more about the mind, research in artificial life and other related fields has more recently focused on studies of complexity, emergence, agency, autonomy, or information theory. As a results, this has led to major advancements in robotics, synthetic biology and artificial intelligence, among others. The main research programs in these areas however seem to be simply forgetting about the mind, rather than trying to explain it.  
 At the same time, with the advent of new technologies such as brain-machine interface, cyborgization, virtual/augmented reality and the metaverse, the boundaries between agents/living organisms and their environment have began fluctuating. Minds are no longer in our (living organism) shells, expanding beyond current spatial boundaries and into a new form of the "extended mind" hypothesis. At ALIFE 2023, we will bring back the focus to studies of the mind, facing the challenges and embracing the opportunities that come with studies of an often neglected but ever so important concept in both artificial life research and our daily lives.

 Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have also opened new possibilities for Human-AI interaction towards systems of co and augmented intelligence. On the other hand, developments regarding the practice of complex thinking, as a mode of coupling with the world that is organisationally coherent with the properties that organise complex natural and social systems, has been proposed as potentially leading to more effective ecosystemically positive and sustainable possibilities for action. It is hypothesised that more complex modes of thinking may lead to creative and abductive leaps capable of guiding effective interventions and the process of managing change in “real-world” complex systems, in conditions of uncertainty and risk. The CT & AI project will explore possibilities and limits of the interaction of a framework for the practice and promotion of Complex Thinking (CT) with AI tools based on LLMs (e.g. Chat GPT, Gemini). It aimed at developing and evaluating preliminary protocols to guide the integration of methods and tools for promoting CT with the use of AI tools towards generating complex understandings for practice and research. Finally, it aimed at exploring stakeholders (policy-makers, practitioners, scientists/academics) stances regarding the use of AI in relation to CT.

 School on Biological Physics across Scales: Pattern Formation. November 11 – 22, 2024, São Paulo, Brazil     
 Systems as different as the cellular cytoskeleton, microbial communities in soil, and savanna landscapes have in common the emergence of patterns: random yet organized spatial structures that form in an otherwise translationally invariant space. These structures emerge due to the local, individual-level interactions of agents – proteins, cells, trees – that, on a larger scale, result in nonlinear dynamics for the density field. Crucial phenomena hinge on the formation of these patterns: mitosis, embryo development, bacterial population survival, ecosystem’s robustness to aridification.  
 There is no registration fee and limited funds are available for travel and local expenses.

 Workshop: Demystifying machine learning for population researchers. November 5-6, Rostock, Germany     
 Advances in computational power and statistical algorithms, in conjunction with the increasing availability of large datasets, have led to a Cambrian explosion of machine learning (ML) methods. For population researchers, these methods are useful not only for predicting population dynamics but also as tools to improve causal inference tasks. However, the rapid evolution of this literature, coupled with terminological disparities from conventional approaches, renders these methods enigmatic and arduous for many population researchers to grasp.  
 This workshop on November 5 to 6, 2024 at the Max Planck Intsitute for Demographic Research (MPIDR) in Rostock, Germany, clarifies the goals, techniques, and applications of machine learning methods for population research. The workshop covers  
 an introduction to ML methods for population researchers,

 Thanks for joining us at a successful 2023.     
 We look forward to seeing you at CCNC 2024 on 12-15 January in Las Vegas at the Harrah’s Las Vegas!  
 Mobile App Now Live!     
 Welcome Message     
 I am pleased to welcome each and every one of you to the IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC) in the exciting city of Las Vegas. For several of us in the organizing side as well as the many researchers, developers, and practitioners from academia and industry who are attending this year, it is a first step back to normalcy- IEEE CCNC this year will be conducted in person! We are excited at the possibilities of the planned and casual intellectual conversations along the hallways, scribbles made in the coffee-breaks, professional networking during the social events, and most importantly, establishing meaningful person-to-person interactions after a long hiatus. Indeed, this year we have the largest number of registered attendees over the past decade and two exciting live keynotes from industry and academic leaders. The message is clear that the research community is resilient and looking forward to engaging in person!  
 Running a large conference like IEEE CCNC with several main tracks, work in progress (WIP), posters, demos, workshops is a mammoth task. For this, I would like to acknowledge primarily the incredible leadership of Prof. Bang Chul Jung (TPC Chair) who was aided in no small part by Prof. Silvia Mirri (TPC Vice Chair). A conference as large as this can only work if the submission/decision system (EDAS) is managed effectively. Many thanks to Prof. Zhanghyu Guan for being patient with our random requests at all the odd hours over the past eight months or so! Alongside the main tracks, we are pleased to present five workshops, which will allow more intimate discussions on specialized topics. For their role in selecting and shepherding the workshops, I must thank Prof. Thorsten Herfet and Prof. Won-Yong Shin. We have had off-the-charts interest in our poster-and-demo tracks this year. These tracks offer early exposure and feedback from the community, and many presenters return back the following year with main track submissions. Let me commend Demo Chairs Prof. Frank den Hartog and Dr. Ravikumar Balakrishnan, as well as Poster Chairs Profs. Jeongho Kwak and Kazuki Maruta, for handling this very large load so efficiently!  
 Beyond technical sessions alone, we hope that IEEE CCNC will be the forum for discussions and debate on topics like industry trends and the role of machine learning in wireless. These are indeed the areas that two panels will dive into, organized by Dr. Arjun Anand and Prof. Dola Saha, respectively. There will be plenty of opportunities to learn new skills and find new tools for research in the set of twelve tutorials selected by the Tutorial Chairs Profs. Ranga Rao Venkatesha Prasad and Tony Quek. If you read of IEEE CCNC through flyers, posts, emails and advertisements, these are directly due to the dedicated efforts of our Publicity Chairs Dr. Debashri Roy and Profs. Howon Lee and Gokhan Secinti. Also a shout out to our Awards Chair Prof. Claudio Casetti, Web Chair Mr. Ki-Hun Lee, Student Grant Chair: Dr. Alexander Gelman, and Publications Chair Mr. Luca Sciullo for serving in these capacities.  
 In closing, I would like to thank all our external patrons for supporting advanced research in the areas of consumer communications and networking. My sincere thanks also to the continuous guidance from the CCNC steering committee, including Dr. Alan Kaplan and Doug Zuckerman, and of course, to Ms. Melissa Torres from the IEEE who magically solves a lot of the complex logistics problems from the start to the end of the planning process!
