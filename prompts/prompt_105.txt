  IEEE Global Internet (GI) Symposium  
 The 28 th  IEEE Global Internet (GI) Symposium 2023   
 Organized in conjunction with  
 IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications,  
 17-20 May 2023, New York area, USA  
 The IEEE Global Internet (GI) Symposium is the flagship event established and organized by the Internet Technical Committee (ITC), a joint committee of the IEEE Communications Society (ComSoc) and the Internet Society (ISOC). The GI Symposium provides a top forum for researchers and practitioners to present and discuss advances in the current and future Internet and Internet-related technologies. The focus of the GI symposium is on experimental systems over the Internet and the design of future global Internet technologies, such as Information-Centric Networking (ICN), Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), network slicing, Artificial-Intelligence-based intelligent Internet, industrial Internet, and vehicular and drone networks, especially on a global Internet scale. The GI symposium also has a special focus on measurements-related aspects, besides the emerging technologies. In addition to the traditional research papers, we encourage papers with well-thought-through concepts and positions, papers that contrast proposed approaches, papers that clarify and compare inherent differences between competing technologies, and heresies.  
 The topics of interest for the GI 2023 include but are not limited to the following:  
 Routing, switching and addressing 
  Future Internet and next-generation network architectures 
  Economic aspects of the Internet and network neutrality

  Prospective authors are invited to submit original technical papers for presentation and publication. Accepted and presented technical papers will be published in the IEEE GLOBECOM 2023 Conference Proceedings and submitted to IEEE Xplore®.  
 Please address questions regarding a specific symposium or a SAC symposium track to the respective symposium co-chairs or the SAC symposium track chairs listed on the conference website.  
 Please make sure to follow the Author and Submission Guidelines  listed below.  
  AUTHOR AND SUBMISSION GUIDELINES   
 Important IEEE Policy Announcement: The IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (including its removal from IEEE Explore) if the paper is not presented at the conference.  
 Papers are reviewed on the basis that they do not contain plagiarized material and have not been submitted to any other conference at the same time (double submission). These matters are taken very seriously and the IEEE Communications society will take action against any author who engages in either practice. Follow these links to learn more:  
 IEEE Policy on Plagiarism   
  IEEE Policy on Double Submission   
 PLEASE NOTE:  To be published in the IEEE GLOBECOM 2023 Conference Proceedings and to be eligible for publication in IEEE Xplore®, an author of an accepted paper is required to register for the conference at the FULL or LIMITED (member or non-member) rate and the paper must be presented by an author of that paper at the conference unless the TPC Chair grants permission for a substitute presenter in advance of the event and who is qualified both to present and answer questions. Non-refundable registration fees must be paid prior to uploading the final IEEE formatted, publication-ready version of the paper. For authors with multiple accepted papers, one FULL or LIMITED registration is valid for up to 3 papers. Accepted and presented papers will be published in the IEEE GLOBECOM 2023 Conference Proceedings and submitted to IEEE Xplore®.  
 During the initial paper submission process via EDAS  , it is the authors' responsibility to ensure that the author list and the paper title of the submitted pdf file is an exact match to the author list and paper title on the EDAS  registration page. In particular, the EDAS  registration page must include all co-authors, not just the submitting author. Failure to comply with this rule might result in your paper being withdrawn from the review process. Please be aware that the author list of an accepted paper can NOT be changed in the final manuscript. Only PDF files will be accepted for the review process, and all submissions must be done through EDAS  .  
 IMPORTANT:   
 The page length limit for all initial submissions for review is SIX (6) printed pages (10-point font) and must be written in English. Initial submissions longer than SIX (6) pages will be rejected without review.  
  You may also use one of the following templates for Microsoft Word: A4, US letter.  
 Download Standard IEEE conference templates for LaTeX formats >>   
 If you have any questions regarding the submission of manuscripts, please contact one of the Technical Program Chairs of the Symposia that you are submitting a paper.
