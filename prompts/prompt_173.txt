 PLEASE NOTE:   
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, October 3, 2024. 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 10, 2024 | (firm deadline). 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.

 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.

  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.

  Abstract    
 Several works have recently investigated the parameterized complexity of data completion problems, motivated by their applications in machine learning, and clustering in particular. Interestingly, these problems can be equivalently formulated as classical graph problems on induced subgraphs of powers of partially-defined hypercubes. In this paper, we follow up on this recent direction by investigating the Independent Set problem on this graph class, which has been studied in the data science setting under the name Diversity. We obtain a comprehensive picture of the problem’s parameterized complexity and establish its fixed-parameter tractability w.r.t. the solution size plus the power of the hypercube. Given that several such FO-definable problems have been shown to be fixed-parameter tractable on the considered graph class, one may ask whether fixed-parameter tractability could be extended to capture all FO-definable problems. We answer this question in the negative by showing that FO model checking on induced subgraphs of hypercubes is as difficult as FO model checking on general graphs.

  Abstract    
 Given a graph G and an integer b, Bandwidth asks whether there exists a bijection π from V(G) to {1, …, |V(G)|} such that max_{{u, v} ∈ E(G)} | π(u) - π(v) | ≤ b. This is a classical NP-complete problem, known to remain NP-complete even on very restricted classes of graphs, such as trees of maximum degree 3 and caterpillars of hair length 3. In the realm of parameterized complexity, these results imply that the problem remains NP-hard on graphs of bounded pathwidth, while it is additionally known to be W[1]-hard when parameterized by the treedepth of the input graph. In contrast, the problem does become FPT when parameterized by the vertex cover number of the input graph. In this paper, we make progress towards the parameterized (in)tractability of Bandwidth. We first show that it is FPT when parameterized by the cluster vertex deletion number cvd plus the clique number ω of the input graph, thus generalizing the previously mentioned result for vertex cover. On the other hand, we show that Bandwidth is W[1]-hard when parameterized only by cvd. Our results generalize some of the previous results and narrow some of the complexity gaps.

  Abstract    
 Over the past decade, we witness an increasing amount of interest in the design of exact exponential-time and parameterized algorithms for problems in Graph Drawing. Unfortunately, we still lack knowledge of general methods to develop such algorithms. An even more serious issue is that, here, "standard" parameters very often yield intractability. In particular, for the most common structural parameter, namely, treewidth, we frequently observe NP-hardness already when the input graphs are restricted to have constant (often, being just 1 or 2) treewidth. Our work deals with both drawbacks simultaneously. We introduce a novel form of tree decomposition that, roughly speaking, does not decompose (only) a graph, but an entire drawing. As such, its bags and separators are of geometric (rather than only combinatorial) nature. While the corresponding parameter - like treewidth - can be arbitrarily smaller than the height (and width) of the drawing, we show that - unlike treewidth - it gives rise to efficient algorithms. Specifically, we get slice-wise polynomial (XP) time algorithms parameterized by our parameter. We present a general scheme for the design of such algorithms, and apply it to several central problems in Graph Drawing, including the recognition of grid graphs, minimization of crossings and bends, and compaction. Other than for the class of problems we discussed in the paper, we believe that our decomposition and scheme are of independent interest and can be further extended or generalized to suit even a wider class of problems. Additionally, we discuss classes of drawings where our parameter is bounded by 𝒪(√n) (where n is the number of vertices of the graph), yielding subexponential-time algorithms. Lastly, we prove which relations exist between drawn treewidth and other width measures, including treewidth, pathwidth, (dual) carving-width and embedded-width.

  Abstract    
 We study single-machine scheduling problems with few deadlines. We focus on two classical objectives, namely minimizing the weighted number of tardy jobs and the total weighted completion time. For both problems, we give a pseudopolynomial-time algorithm for a constant number of different deadlines. This algorithm is complemented with an ETH-based, almost tight lower bound. Furthermore, we study the case where the number of jobs with a nontrivial deadline is taken as parameter. For this case, the complexity of our two problems differ: Minimizing the total number of tardy jobs becomes fixed-parameter tractable, while minimizing the total weighted completion time is W[1]-hard.

  Abstract    
 This note describes our submission to the 2023 PACE Challenge on the computation of twin-width. Our solver Hydra Prime combines modular decomposition with a collection of upper- and lower-bound algorithms, which are alternatingly applied on the prime graphs resulting from the modular decomposition. We introduce two novel approaches which contributed to the solver’s winning performance in the Exact Track: timeline encoding and hydra decomposition. Timeline encoding is a new data structure for computing the width of a given contraction sequence, enabling faster local search; the hydra decomposition is an iterative refinement strategy featuring a small vertex separator.

  Abstract    
 Twin-width (tww) is a parameter measuring the similarity of an undirected graph to a co-graph [Édouard Bonnet et al., 2022]. It is useful to analyze the parameterized complexity of various graph problems. This paper presents two algorithms to compute the twin-width and to provide a contraction sequence as witness. The two algorithms are motivated by the PACE 2023 challenge, one for the exact track and one for the heuristic track. Each algorithm produces a contraction sequence witnessing (i) the minimal twin-width admissible by the graph in the exact track (ii) an upper bound on the twin-width as tight as possible in the heuristic track. Our heuristic algorithm relies on several greedy approaches with different performance characteristics to find and improve solutions. For large graphs we use locality sensitive hashing to approximately identify suitable contraction candidates. The exact solver follows a branch-and-bound design. It relies on the heuristic algorithm to provide initial upper bounds, and uses lower bounds via contraction sequences to show the optimality of a heuristic solution found in some branch.

  Abstract    
 The graph parameter twin-width was recently introduced by Bonnet et al. Twin-width is a parameter that measures a graph’s similarity to a cograph, which is a graph that can be reduced to a single vertex by repeatedly contracting twins. This brief description introduces Zygosity, a heuristic for computing a low-width contraction sequence that achieved second place in the 2023 edition of Parameterized Algorithms and Computational Experiments Challenge (PACE). Zygosity starts by repeatedly contracting twins. Then, any attached trees are contracted down to a single pendant vertex. The remaining graph is then contracted using a randomized greedy algorithm.

 Conference  
 Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their work at the symposium, and to incorporate the comments from the program committee. The conference proceedings will be published in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics ( LIPIcs  ) series after the conference.  
 Submission Guidelines  
 Authors are invited to submit an anonymized extended abstract, which should contain a summary of the main results, their motivation and importance, and evidence of their correctness. The authors should take particular notice that the extended abstract presents their work in a comprehensible and self-contained way. The quality of the presentation in the extended abstract will be taken into account by the program committee.  
 The conference employs a lightweight double-blind reviewing  process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work is in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, references should not be omitted or anonymized.  
 Authors must submit their papers electronically via EasyChair  . Papers must be formatted in LIPIcs style  ; no changes to font size, page margins, etc., are permitted. Line numbers must be activated. There is no page limit for the submission, but the PC may only look at the first 10 pages, so make sure the most important information appears early. Results previously published in conference proceedings or a journal (or scheduled for publication prior to IPEC) will not be considered.  
 Authors are encouraged to make the full, de-anonymized versions of their submissions freely accessible in an online repository such as arXiv  or ECCC  . Program committee members (except the co-chairs) are allowed to submit papers.  
 Final submission guidelines:  The final submission will be made in LIPIcs format, with a higher page limit of 15 pages plus bibliography (no appendix). More details will follow from LIPIcs upon acceptance. The submissions will be published as post-proceedings.
