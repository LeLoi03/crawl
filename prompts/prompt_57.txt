  The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2023   
 Sun Jun 18th through Thu the 22nd  
  at the Vancouver Convention Center  
 firstback   
 The IEEE / CVF Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference (CVPR)  is the premier annual computer vision event comprising the main conference and several co-located workshops and short courses. This year, CVPR will be single track such that everyone (with full passport registration) can attend everything. The focus will be on few selected plenary talks, scientific discussions at poster sessions and plenty of time for networking and socializing. Each paper will be presented at a poster session. All paper award candidates will have a plenary oral talk. Every attendee will have access to a personalized digital program. The virtual platform will host videos, posters and a chat room for every paper. All plenary events will be streamed!

 CVPR 2023 Visas  
 The CVPR'23 organizing committee deeply regrets that many members of our community could not receive visas to attend CVPR 2023. For several months, the organizers have actively raised concerns with Canadian immigration authorities (IRCC), government agencies, and politicians. In some cases, we have been successful in helping people obtain visas, but in many cases, our efforts were unsuccessful. The organizers acknowledge that the international representation of members from all over the world is what has made CVPR successful. We share in the frustration of those who were unable to attend. We continue to allow virtual to in-person registration switches for attendees who receive their visas before the conference.  
 Russian Invasion of Ukraine  
 CVPR condemns in the strongest possible terms the actions of the Russian Federation government in invading the sovereign state of Ukraine and engaging in war against the Ukrainian people. We express our solidarity and support for the people of Ukraine and for all those who have been adversely affected by this war.  
 Warning About Attendee List / Hotel Vendor Scams  
 The IEEE/CVF CVPR Conference does not sell or rent its attendee list. Please forward all attendee list solicitations to Carmen Saliba < csaliba@computer.org  >. Furthermore, we strongly encourage you to book your rooms through the event room block or directly with a reputable hotel to avoid hotel vendor scams.
