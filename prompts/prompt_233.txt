 Areas of Interest  
 AI Impact Track  
 PRICAI-2023 will feature an AI Impact track, and invites researchers, developers, entrepreneurs, emerging startups and organisations that focus on AI solutions for real world products and services, to share experiences and insights with academic experts and other industry focused researchers.  AI-Impact track solicits regular and short papers. Regular papers may consist up to 12 pages (including references), while short papers may consist up to 6 pages (including references). Paper to be written in single column. Accepted papers will be included in the PRICAI-2023 Proceedings. See Call for AI Impact Track  for more details.   
 Paper Submission  
 PRICAI reviewing is double blind, i.e., the authors do not know the names of the reviewers, and the reviewers cannot infer the names of the authors from the submission. The authors should avoid providing information that may identify themselves in any part of the submission. Violation of this guideline may lead to rejection without review. See Submission  for more details.  
 Call for Workshop and Tutorial Proposal  
 The PRICAI-2023 organizers also invite workshop and tutorial proposals in the all areas of Artificial Intelligence in various topics. See Call for Workshop  and Call for Tutorials  for more details.
