 Proceedings of the International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM) (16th, Bengaluru, India, July 11-14, 2023)

 International Educational Data Mining Society    
 The Indian Institute of Science is proud to host the fully in-person sixteenth iteration of the International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM) during July 11-14, 2023. EDM is the annual flagship conference of the International Educational Data Mining Society. The theme of this year's conference is "Educational data mining for amplifying human potential." Not all students or seekers of knowledge receive the education necessary to help them realize their full potential, be it due to a lack of resources or lack of access to high quality teaching. The dearth in high-quality educational content, teaching aids, and methodologies, and non-availability of objective feedback on how they could become better teachers, deprive our teachers from achieving their full potential. The administrators and policy makers lack tools for making optimal decisions such as optimal class sizes, class composition, and course sequencing. All these handicap the nations, particularly the economically emergent ones, who recognize the centrality of education for their growth. EDM-2023 has striven to focus on concepts, principles, and techniques mined from educational data for amplifying the potential of all the stakeholders in the education system. The spotlights of EDM-2023 include: (1) Five keynote talks by outstanding researchers of eminence; (2) A plenary Test of Time award talk and a Banquet talk; (3) Five tutorials (foundational as well as advanced); (4) Four thought provoking panels on contemporary themes; (5) Peer reviewed technical paper and poster presentations; (6) Doctoral students consortium; and (7) An enchanting cultural programme.

Item           A GPU-based Out-of-core Architecture for Interactive Visualization of AMR Time Series Data  ( The Eurographics Association  ,  2023  ) Alexandre-Barff, Welcome  ;   Deleau, Hervé  ;   Sarton, Jonathan  ;   Ledoux, Franck  ;   Lucas, Laurent  ;   Bujack, Roxana  ;   Pugmire, David  ;   Reina, Guido      Show more      This paper presents a scalable approach for large-scale Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) time series interactive visualization. We can define AMR data as a dynamic gridding format of cells hierarchically refined from a computational domain described in this study as a regular Cartesian grid. This adaptive feature is essential for tracking time-dependent evolutionary phenomena and makes the AMR format an essential representation for 3D numerical simulations. However, the visualization of numerical simulation data highlights one critical issue: the significant increases in generated data memory footprint reaching petabytes, thus greatly exceeding the memory capabilities of the most recent graphics hardware. Therefore, the question is how to access this massive data - AMR time series in particular - for interactive visualization on a simple workstation. To overcome this main problem, we present an out-of-core GPU-based architecture. Our proposal is a cache system based on an ad-hoc bricking identified by a Space-Filling Curve (SFC) indexing and managed by a GPU-based page table that loads required AMR data on-the-fly from disk to GPU memory.

Item           Efficient Sphere Rendering Revisited  ( The Eurographics Association  ,  2023  ) Gralka, Patrick  ;   Reina, Guido  ;   Ertl, Thomas  ;   Bujack, Roxana  ;   Pugmire, David  ;   Reina, Guido      Show more      Glyphs are an intuitive way of displaying the results of atomistic simulations, usually as spheres. Raycasting of camera-aligned billboards is considered the state-of-the-art technique to render large sets of spheres in a rasterization-based pipeline since the approach was first proposed by Gumhold. Over time various acceleration techniques have been proposed, such as the rendering of point primitives as billboards, which are trivial to rasterize and avoid a high workload in the vertex pipeline. Other techniques attempt to optimize data upload and access patterns in shader programs, both relevant aspects for dynamic data. Recent advances in graphics hardware raise the question of whether these optimizations are still valid. We evaluate several rendering and data access scheme combinations on real-world datasets and derive recommendations for efficient rasterization-based sphere rendering.    Show more

When the complexity of the pipelines to be created increases, additional techniques are needed to ensure that reasoning about the pipelines structure and its performance remains feasible. This paper presents three additions to ParaView with the goal of improving presentation of complex, parallel pipelines benefiting pipeline realization. More specifically, we provide a runtime performance annotation visualization integrated in a visual programming node editor, allowing all users to reason about basic performance and intuitively manipulate the structure and configuration of pipelines. Further, we extend the list of available filters with control flow filters, supporting for- and while-loops with a comprehensible representation in the node editor. Our extension is based on graphical manipulation of a node graph that expresses the flow of data and computation in a VTK pipeline, and draws upon a long tradition and positive experience with similar interfaces across a wide range of software systems such as the visualization tools SCIRun and VTK Designer, or the rendering systems Blender and Houdini. The extension we provide integrates seamlessly into the existing ParaView architecture as a plug-in, i.e., it does not require any modifications to ParaView itself or VTK's execution model.

  Overview  
 EICS 2023 is the fifteenth international ACM SIGCHI conference devoted to engineering interactive computing systems and their user interfaces, addressing one or more software quality factors, such as usability, user experience, reliability, security, etc.  
 Work presented at EICS covers all stages of the engineering life-cycle of interactive systems - inception, requirements, design, specification, coding, data analytics, validation and verification, deployment and maintenance. EICS has the longest tradition of bringing together researchers who contribute to better ways of creating interactive computing systems, stemming from the conference on command languages in the seventies. The conference is best known for rigorously contributing and disseminating research results that hold the midst in between user interface design, software engineering and computational interaction.  
 EICS focuses on models, languages, notations, methods, techniques and tools that support designing, developing, validating and verifying interactive systems. The conference brings together people who study or practice the engineering of interactive systems, drawing from design, HCI, software engineering, requirements engineering, software development, modeling, and programming. Submissions advance the state of the art of the engineering of interactive systems.
