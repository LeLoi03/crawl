  We present a `user-friendly’ introduction to randomized matrix algorithms, with several case studies that focus on the ideas and intuition behind randomization.  
 The concerted development of randomized matrix algorithms started in the theoretical Computer Science community in the nineteen-nineties. At first a purely theoretical enterprise, these algorithms have become practical to the point that they are being used by domain scientists; and general purpose software libraries, such as RandBLAS and RandLAPACK, are under development.  
 Many randomized matrix algorithms reduce the problem dimension by replacing the original matrix with a lower-dimensional ‘sketch’. We illustrate this on the basic problem of matrix multiplication, and on the solution of least squares/regression problems. Along the way, we discuss sampling modalities (data-aware, oblivious), developments in high-dimensional probability (matrix concentration inequalities, matrix coherence), numerical issues (problem conditioning), and the analysis of the error due to randomization.  
 This talk draws on work with current and former students Jocelyn Chi, John Holodnak, Arnel Smith, and Thomas Wentworth.  
 ICIAM Maxwell Prize Lecture  
  Spectral Approaches to Complex Dynamics   
  Abstract:  
  The weather and the climate, along with social processes, biological processes, and engineering processes, are all dynamical systems because they are governed by a set of micro-rules at the level of individual states that describe how processes evolve over time. Complex dynamical systems incorporate elements of unpredictability (nearby initial states quickly diverge from one another) and emergence (macroscopic system behaviour is not apparent from the set of micro-rules due to many interacting components).  
 Emergent behaviour in complex dynamical systems is typically connected with the appearance of macro-structures that persist for a certain amount of time. Examples of such macro-structures include eddies in the ocean, cyclonic storms or heatwaves in the atmosphere, and the coalescing of societal opinion around a particular issue. It is these macro-phenomena that impact our daily world, but it remains challenging to identify key organising emergent phenomena from micro-rules or spatiotemporal observations. Part of the difficulty arises from the usually complicated nonlinear dynamics of the micro-rules. To access these macro-phenomena, we use a linear operator induced by the micro-dynamics. This linear operator – the transfer operator – acts on ensembles of individual states, and its linearity enables one to access a huge toolbox from linear analysis.  
 In this talk, we gently introduce the transfer operator and its associated spectral theory. We also make connections to a dynamic spectral geometry of evolving manifolds, centred on the dynamic Laplace operator. Several example analyses are presented, ranging across problems in climate, physical oceanography, and atmospheric science.  
  The abstraction of the behavior of a system or a phenomenon into a consistent mathematical model is instrumental for a variety of applications in science and engineering. In the context of scientific discovery, a fundamental problem is to explain natural phenomena in a manner consistent with both (noisy) experimental data, and a body of (possibly inexact and incomplete) background knowledge about the laws of the universe.  
 Historically, models were manually derived in a first-principles deductive fashion. The first-principles approach often offers the derivation of interpretable symbolic models of remarkable levels of universality while being substantiated by little data. Nonetheless, derivation of such models is time-consuming and relies heavily upon domain expertise.  
  Conversely, with the rising pervasiveness of statistical AI and data-driven approaches, automated, rapid construction and deployment of models has become a reality. Many data-driven modeling techniques demonstrate remarkable scalability due to their reliance upon predetermined, exploitable model form (functional form) structures. Such structures, entail non-interpretable models, demand Big Data for training, and provide limited predictive power for out-of-set instances.  
 In this talk, we will review some of the recent transformations in the field, and the ongoing attempts to bridge the divide between statistical AI and symbolic AI. We will begin by discussing algorithms that can search for free-form symbolic models, where neither the structure nor the set of operator primitives is predetermined. We will proceed in reviewing innovations in the field of automated theorem proving (ATP) machinery, and discuss how ATPs can be harnessed to certify whether a candidate hypothesis model is conforming with background theory. Lastly, we shall discuss efforts to consistently unify the two approaches.  
 These endeavors will promote the conceptualization of AI algorithms capable of making the discovery of principled, universal, and meaningful symbolic models, using small data and incomplete background theory. With some optimism, some of these discoveries, can unveil to us the secrets of the universe.  
  Aggregation-Diffusion Equations for Collective Behaviour in the Sciences   
  Abstract:  
  Many phenomena in the life sciences, ranging from the microscopic to macroscopic level, exhibit surprisingly similar structures. Behaviour at the microscopic level, including ion channel transport, chemotaxis, and angiogenesis, and behaviour at the macroscopic level, including herding of animal populations, motion of human crowds, and bacteria orientation, are both largely driven by long-range attractive forces, due to electrical, chemical or social interactions, and short-range repulsion, due to dissipation or finite size effects.  
 Various modelling approaches at the agent-based level, from cellular automata to Brownian particles, have been used to describe these phenomena. An alternative way to pass from microscopic models to continuum descriptions requires the analysis of the mean-field limit, as the number of agents becomes large. All these approaches lead to a continuum kinematic equation for the evolution of the density of individuals known as the aggregation-diffusion equation. This equation models the evolution of the density of individuals of a population, that move driven by the balances of forces: on one hand, the diffusive term models diffusion of the population, where individuals escape high concentration of individuals, and on the other hand, the aggregation forces due to the drifts modelling attraction/repulsion at a distance.  
 The aggregation-diffusion equation can also be understood as the steepest-descent curve (gradient flow) of free energies coming from statistical physics. Significant effort has been devoted to the subtle mechanism of balance between aggregation and diffusion. In some extreme cases, the minimisation of the free energy leads to partial concentration of the mass.  
 Aggregation-diffusion equations are present in a wealth of applications across science and engineering. Of particular relevance is mathematical biology, with an emphasis on cell population models. The aggregation terms, either in scalar or in system form, is often used to model the motion of cells as they concentrate or separate from a target or interact through chemical cues. The diffusion effects described above are consistent with population pressure effects, whereby groups of cells naturally spread away from areas of high concentration.

  Public Lecture 1 on Aug. 20  
 Meiji Institute for Advanced Study of Mathematical Science, Meiji University  
 Abstract  
 Founders of TOYOTA dreamed “Flying Nimbus” that is a magical flying cloud in Chinese classic literature “Journey to the West, Saiyuki.” When I was told about this look-like very childish dream by Dr. Shoichiro Toyoda at the visit to Toyota Central R&D Laboratories while I was working in University of Michigan, I was so impressed by the dream that he storied through Flying Nimbus. It is a sustainable safe and feel safe vehicle made from water and air! Dr. Toyoda asked me to lead advanced research for Flying Nimbus with extremely charming smile. Researchers must be realistic, but they are so dreamy, too.  
 In this talk, various struggling stories would be presented with so many failing so few successful trials to implement this notion in real vehicles applying all possible science and technology, especially computer related applied mathematics. Through this dreamy venture, we have leaned enormous difference between safety and feel safety together with clear distinction between personal and social acceptance. Applied mathematics, especially computer related science and technology including artificial intelligence, would be a key potential remedy to close the gaps mentioned.

 The Possibilities of Origami: Art, Mathematics, and Applications in Engineering  
 Abstract  
 Origami is a traditional art form of Japan with a rich history. Simple and beautiful creations such as the origami crane and paper boat are iconic symbols of this art. However, origami is not only admired for its beauty but also for its complexity and mathematical aspects. Furthermore, the folding characteristic of origami proves to be a functional feature in engineering, making it promising for industrial applications. In this lecture, the historical background of origami will be explored, and the speaker will explain how it is intricately connected with mathematics and how it’s being applied in various industries. Additionally, we will discuss the evolution of origami design through the utilization of computers. The speaker will introduce the techniques they have developed for creating shapes with curved surfaces and at the end of the lecture, participants will have the opportunity to experience folding origami using curves.

 ICIAM Prizes Recipients and Invited Lecturers   
 2023 ICIAM Prizes: recipients and committees  
 The 2023 ICIAM prizes will be awarded at the Opening Ceremony of the International Congress for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, ICIAM 2023, to be held in Tokyo (Japan), on August 20-25, 2023. The Prize Committee was chaired by Ya-xiang Yuan, the President of ICIAM. Other members were:  
 Gang Bao (Chair of Maxwell Prize Subcommittee). 
  Alfredo Bermudez (Chair of Pioneer Prize Subcommittee). 
  ICIAM Collatz Prize  
 The 2023 ICIAM Collatz Prize is awarded to Maria Colombo (EPFL Lausanne, Switzerland) for her fundamental contributions to the regularity theory and the analysis of singularities in elliptic PDEs, geometric variational problems, transport equations, and incompressible fluid dynamics.  
  ICIAM Su Buchin Prize  
 The 2023 ICIAM Su Buchin Prize is awarded to Jose Mario Martinez Perez (University of Campinas, Brazil) for outstanding achievements in research—a combination of theory, practice, software, and applications for solving large-scale optimization problems—and in fostering the development of the optimization and applied mathematics communities in Latin America.  
  Precious Sibanda (University of Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa). 
  Pingwen Zhang (Peking University, China). 
  ICIAM Industry Prize 2023  
 Awarded to Cleve B. Moler for his outstanding contributions to the development of mathematical and computational tools and methods for the solution of science and engineering problems and his invention of MATLAB, which allows industrial users to harness efficient and reliable numerical methods to execute numerical simulations in ever-expanding domains of science and engineering.  
  Meiji University’s Institute of Autonomous Driving(MIAD), Emeritus Professor of Tokyo Institute of Technology, Member of Science Council of Japan(SCJ).  
 His title for the invited lecture in ICIAM 2023 is “Mathematical sciences for realization of origami engineering aided land / sea / air self-driving car with intelligence”. The lecture will consist of origami engineering, machine learning, optimal control and control of plural eigenfrequencies. In origami engineering, it will be shown the most splendid Japanese Kirigami honeycomb which receives very much attention because it is the best treasure trove to produce metamaterials. As far as machine learning, it will be shown his own technology FQHNN(Fuzzy Quantification method aided Holographic Neural Network) which has causal information unlike CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) which leads the third generation of machine learning. And in optimal control, it will be shown also his own method which is only one real-time optimal control method. The so-called optimal control is not used in the real car because Pontryagin’s maximum principle gives the nonlinear equation which cannot be solved in real time. He has noticed the analogy of the new optimal control theory and the nature of the solution of parabolic equations for the first time and this has contributed to pass this problem. As far as control of plural eigenfrequencies, it is very difficult to be applied the conventional topology optimization. He has developed a new high speed and high accuracy topology change method for ride quality improvement and elimination of anxiety due to the absence of the driver in the self-driving car from observations of strain and dynamic energy distributions of each eigen frequency mode. He is mobilizing with his lab members all of these technologies to successfully create an origami engineering aided land / sea / air self-driving car with intelligence. Here he will discuss the mathematical backbones for these techniques which successfully develop the dream land / sea / air self-driving car with intelligence.

 Calls for Minisymposia, Contributed Talks, Posters and Others   
 To ensure balance, ICIAM 2023 prefers that a single individual not be the organizer of more than one minisymposium. In addition, ICIAM 2023 discourages minisymposia in which most of the speakers come from the same organization or if all co-authors on the papers being presented in a minisymposium are from the same organization.  
 Important Dates  
 All deadlines are at midnight AoE (Anywhere on Earth).  
 Submissions open on April 1, 2022 
  Closing date for submissions of proposals: | December 23, 2022 | February 20, 2023

  Registration fees for speakers are due on July 20, 2023 (Speakers who have not registered at that date will have their talks removed from the program.) 
  The schedule of minisymposia is planned to be made available from May – June, 2023.  
 Important Notices  
 Limitation of the number of talks by each participant: Each participant is limited to presenting at most one talk during the congress (ICIAM 2023), including talks in contributed talks, this is in order to provide the opportunity for everyone to present their research. Note that talks in industrial minisymposia and industrial contributed talks as well as invited talks are excluded from this limitation. If you are invited to speak in more than one minisymposium, we suggest you use the opportunity to nominate a colleague or student to speak about your work. 
  Conference format: In principle, ICIAM 2023 will be held in a hybrid conference format, i.e., a session in a minisymposium may mix on-site and online talks. If the situation demands, we will switch the conference format to an online format. Even if that is the case, ICIAM 2023 will not reimburse any expenses including travel expenses and hotel charges of participants. 
  Registration fee refunds: See “ | Cancellation and Refund Policy | ”. 
  No exemption from payment of registration fee: ICIAM 2023 will not be able to waive the registration fee for minisymposium organizers and speakers, or reimburse their expenses. Therefore, minisymposium organizers should make no financial commitments on behalf of ICIAM 2023 when organizing their minisymposium. 
  Submission  
 Proposals for ICIAM 2023 minisymposia can be submitted via here   .  
 Organizing a Minisymposium  
 Those interested in organizing a minisymposium should submit a proposal to the Local Scientific Program Committee by no later than the due date.

Organizers are especially encouraged to include speakers from more than one country and from underrepresented groups, including women and minorities, whenever appropriate.  
 A minisymposium may have up to four organizers, who can also be speakers, and chair the sessions. In conducting the minisymposium, one of the session organizers should provide an overview of the minisymposium, introduce the speakers, and provide an opportunity for discussion among the speakers and the audience.  
 Prospective minisymposium organizers should seriously consider the following recommendations when selecting speakers in a minisymposium:  
  Minisymposium organizers should select the first speaker who can provide an overview of the topic area, put the whole area in perspective, particularly regarding applications, and suggest new venues for sustainable research and applications. It is recommended that one of the minisymposium organizers becomes the first speaker. 
  Guidelines for Preparing a Minisymposium Proposal  
 Only one of the minisymposium organizers will be the contact person with the organization. The contact person should fill out the online submission form and provide the following information:  
 Contact person: Provide full name, title, affiliation, address, and e-mail address. All correspondence regarding the minisymposium will be sent to the e-mail address of the contact person.
