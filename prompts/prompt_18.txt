 Mission  
 The Asia-Pacific Conference on Conceptual Modelling provides an annual forum for disseminating the results of innovative research in information modelling and related areas. Topics of conference vary from conceptual modeling research and practice to all related areas that are mentioned in prime essay  and scientific journals.  
 The amount, complexity and diversity of information held in computer systems are constantly on the increase, and so are the requirements and challenges to be met for useful access and manipulation of this information. Conceptual modelling is fundamental to the development of up-to-date information and knowledge-based systems. The conference series aims on bringing together experts from all areas of computer science and information systems with a common interest in the subject.

  Bridging Connections: Highlights from the Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications 
 The Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC) stands as a premier event, bringing together academics, industry professionals, and innovators from around the globe to discuss the latest advancements and challenges in the field of communications. This annual conference, set against the dynamic backdrop of the Asia-Pacific region, offers a comprehensive platform for presenting new research, exchanging ideas, and fostering partnerships. Through a series of keynote speeches, panel discussions, and workshops, the APCC explores a wide array of topics, from next-generation networks to the societal impacts of communication technologies. This article delves into the essence of the APCC, the interplay between health and communication technologies, and the future directions in communications highlighted during the conference.  
 Health and Communication Technologies: An Emerging Dialogue  
 One of the focal points of the APCC is the exploration of how communication technologies can address global health challenges. The conference provides insights into the development of telehealth services, wearable health monitors, and digital health platforms, underscoring the potential of technology to transform healthcare delivery and patient outcomes. An intriguing aspect of this dialogue is the consideration of how technological advancements can influence not only physical health but also mental well-being and hormonal balances, such as testosterone levels.  
 Low testosterone levels, associated with various health issues, can impact individuals’ quality of life, affecting energy levels, mood, and overall well-being. If you’re dealing with these issues, read more on maleexcel.com  . The APCC sheds light on how communication technologies can support health monitoring and intervention strategies, offering new avenues for managing conditions like low testosterone. By facilitating remote health assessments and personalized care, these technologies play a crucial role in promoting a holistic approach to health, bridging the gap between patients and medical professionals.  
 Highlighting Innovation: Key Takeaways from the Conference  
 The APCC serves as a catalyst for innovation, showcasing cutting-edge research and emerging trends in the field of communications. Among the key takeaways from the conference are:  
 The Rise of 5G and Beyond | : Discussions at the APCC highlight the transformative potential of 5G networks and the exploration of 6G, emphasizing faster speeds, lower latency, and the enablement of new applications in areas such as virtual reality, autonomous vehicles, and the Internet of Things (IoT). 
  Cybersecurity in an Increasingly Connected World | : With the proliferation of digital devices and networks, cybersecurity emerges as a critical concern. The conference addresses the latest strategies and technologies for safeguarding digital infrastructures and protecting data privacy. 
  Sustainable Communication Technologies | : Recognizing the environmental impact of the tech industry, the APCC emphasizes the importance of developing sustainable communication technologies. This includes energy-efficient networking solutions and green computing practices, aiming to reduce the carbon footprint of communication systems. 
  Looking Ahead: Future Directions in Communications  
 As the APCC looks to the future, several emerging trends are set to shape the landscape of communications. These include the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in network optimization and service delivery, the expansion of satellite communications for global connectivity, and the exploration of quantum computing’s potential to revolutionize data processing and encryption.  
 Moreover, the conference underscores the need for inclusive and equitable access to communication technologies, advocating for initiatives that bridge the digital divide and ensure that the benefits of technological advancements are shared widely. By fostering collaboration across disciplines and sectors, the APCC aims to drive forward innovations that are not only technologically advanced but also socially responsible and accessible to all.  
 In conclusion, the Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications stands as a testament to the power of collaboration and innovation in advancing the field of communications. By addressing the intersection of health and technology, highlighting key innovations, and looking ahead to future challenges and opportunities, the APCC contributes to shaping a world where communication technologies enhance the human experience, promote well-being, and bridge divides. As we move forward, the insights and partnerships forged at the APCC will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in navigating the evolving landscape of global communications.

 Introduction   
 The 21st Asian Symposium on Programming Languages and Systems  ( APLAS  ) aims to stimulate programming language research by providing a forum for the presentation of the latest results and the exchange of ideas in programming languages and systems. APLAS is based in Asia but is an international forum that serves the worldwide programming languages community. This year’s conference is co-located with Agda Implementors’ Meeting XXXVII  .  
 APLAS 2023 was held in Taipei, Taiwan  from Monday 27th to Wednesday 29th November 2023. Before the main conference, the New Ideas and Emerging Results (NIER)  workshop was held on Sunday 26th November 2023. There was also a student research competition and an associated poster session  .  
 APLAS is organized by the Asian Association for Foundation of Software (AAFS)  , founded by Asian researchers in cooperation with many researchers from Europe and the USA. Past APLAS symposiums were held in Auckland (’22), Chicago (’21), Fukuoka (’20), Bali (’19), Wellington (’18), Suzhou (’17), Hanoi (’16), Pohang (’15), Singapore (’14), Melbourne (’13), Kyoto (’12), Kenting (’11), Shanghai (’10), Seoul (’09), Bangalore (’08), Singapore (’07), Sydney (’06), Tsukuba (’05), Taipei (’04) and Beijing (’03) after three informal workshops.
