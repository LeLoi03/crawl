 IEEE Symposium on Adaptive Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning (IEEE ADPRL)  
 Adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) and reinforcement learning (RL) are two related paradigms for solving decision making problems where a performance index must be optimized over time. ADP and RL methods are enjoying a growing popularity and success in applications, fueled by their ability to deal with general and complex problems, including features such as uncertainty, stochastic effects, and nonlinearity.

 Academic research in the field of autonomous vehicles has reached high popularity in recent years related to several topics as sensor technologies, V2X communications, safety, security, decision making, control, and even legal and standardization rules. Besides classic control design approaches, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning methods are present in almost all of these fields. Another part of research focuses on different layers of Motion Planning, such as strategic decisions, trajectory planning, and control. A wide range of techniques in Machine Learning itself have been developed, and this article describes one of these fields, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The paper provides insight into the hierarchical motion planning problem and describes the basics of DRL. The main elements of designing such a system are the modeling of the environment, the modeling abstractions, the description of the state and the perception models, the appropriate rewarding, and the realization of the underlying neural network. The paper describes vehicle models, simulation possibilities and computational requirements. Strategic decisions on different layers and the observation models, e.g., continuous and discrete state representations, grid-based, and camera-based solutions are presented. The paper surveys the state-of-art solutions systematized by the different tasks and levels of autonomous driving, such as car-following, lane-keeping, trajectory following, merging, or driving in dense traffic. Finally, open questions and future challenges are discussed.

 The idea of optimization can be regarded as an important basis of many disciplines and hence is extremely useful for a large number of research fields, particularly for artificial-intelligence-based advanced control design. Due to the difficulty of solving optimal control problems for general nonlinear systems, it is necessary to establish a kind of novel learning strategies with intelligent components. Besides, the rapid development of computer and networked techniques promotes the research on optimal control within discrete-time domain. In this paper, the bases, the derivation, and recent progresses of critic intelligence for discrete-time advanced optimal control design are presented with an emphasis on the iterative framework. Among them, the so-called critic intelligence methodology is highlighted, which integrates learning approximators and the reinforcement formulation.

 The core task of tracking control is to make the controlled plant track a desired trajectory. The traditional performance index used in previous studies cannot eliminate completely the tracking error as the number of time steps increases. In this paper, a new cost function is introduced to develop the value-iteration-based adaptive critic framework to solve the tracking control problem. Unlike the regulator problem, the iterative value function of tracking control problem cannot be regarded as a Lyapunov function. A novel stability analysis method is developed to guarantee that the tracking error converges to zero. The discounted iterative scheme under the new cost function for the special case of linear systems is elaborated. Finally, the tracking performance of the present scheme is demonstrated by numerical results and compared with those of the traditional approaches.

  This paper proposed a data-driven adaptive optimal control approach for CVCF (constant voltage, constant frequency) inverter based on reinforcement learning and adaptive dynamic programming (ADP). Different from existing literature, the load is treated as a dynamic uncertainty and a robust optimal state-feedback controller is proposed. The stability of the inverter-load system has been strictly ... [Show full abstract]  analyzed. In order to obtain accurate output current differential signal, this paper designs a tracking differentiator. It is ensured that the tracking error asymptotically converges to zero through the proposed output-feedback controllers. A standard proportional integral controller and linear active disturbance rejection control strategy are also designed for the purpose of comparison. The simulation results show that the proposed controller has inherent robustness and does not require retuning with different applications.

  This paper is concerned with a new discrete-time policy iteration adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) method for solving the infinite horizon optimal control problem of nonlinear systems. The idea is to use an iterative ADP technique to obtain the iterative control law, which optimizes the iterative performance index function. The main contribution of this paper is to analyze the convergence and ... [Show full abstract]  stability properties of policy iteration method for discrete-time nonlinear systems for the first time. It shows that the iterative performance index function is nonincreasingly convergent to the optimal solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. It is also proven that any of the iterative control laws can stabilize the nonlinear systems. Neural networks are used to approximate the performance index function and compute the optimal control law, respectively, for facilitating the implementation of the iterative ADP algorithm, where the convergence of the weight matrices is analyzed. Finally, the numerical results and analysis are presented to illustrate the performance of the developed method.

  This paper is concerned with a novel integrated multi-step heuristic dynamic programming (MsHDP) algorithm for solving optimal control problems. It is shown that, initialized by the zero cost function, MsHDP can converge to the optimal solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Then, the stability of the system is analyzed using control policies generated by MsHDP.Also, a general ... [Show full abstract]  stability criterion is designed to determine the admissibility of the current control policy. That is, the criterion is applicable not only to traditional value iteration and policy iteration but also to MsHDP. Further, based on the convergence and the stability criterion, the integrated MsHDP algorithm using immature control policies is developed to accelerate learning efficiency greatly. Besides, actor-critic is utilized to implement the integrated MsHDP scheme, where neural networks are used to evaluate and improve the iterative policy as the parameter architecture. Finally, two simulation examples are given to demonstrate that the learning effectiveness of the integrated MsHDP scheme surpasses those of other fixed or integrated methods.
