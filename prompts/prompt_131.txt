  Scope:A new and disruptive paradigm spear-headed by academics and industry experts is taking shape so that applications can leverage resources located at the edge of the network and along the continuum between the cloud and the edge. The Fog/Edge computing paradigm is expected to improve the agility of service deployments, make use of opportunistic and cheap computing, and leverage the network latency and bandwidth diversities between these resources. Numerous challenges arise when using edge resources, which requires the re-examination of operating systems, virtualization and containers, and middleware techniques for fabric management. The conference seeks to attract high-quality contributions covering both theory and practice over system software and domain-specific applications related to next-generation distributed systems that use the edge.

 Title:  Separation of Concerns for Complexity Mitigation in System and Domain Formal Modelling – A Dive into Algebraic Event-B Theories  
 Abstract:   
 Formal methods have shown their ability and efficiency in the design, analysis and verification of safety critical complex software systems. A crucial challenge for formal methods nowadays is to make them reasonably accessible, as to foster a wider adoption across system engineering, and make their implementation and deployment more operational for non-expert engineers and researchers alike. From our point of view, promoting the reuse and sharing of explicitly formalised elements such as models, theories, proofs, etc. contributes, undoubtedly, to the dissemination of these methods. As a result, reuse mechanisms must be defined and integrated into development processes such as refinement, abstraction, composition/decomposition, etc.  
 In this talk, we will discuss state -based formal methods, namely the Event-B method. We report on our findings about the definition of algebraic theories that are utilised within Event-B model refinement chains. In our method, Event-B models borrow operators, axioms, theorems, proof and rewrite rules from these theories. Relying on their well-definedness, these operators, axioms, theorems and proof and rewrite rules are useful to discharge the proof obligations generated for these models, and contribute to reducing development efforts, as theorems of the theories are proved once and for all. The approach is illustrated on the generation of new proof obligations and on system models conformance to engineering standards.

 Journal-First Presentations  
 ICFEM 2023 is inviting journal-first presentations of papers published recently in the following journals:  
 ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems 
  Theoretical Computer Science 
 The presentations will offer the authors an opportunity to speak directly to their peers in the community, and also enrich the ICFEM program. The journal-first presentation will be listed in the conference program, yet the corresponding papers will not be part of the ICFEM proceedings as they have been published through the journals. At least one author of each accepted journal-first presentation must register for and attend the ICFEM conference to present the paper.  
  Evaluation and Selection  
 A journal-first presentation submitted to ICFEM must adhere to the following criteria:  
 The journal paper is in the scope of ICFEM 2023. 
  The paper was accepted by one of the participating journals no earlier than January 1, 2022. 
  The paper reports completely new research results or presents novel contributions that were not previously reported in prior work. 
  The paper does not extend prior work solely with additional proofs or algorithms, additional empirical results, or minor enhancements or variants of the results presented in the prior work. 
  The paper has not been presented at, and is not under consideration for, journal-first programs of other conferences. 
 Each submission will be evaluated according to these criteria. In case that the number of submissions is higher than expected, eligible submissions may be selected to be presented at the conference, and priority will be given to the papers that best fit the conference program.  
  How to Submit  
 Interested authors should submit a short presentation proposal consisting of the paper title, abstract, a short statement on how the work satisfies the above criteria, and the PDF of the original journal paper. Please submit a single PDF file and list all authors of the original journal paper as authors in EasyChair. No special formatting is required.

 Doctoral Symposium Paper Submission  
 The ICFEM Doctoral Symposium is an international forum for PhD students studying all areas related to formal methods for software, hardware and system development. This forum is an excellent opportunity bringing together PhD students and well-known established researchers from the formal methods community. It will also provide PhD students with fruitful feedback and advice on their research approach and enable them to interact with other PhD students in order to stimulate the exchange of ideas and the sharing of experiences among participants. In summary, the PhD forum will provide PhD students with an ideal opportunity to present, share and discuss their research in a constructive and critical scientific atmosphere.  
 We seek submissions from PhD students who have either determined the direction of their thesis research (probably with some preliminary results already published), but who still have substantial work to complete; or PhD student participants who are in the early stages of their dissertations. It is not required to have a paper accepted at the main conference in order to participate in the ICFEM Doctoral Symposium.  
 Submissions to the Doctoral Symposium should include: Title of the research, the author name (single name) and affiliation; Context and motivation; Problem statement and related work; Proposed solutions and current research efforts, their significance, methodology, results and analysis, and future work. The paper should be prepared using the LNCS format  and submitted in PDF format via EasyChair.  
 Authors with accepted submissions are expected to attend the Doctoral Symposium in person to present their work. A discounted registration fee for Doctoral Symposium participants will be announced later.

8. ICFP_1 conference:
International Conference on Functional Programming  
 ICFP (International Conference on Functional Programming)  is an annual programming language conference. It is sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery ( ACM  ) under the aegis of the ACM Special Interest Group on Programming Languages ( SIGPLAN  ), in association with Working Group 2.8 of the International Federation of Information Processing ( IFIP  ). ICFP combined two former biennial conferences: Functional Programming and Computer Architecture (FPCA)  and Lisp and Functional Programming (LFP)  .  
 ICFP  provides a forum for researchers and developers to hear about the latest work on the design, implementations, principles, and uses of functional programming. The conference covers the entire spectrum of work, from practice to theory, including its peripheries.  
 This page is designed to be a permanent home for information about, or relevant to, ICFP. As well as information about the conference itself, it contains pointers to journals, other conferences and workshops, and so on, that may be of interest. Please email suggestions for improvement to Sam Westrick  .  
 Scope  
 ICFP seeks original papers on the art and science of functional programming. Submissions are invited on all topics from principles to practice, from foundations to features, from abstraction to application. The scope includes all languages that encourage functional programming, including both purely applicative and imperative languages, as well as languages with objects or concurrency. Particular topics of interest include:  
 Language Design: | type systems; concurrency and distribution; modules; components and composition; metaprogramming; relations to object-oriented or logic programming; interoperability 
  Implementation: | abstract machines; compilation; compile-time and run-time optimization; memory management; multi-threading; exploiting parallel hardware; interfaces to foreign functions, services components or low-level machine resources 
  Applications and Domain-Specific Languages: | symbolic computing; formal-methods tools; artificial intelligence; systems programming; distributed-systems and web programming; hardware design; databases; XML processing; scientific and numerical computing; graphical user interfaces; multimedia programming; scripting; system administration; security; education 
  Functional Pearls: | elegant, instructive and fun essays on functional programming 
  The conference also solicits Experience Reports  , which are short papers that provide evidence that functional programming really works or describe obstacles that have kept it from working in a particular application.
