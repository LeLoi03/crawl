  CCS supports the EUSPN International Conference in Various Capacities  
 Feb 19 2024   
 The College of Computer Studies (CCS) supported and made marks at the 14th International Conference on Emerging Ubiquitous Systems and Pervasive Networks (EUSPN) in Almaty, Kazakhstan.  
  Dr. Roderick Tabalba, University of Hawaii at Manoa, United States 
  Dr. May Marie P. Talandron-Felipe, University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines Philippines 
  The team successfully conducted their roles by reviewing submitted papers and recommending the acceptance/rejection based on the submitted paper’s quality by aspiring researchers wishing to join the conference.  
 On the other hand, the undergraduate paper entitled: “Bundle AI: An Application of Multiple Constraint Knapsack Problem (MCKP) Through Genetic Algorithm” was accepted by the EUSPN conference under the Adaptive Systems, Intelligent Computing, and Applications (AISICA) Track. The authors are Angel Nicole Carloman, Urel Van William Bermudo, and Eires Marc Estilloso, all BS Computer Science students.  
 Meanwhile, a paper entitled “Vaccimon Device: A Design and Development of Vaccine Carrier Monitoring Device for COVID-19 Vaccines” is under review at the 13th International Conference on Current and Future Trends of Information and Communication Technologies in Healthcare (ICTH 2023), a collocated conference with EUSPN 2023. Even though the paper status is still under review, none of the five reviewers rejected the paper. The paper is part of the thesis output from a graduating MS Computer Applications student, Paul Harriet Asinero.  
 All the submitted papers are the product of the students with their mentor and adviser, Dr. Orven E. Llantos. With these contributions, it is expected that the CCS will increase the research productivity output while also showing the capacity of the CCS as a Program Chair in international conferences—the CCS way of influencing the future.

 Overview  
 Top Research Topics at European conference on Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial Optimization?  
  Evolutionary algorithm (29.21%) 
  European conference on Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial Optimization primarily focuses on research topics in Mathematical optimization, Evolutionary algorithm, Algorithm, Combinatorial optimization and Local search (optimization). The Mathematical optimization study featured in the event draws connections with the study of Benchmark (computing). Aside from discussions in Evolutionary algorithm, the event also deals with the subject of Multi-objective optimization which intersects with Pareto principle disciplines.  
 European conference on Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial Optimization features studies on Algorithm, including topics such as Travelling salesman problem. The studies in Combinatorial optimization featured incorporate elements of Theoretical computer science, Graph theory, Memetic algorithm, Solver and Search algorithm. While work presented in European conference on Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial Optimization provided substantial information on Local search (optimization), it also covered topics in Beam search, Best-first search and Vehicle routing problem.  
 It explores topics in Metaheuristic which can be helpful for research in disciplines like Ant colony optimization algorithms, Simulated annealing, Tabu search and Heuristic (computer science). The event addresses concerns in Genetic algorithm which are intertwined with other disciplines, such as Crossover and Artificial intelligence. The studies on Heuristics discussed can also contribute to research in the domains of Machine learning and Heuristic.  
 What are the most cited papers published at the conference?  
  Research areas of the most cited articles at European conference on Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial Optimization:  
 The conference articles mainly deal with areas of study such as Mathematical optimization, Evolutionary algorithm, Combinatorial optimization, Algorithm and Local search (optimization). The conference papers focus on Mathematical optimization as well as the interrelated topics of Vehicle routing problem. The most cited publications focus on Evolutionary algorithm but the discussions also offer insight into other areas such as Genetic algorithm, Multi-objective optimization, Heuristic (computer science) and Benchmark (computing).  
 What topics the last edition of the conference is best known for?  
  Mathematical optimization 
  The previous edition focused in particular on these issues:  
 European conference on Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial Optimization generally zeroes in on subjects such as Mathematical optimization, Heuristics, Evolutionary algorithm, Job shop scheduling and Algorithm. The studies tackled, which mainly focus on Mathematical optimization, apply to Benchmark (computing) as well. The research on Heuristics tackled can also make contributions to studies in the areas of Steiner tree problem and Heuristic.  
 The event focuses on Evolutionary algorithm but sometimes tackles the closely related topic of Mutation (genetic algorithm) which is concerned with Order (ring theory), Fitness function, Linear function (calculus), Arbitrarily large and Exponential function. The featured Job shop scheduling studies mainly concentrate on Heuristic (computer science) but also cover areas of interest in Simulated annealing, Linear programming and Ant colony optimization algorithms. The subject of Genetic programming, which is connected to the field of Algorithm configuration, serves as the foundation of the Algorithm research featured in the conference.  
 The most cited articles from the last conference are:  
 Stagnation Detection with Randomized Local Search (9 citations) 
  A Cooperative Optimization Approach for Distributing Service Points in Mobility Applications (2 citations) 
  Papers citation over time  
 A key indicator for each conference is its effectiveness in reaching other researchers with the papers published at that venue.

 Publication chance based on affiliation  
 The publication chance index shows the ratio of articles published by the best research institutions at the conference edition to all articles published within that conference. The best research institutions were selected based on the largest number of articles published during all editions of the conference.  
 Returning Authors Index  
 A very common phenomenon observed among researchers publishing scientific articles is the intentional selection of conferences they have already attended in the past. In particular, it is worth analyzing the case when the authors participate in the same conference from year to year.  
 The Returning Authors Index presented below illustrates the ratio of authors who participated in both a given as well as the previous edition of the conference in relation to all participants in a given year.

 Returning Institution Index  
 The graph below shows the Returning Institution Index, illustrating the ratio of institutions that participated in both a given and the previous edition of the conference in relation to all affiliations present in a given year.

 The experience to innovation index  
 Our experience to innovation index was created to show a cross-section of the experience level of authors publishing at a conference. The index includes the authors publishing at the last edition of a conference  , grouped by total number of publications throughout their academic career (P) and the total number of citations of these publications ever received (C).  
 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups:  
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25),
