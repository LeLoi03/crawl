 PLDI 2023  
 PLDI echoes FCRC  ’s statement regarding recent legislation in Florida. Anyone, from any background, should feel encouraged to participate and contribute to PLDI. Differences – in age, race, gender and sexual orientation, nationality, physical ability, thinking style and experience – bring richness to our efforts in providing quality programs and services for the global computing community. Thus, PLDI is committed to creating an environment that welcomes new ideas and perspectives, and where hostility or other antisocial behaviors are not tolerated.   
 PLDI is the premier forum in the field of programming languages and programming systems research, covering the areas of design, implementation, theory, applications, and performance.  
 PLDI’23 will held in-person as part of FCRC’23  , sharing the venue and activities with ten other top computer science conferences.  
 Free Virtual Attendance   
 We’re sorry that not all can attend the conference in Florida, whether due to recent laws passed in Florida, the difficulty many face in getting US visas, or the substantial cost involved in attending such a conference. However, we are very proud to provide free and open virtual access to the conference for all  , with talks streamed and PLDI papers available via open access.

 About 
 Call for Workshops and Tutorials  
 PLDI 2023 is a world-class forum for researchers and practitioners in programming language design and implementation. As in previous years, PLDI is soliciting proposals for co-located workshops and tutorials that will take place on Saturday June 17th, and Sunday June 18th  . Please propose your workshop or tutorial via the submission system.  
 The following details will be asked on submission:  
 Name of the workshop/tutorial. 
  Duration of the workshop/tutorial. 
  Event format: workshop/tutorial; type of submissions, if any; review process; results dissemination. 
  Expected attendance and target audience within the PLDI community. 
  How you plan to foster an inclusive environment and promote a diverse attendance. 
  Information on any previous iterations of the workshop or tutorial. 
  Note:  Workshops must make their own acceptance decisions by April 21, 2023  if there will be proceedings (final versions due May 5, 2023  ), or by May 5, 2023  if they do not have proceedings.  
 Submission   
 Workshops that would like their proceedings included in the ACM Digital Library must submit a proposal by November 18, 2022  .  
 Workshops and tutorials that will have no formal proceedings should submit a proposal by November 30, 2022  .  
 Review   
 Proposals are reviewed by the Workshop and Tutorials Chairs, and if necessary, by the PLDI general chair.  
 Proposals will be evaluated according to the relevance of the topic, the expertise and experience of the workshop organizers, and their potential to attract participants. 
  Proposals submitted between November 18th and 30th will be evaluated on a first-come-first-served basis. 
  Notification   
 We will notify workshop/tutorial acceptance by December 9th  .  
 Timeline   
 Submission deadline (with proceedings): November 18   
 Submission deadline (no proceedings): November 30   
 Notification: December 9   
 Dissemination   
 A proposal should clearly state how the results of the workshop — i.e., published papers and other outcomes — will be made available to participants and others before and after the workshop event. The Workshops and Tutorials Chair will provide guidance to the organizers of accepted workshops that wish to publish proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. For those that choose to publish their papers in ACM Digital Library, please add the following text in the workshop call for papers and on the website:  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)  
 Workshops that elect to publish proceedings can do so in the ACM Digital Library with sponsoring by SIGPLAN. The application for SIGPLAN sponsorship includes reviewing the proposed program committee with the SIGPLAN Executive Committee, a process which the chairs will help facilitate.

 Workshop Speaker's Guide  
 PLDI’23 Workshop Speaker’s Guide   
 This document is for those presenting a paper at a PLDI’23 workshop ( ARRAY  , ASA  , CSC  , DRAGSTERS  , EGRAPHS  , Infer  , PLARCH  , PLMW  , or SOAP  ). There are separate guides for PLDI, ISMM, and LCTES speakers.  
 Congratulations on being a presenter! This document will help ensure your presentation runs smoothly and has the best possible audience impact. Please read it in its entirety.  
 Checklist   
 Before PLDI:  
 Prepare and | practice | . 
  Ensure that | your talk runs for the correct duration | (be sure to check). 
 Video Consent   
 All workshop talks will be streamed via Discord and YouTube, and will be available later via SIGPLAN’s YouTube channel. All speakers must therefore consent to being recorded.  
 If you are participating in ARRAY or SOAP, which have published proceedings, then you will have completed the consent form when you finalized your paper with the publisher.  
 If you are participating in any other workshop, you will need to complete the ACM video consent form  and upload it using this Google form  .  
 Preparing Your Talk   
 Format: your presentation must be saved as a powerpoint or pdf file (sorry!) 
  Naming: 
  For ARRAY and SOAP, please use the paper ID assigned to you by the publisher (e.g. <paper ID>.[ppt,pptx,pdf]) 
  For all other workshops, please use the workshop name followed by speaker name in lower case with a [ppt,pptx,pdf] suffix (e.g. <arrray-smith.pptx). 
 Your talk will be streamed to Discord and YouTube. Your remote audience will be able to write questions in the Discord channel created for your session (they won’t be able to ask questions via audio or video). They should see your slides, and a video feed of you speaking.. As mentioned above, your session chair may relay questions from Discord.  
 Remote Presenters   
 Authors are expected to be present at the conference. If it is impossible for any of the authors to attend PLDI in person, you will need to have informed your program chair well in advance, and they may make special arrangements for you to present remotely.  
 The following notes apply only to those who have received permission from their program chair to present remotely. You should have been in direct contact with the PLDI video team on Discord.   
 Discord   
 We will use Discord as the virtual platform for this conference. You should familiarize yourself with Discord as an audience member well before your talk. We will use it for: a) the remote audience, b) delivery of remote talks, and c) communicating logistics.

  LCTES 2023   
  Welcome to the 24th ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED International Conference on L  anguages, C  ompilers, and T  ools for E  mbedded S  ystems ( LCTES  2023)!  
 LCTES provides a link between the programming languages and embedded systems engineering communities. Researchers and developers in these areas are addressing many similar problems but with different backgrounds and approaches. LCTES is intended to expose researchers and developers from either area to relevant work and interesting problems in the other area and provide a forum where they can interact.  
 LCTES’23 is co-located with PLDI  and FCRC 2023  , sharing the venue and activities with ten top computer science conferences.  
 Proceedings   
 The proceedings for LCTES 2023 are now available in the ACM Digital Library  .  
 Attendance policy   
 Accepted papers must be presented at LCTES 2023 to appear in the proceedings. Since FCRC is an in-person conference, presentations must be in person and the presenter must register for LCTES. Under special circumstances, pre-recorded presentations are allowed but require three virtual PLDI registrations to help us cover the cost of the proceedings. If you are unable to present your paper in person, contact the general chair  as soon as possible.  
 Registration is open   
 Registrations are now open  . Access to LCTES is possible with a 2-day or single-day (Sunday) pass as part of PLDI. Make sure to tick the “LCTES” box when signing up!  
 Accommodation

 Paper Categories   
 Full paper: 10 pages presenting original work. 
  Work-in-progress paper: 4 pages papers presenting original ideas that are likely to trigger interesting discussions. 
  Accepted papers in both categories will appear in the proceedings published by ACM. In addition, this year’s LCTES introduces two journal modes.  
 All accepted full papers will be invited to be published in a special issue of the ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS). A TECS publication will require substantial additional material over the conference publication and will undergo a separate review process. 
  Rejected full papers may have the option to submit their work to the IEEE Embedded Systems Letters (ESL; 4 pages). IEEE ESL submissions will undergo a separate review process. 
 Original contributions are solicited on the topics of interest including, but not limited to:   
 ACM Publications Policies   
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start, and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 Authors take note   
 The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 Submission  
 To enable double-blind reviewing, submissions must adhere to two rules:  
 author names and their affiliations must be omitted; and, 
  references to related work by the authors should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). 
  However, nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult (e.g., important background references should not be omitted or anonymized). Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as discussed here  . Authors of accepted papers will be required to sign an ACM copyright release.

 Call for Artifacts  
 Submission Site   
  Artifact Decision Notification  : May 12, 2023  
 General Info   
 The authors of all accepted LCTES papers (including WIP papers) are invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC) whose task is to assess how well the artifacts support the work described in the papers. This submission is voluntary but strongly encouraged and will not influence the final decision regarding the papers.  
 At LCTES, we follow ACM’s artifact review and badging policy, version 1.1  . ACM describes a research artifact as follows:  
 By “artifact” we mean a digital object created by the authors to be used as part of the study or generated by the experiment itself. For example, artifacts can be software systems, scripts used to run experiments, input datasets, raw data collected in the experiment, or scripts used to analyze results.  
 Submission of an artifact does not imply automatic permission to make its content public. AEC members will be instructed that they may not publicize any part of the submitted artifacts during or after completing the evaluation, and they will not retain any part of any artifact after evaluation. Thus, you can include models, data files, proprietary binaries, and similar items in your artifact.  
 We expect each artifact to receive three reviews. Papers that pass the Artifact Evaluation process will receive up to three ACM artifact evaluation badge(s) directly printed on the paper and available as meta information in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Artifact evaluation is single-blind. Please take precautions (e.g., turning off analytics and logging) to help prevent accidentally learning the reviewers’ identities.  
 Badging   
 The papers with accepted artifacts will be assigned official ACM artifact evaluation badges based on the criteria defined by ACM  . The AEC awards up to three types of badges that reflect the evaluation (red), availability (green), and validation (blue) of the artifact and the results of the paper. Refer to the ACM website  for detailed badge information. Note that artifacts will be evaluated with respect to the claims and presentation in the submitted version of the paper, not the camera-ready version   .  
 The awarded badges will appear on the first page of the camera-ready version of the paper. Artifact authors will be allowed to revise their camera-ready paper after being notified of their artifact’s publication to include a link to the artifact’s DOI.  
 Note that we only award the “Reproducibility” (dark blue) badge but not the “Replication” (light blue) one.  
 Guidelines   
 Carefully think which badge(s) you seek to receive | . | If your only goal is to publish your code, seek the “Availability” (green) badge. The reviewers will not exercise the artifact for its functionality or validate the paper’s claims. 
  If you wish you have your results reproduced without making your artifact documented, consistent, complete, and exercisable, seek the “Reproducibility” (blue) badge rather than the “Functionality/Reusability” (red) badge. 
  If you do not want to make the artifact available publicly, do not seek the “Availability” (green) badge. 
  Giving AE reviewers remote access to your machines with preinstalled (proprietary) software is possible. 
  Preparing the Artifact   
 You should make your artifact available as a single archive file and use the naming convention <paper #>.<suffix>  , where the appropriate suffix is used for the given archive format. Use a commonly-available compressed archive format such as .tgz, .tbz2, or .zip and open document formats. The link to download your artifact must protect the anonymity of the reviewers (e.g., a Google Drive URL).  
 The compressed archive should consist of three pieces:  
 The submission version of your accepted paper. 
  A | README | file (PDF or plaintext format) that explains your artifact (details below). 
  A folder containing the artifact. 
  The README.txt  should consist of two parts:  
 a | Getting Started Guide | and 
  Step-by-Step Instructions | that detail how your artifact can be evaluated. Include appropriate references to the relevant sections of your paper. 
  The Getting Started Guide  should contain instructions on how to set up (including, for example, a pointer to the VM player software, its version, and passwords if needed) and test your artifact. Anyone following this guide should be able to handle the rest of your artifact easily.  
 The Step by Step Instructions  explain how to reproduce experiments or other activities supporting your paper’s conclusions. Write this for readers who are deeply interested in your work and are studying to improve or compare against it. If your artifact runs for more than a few minutes, point this out and explain how to run it on smaller inputs.  
 Where appropriate, include descriptions of and links to files (included in the archive) that represent the expected outputs   such as log files generated by your tool for a given set of inputs. If there are warnings that can be ignored, explain what they are.  
 Further, include the following:  
 A list of claims from the paper supported by the artifact. Explain how and why the artifact supports those claims. 
  A list of claims from the paper | not | supported by the artifact. Explain why the artifact does not support those claims. Examples: performance claims cannot be reproduced in a VM, authors cannot redistribute specific benchmarks, etc. 
  When preparing your artifact, please keep in mind:

 This document is for those presenting a paper at LCTES’23. If you’re presenting at ISMM, PLDI, or a PLDI tutorial or workshop, please see the Speaker’s Guide on the page for the corresponding conference/track.  
 Congratulations on having your paper accepted at LCTES’23! This document will help ensure your presentation runs smoothly and has the best possible audience impact. Please read it in its entirety.  
 Checklist   
 Before LCTES:  
 There are many excellent sources of advice on giving good talks, including from Simon Peyton Jones  , Michael Hicks  , Michael Ernst  , and Derek Dreyer  . Make good use of these!  
 Mandatory Video Check   
 All speakers are required to be in the room and check in with their session chair and the video team no later than 5 minutes before their session starts. Please note that due to our very tight schedule, speakers who fail to upload their talk in advance and/or fail to attend the video check 5 minutes before their session may have their talk cut short if technical issues arise  .  
 Q&A   
 If you stick to the above schedule you will have about 3 minutes for questions. The in-room audience will be able to ask questions via a queue at a single microphone on a mic stand in the center of the room. In-room attendees and remote attendees will also be able to ask questions via Discord. Your session chair will monitor questions on Discord and might ask questions as they see them appearing there.  
 Your talk will be streamed to Discord and YouTube with live captioning. Your remote audience will be able to write questions in the Discord channel created for your session (they won’t be able to ask questions via audio or video). They should see your slides, a video feed of you speaking, and live captions. As mentioned above, your session chair may relay questions from Discord.  
 Remote Presenters   
 LCTES’23 authors are expected to be present at the conference. If it is impossible for any of the authors to attend LCTES in person, please let the chairs know immediately.  
 Discord   
 We will use Discord as the virtual platform for this conference. You should familiarize yourself with Discord as an audience member well before your talk. We will use it for: a) the remote audience, b) delivery of remote talks, and c) communicating logistics.  
 Accessing Papers   
 PLDI papers are all open-access and available from the ACM Digital Library. Just follow the small “DOI” link in the PLDI schedule below the paper.  
 In-Person Attendees   
 The venue for PLDI’23 is Orlando World Center Marriott  .  
 The map here  indicates where you’ll find key events.  
 Registration   
 Catering   
 Lunch and breakfast will be in Cypress 3, with the exception of Monday’s PLDI Awards Lunch, which will be held in Cypress 1.  
 Wi-Fi   
 FCRC provides wifi for the whole event. You should receive information on how to access it at the registration desk.  
 Discord   
 In-person attendees are warmly encouraged to use Discord (details below). You can use it to coordinate with colleagues, get updates on activities, and engage with authors via Q&A. You are very welcome to ask questions via each session’s text channel on Discord, before, during, and after the talk. If the session chair has time, they will ask the question on your behalf. Authors have been asked to check their channel for questions, so you can engage with the authors that way if not in person.  
 LCTES will be streamed to YouTube, and accessible to everyone (Tutorials are not streamed by our video team, but organizers may have made their own arrangements).  
 Each session will be streamed separately. The link to LCTES live stream will be visible at the top of the LCTES Discord channel and in the schedule.  
 We have paid for live subtitling of the main PLDI tracks.  
 Engaging in Q&A (Discord)   
 We encourage remote attendees to engage with talks via Discord (details below in the “Using Discord”  section).  
 Using Discord   
 As an affiliated conference, LCTES will use PLDI’s Discord server for virtual engagement. Discord is a social media platform that supports text, voice, and video chats. This section of the guide gives a brief overview of how we’ll use it and pointers to more general tips on how to use Discord.  
 Key information:  
 Our conference is completely | open and free for virtual attendees | , so our Discord server is open to everyone. 
  Please use this link  to join the PLDI’23 Discord server. 
  You can use Discord entirely | from the browser, or via an app | you install. 
  We have | one channel for each technical session | . Use that channel to engage virtually with the authors and other attendees. 
 You first need to open user settings. At the lower left corner, you should see a small icon with your avatar and your Discord username, with a gear symbol to the right of it. If you click on the gear icon, it will open user settings.  
 On the left-hand side, you’ll see menu options. Select “Profiles”.  
 First, update your nickname. Under “Profiles”, select the “Server Profiles” tab, and ensure that the server is “PLDI 2023” under “Choose a server” like this  , and then edit your “Server Nickname” to be your preferred name, including your pronouns if you wish.  
 Next, update your avatar if you wish. Under “Profiles”, select “User Profile” and under “Avatar” select “Change Avatar”.  
 Click on the “X” at the top right to exit the user settings dialogue.  
 PLDI’s Discord Setup   
 The most important thing to know is that we’ll have a text channel for each session, and that’s the place to go to engage with the speakers at that session. You’ll find them listed under “PLDI MAIN TRACK”, “ISMM & LCTES”, and “WORKSHOPS AND TUTORIALS” respectively, as shown here  . You’ll see one channel per session for PLDI, ISMM, and LCTES and one per event for the workshops and tutorials.  
 We also have a number of other channels, including ones for general questions (#general) and for social events.  
 Discord Etiquette   
 To help make the platform friendly and engaging, we encourage you to clearly identify yourself (see notes above on editing your profile).  
 PLDI is committed to creating a safe and respectful environment for everyone. This includes conversations on Discord. Please be respectful and kind in your interactions on Discord.  
 Discord for talk Q&A   
 You can use Discord to ask questions of the authors, before the talk, during the talk, and after the talk, whether you are on-site or remote. When time permits, during each live post-talk Q&A, session chairs will be able to consult Discord and read questions on behalf of the person who posted it. Authors are encouraged to go to Discord after their talk and respond to follow-up questions.

 "Prompt Patterns for Large Language Models" [Focus Group 3] 
 The world is rapidly adapting to advances in generative AI, and Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, and more, are leading this paradigm shift. One area that has been underexplored is "Prompt Engineering," which involves creating effective instructions to guide LLMs for desired outputs. This focus group aims to delve deeper into "Prompt Patterns"—a concept that draws heavily on 30+ years of experience with software patterns—that aid in creating more efficient and reusable solutions when interacting with LLMs. The following are some activities this focus group will engage in during PLoP 2023:  
 Pattern Identification and Categorization: Participants will split into small groups and identify common "prompt patterns" they've found effective in various use cases. Afterwards, we’ll regroup to share, categorize, and create a collaborative library of these patterns. 
  Live Prompt Engineering Session: We’ll present a real-world problem that requires the aid of an LLM for a solution. The focus group will engage in real-time in crafting and refining prompts. The objective is to assess the efficacy of pre-identified patterns in practical settings. 
 "Improving Your Papers with Academic Writing Patterns" [Focus Group 6] 
 In this focus group, participants will learn and talk about writing academic papers and how to improve their papers using Academic Writing Patterns (Adachi et al., 2023). Academic Writing Patterns is a pattern language for writing great academic papers. In Writer’s Workshops during PLoP conferences, discussions are more based on the content of the paper and patterns presented in the paper. With Academic Writing Patterns and this workshop, participants can learn how and what are important practices when writing academic papers that are structured and expressed in a way that is easy to understand and use, as well as making sure the content has novelty and originality. 
 "Learning about Organizational Patterns from Drama Patterns" [Focus Group 7] 
 Games 
 The PLoP Games Master is Christian Kohls  (see schedule) 
 Christian Kohls  PhD is a professor for computer science and socio-technical systems at Germany’s largest university of applied sciences, the TH Köln. Patterns are a big part of his life – including software patterns, educational patterns, and patterns for creative thinking. Being a regular PLoP participant he never misses a game session – for the fun, inspiration and community building. 
 Art School   
 Art School 
 At PLoP we believe that creativity knows no bounds. As you prepare to embark on a journey of exploration, learning, and connection, we invite you to immerse yourself in the vibrant world of art activities that will unfold throughout our three unforgettable days together. More information about the Art School can be found here. 
 Rebecca Rikner  is a bridge builder, change agent, award-winning graphic designer, and author of the book Design Thinking—The Key to Enterprise Agility, Innovation, and Sustainability. She has been part of the PLoP family for over twenty years.
