 CAiSE ’23  
 12/06/2023 – 16/06/2023, ZARAGOZA 2023   
 The conference will continue its tradition as the premiere venue for innovative and rigorous research across the whole spectrum of Information Systems Engineering with a special emphasis on the theme of Cyber-Human Systems  . This year’s theme reflects the increasingly coupled relationships between humans and computing, giving rise to cyber-human systems. The overall aim of these systems is to advance human abilities to work in complex environments. The theme refers to various aspects of the interface between humans and technology, with the intention to advance models, methods and theories relating to such systems. Examples include novel computing platforms (e.g., wearable devices), systems that interact with users through multiple modalities (e.g., brain-machine interfaces), human-in-the-loop approaches, local data processing in smart devices, and intelligent infrastructures for augmented life and society.

 CAiSE FORUM  
 CAiSE’23 Forum: Call for papers and tool demonstrations   
 The CAiSE Forum is a space within the CAiSE conference for presenting and discussing new ideas and tools related to information systems engineering. Intended to serve as an interactive platform, the Forum aims to present emerging topics and controversial positions, and to demonstrate innovative systems, tools and applications. The Forum sessions at the CAiSE conference will facilitate the interaction, discussion, and exchange of ideas among presenters and participants. Contributions to the CAiSE’23 Forum are welcome to address any of the CAiSE’23 conference topics and, particularly, this year’s theme— Cyber-Human Systems  .  
 We invite two types of submissions:  
 Visionary papers | present innovative research projects, which are still at a relatively early stage and do not necessarily include a full-scale validation. Visionary papers will be presented as posters in the Forum. 
  Demo papers | describe innovative tools and prototypes that implement the results of research efforts. The tools and prototypes will be presented as demos in the Forum, accompanied by a poster. 
  Both visionary papers and demo papers must not exceed 8 pages in LNCS format.  
 See authors guidelines  . Papers should be submitted in PDF format through the conference management system available at EasyChair  .  
 The submitted papers must be unpublished and must not be under review elsewhere.  
 Publication and Presentations    
 Authors should consult Springer’s authors guidelines and use their LaTeX or Word proceedings templates for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs  in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.  
 It is expected that at least one of the authors attends CAiSE’23, presents the poster/delivers the demo and interacts with the Forum participants.

  Abstract    
 The computational view of intuitionistic dependent type theory is as an intrinsic logic of (functional) programs in which types are viewed as specifications of their behavior. Equational reasoning is particularly relevant in the functional case, where correctness can be formulated as equality between two implementations of the same behavior. Besides behavior, it is also important to specify and verify the cost of programs, measured in terms of their resource usage, with respect to both sequential and parallel evaluation. Although program cost can - and has been - verified in type theory using an extrinsic formulation of programs as data objects, what we seek here is, instead, an intrinsic account within type theory itself. In this talk we discuss Calf, the Cost-Aware Logical Framework, which is an extension of dependent call-by-push-value type theory that provides an intrinsic account of both parallel and sequential resource usage for a variety of problem-specific measures of cost. Thus, for example, it is possible to prove that insertion sort and merge sort are equal as regards behavior, but differ in terms of the number of comparisons required to achieve the same results. But how can equal functions have different cost? To provide an intrinsic account of both intensional and extensional properties of programs, we make use of Sterling’s notion of Synthetic Tait Computability, a generalization of Tait’s method originally developed for the study of higher type theory. In STC the concept of a "phase" plays a central role: originally as the distinction between the syntactic and semantic aspects of a computability structure, but more recently applied to the formulation of type theories for program modules and for information flow properties of programs. In Calf we distinguish two phases, the intensional and extensional, which differ as regards the significance of cost accounting - extensionally it is neglected, intensionally it is of paramount importance. Thus, in the extensional phase insertion sort and merge sort are equal, but in the intensional phase they are distinct, and indeed one is proved to have optimal behavior as regards comparisons, and the other not. Importantly, both phases are needed in a cost verification - the proof of the complexity of an algorithm usually relies on aspects of its correctness. We will provide an overview of Calf itself, and of its application in the verification of the cost and behavior of a variety of programs. So far we have been able to verify cost bounds on Euclid’s Algorithm, amortized bounds on batched queues, parallel cost bounds on a joinable form of red-black trees, and the equivalence and cost of the aforementioned sorting methods. In a companion paper at this meeting Grodin and I develop an account of amortization that relates the standard inductive view of instruction seequences with the coinductive view of data structures characterized by the same operations. In ongoing work we are extending the base of verified deterministic algorithms to those taught in the undergraduate parallel algorithms course at Carnegie Mellon, and are extending Calf itself to account for probabilistic methods, which are also used in that course. (This talk represents joint work with Yue Niu, Harrison Grodin, and Jon Sterling.)

  Abstract    
 It is well-known that every regular language admits a unique minimal deterministic acceptor. Establishing an analogous result for non-deterministic acceptors is significantly more difficult, but nonetheless of great practical importance. To tackle this issue, a number of sub-classes of non-deterministic automata have been identified, all admitting canonical minimal representatives. In previous work, we have shown that such representatives can be recovered categorically in two steps. First, one constructs the minimal bialgebra accepting a given regular language, by closing the minimal coalgebra with additional algebraic structure over a monad. Second, one identifies canonical generators for the algebraic part of the bialgebra, to derive an equivalent coalgebra with side effects in a monad. In this paper, we further develop the general theory underlying these two steps. On the one hand, we show that deriving a minimal bialgebra from a minimal coalgebra can be realized by applying a monad on an appropriate category of subobjects. On the other hand, we explore the abstract theory of generators and bases for algebras over a monad.

  Abstract    
 Causality appears in various contexts as a property where present behaviour can only depend on past events, but not on future events. In this paper, we compare three different notions of causality that capture the idea of causality in the form of restrictions on morphisms between coinductively defined structures, such as final coalgebras and chains, in fairly general categories. We then focus on one presentation and show that it gives rise to a traced symmetric monoidal category of causal morphisms. This shows that causal morphisms are closed under sequential and parallel composition and, crucially, under recursion.

  Abstract    
 Aczel-Mendler bisimulations are a coalgebraic extension of a variety of computational relations between systems. It is usual to assume that the underlying category satisfies some form of axiom of choice, so that the theory enjoys desirable properties, such as closure under composition. In this paper, we accommodate the definition in a general regular category - which does not necessarily satisfy any form of axiom of choice. We show that this general definition 1) is closed under composition without using the axiom of choice, 2) coincides with other types of coalgebraic formulations under milder conditions, 3) coincides with the usual definition when the category has the regular axiom of choice. We then develop the particular case of toposes, where the formulation becomes nicer thanks to the power-object monad, and extend the formalism to simulations. Finally, we describe several examples in Stone spaces, toposes for name-passing, and modules over a ring.

 Submission Guidelines  
 High quality papers on unpublished research and implementation experiences may be submitted. All papers must be original and not substantially duplicated work that has been published at, or is simultaneously submitted to, a journal or another conference or workshop. All submissions must be written in English and span no more than 20 pages in the Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) format (a Springer template can be found in Overleaf), including title, abstract, and bibliography. The introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at the level understandable by a non-expert reader and explain the context to related work.  
 Submitted papers may contain supplementary material in the form of well-marked appendices of any length. However, the main paper should be intelligible without requiring the reader to consult supplementary material. Submissions must be anonymous  (no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious references). The conference will also consider short papers of up to eight pages in the LNCS format, excluding the bibliography, for results that are not yet fully fleshed out or that simply require few pages to describe but still make a significant contribution.  
 All submissions must be processed with LaTeX2e according to the instructions given by Springer. Submitted manuscripts must be typeset in plain Springer LNCS format in particular without changing the font size, margins or line spacing. Submissions not meeting these guidelines may be rejected without consideration of their merits.  
 Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format via EasyChair.
