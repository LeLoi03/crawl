  Abstract    
 The free space diagram is a popular tool to compute the well-known Fréchet distance. As the Fréchet distance is used in many different fields, many variants have been established to cover the specific needs of these applications. Often the question arises whether a certain pattern in the free space diagram is realizable, i.e., whether there exists a pair of polygonal chains whose free space diagram corresponds to it. The answer to this question may help in deciding the computational complexity of these distance measures, as well as allowing to design more efficient algorithms for restricted input classes that avoid certain free space patterns. Therefore we study the inverse problem: Given a potential free space diagram, do there exist curves that generate this diagram? Our problem of interest is closely tied to the classic Distance Geometry problem. We settle the complexity of Distance Geometry in ℝ^{>2}, showing ∃ℝ-hardness. We use this to show that for curves in ℝ^{≥2} the realizability problem is ∃ℝ-complete, both for continuous and for discrete Fréchet distance. We prove that the continuous case in ℝ¹ is only weakly NP-hard, and we provide a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm and show that it is fixed-parameter tractable. Interestingly, for the discrete case in ℝ¹ we show that the problem becomes solvable in polynomial time.

  Abstract    
 A subsequence of a word w is a word u such that u = w[i₁] w[i₂] … w[i_k], for some set of indices 1 ≤ i₁ < i₂ < … < i_k ≤ |w|. A word w is k-subsequence universal over an alphabet Σ if every word in Σ^k appears in w as a subsequence. In this paper, we study the intersection between the set of k-subsequence universal words over some alphabet Σ and regular languages over Σ. We call a regular language L k-∃-subsequence universal if there exists a k-subsequence universal word in L, and k-∀-subsequence universal if every word of L is k-subsequence universal. We give algorithms solving the problems of deciding if a given regular language, represented by a finite automaton recognising it, is k-∃-subsequence universal and, respectively, if it is k-∀-subsequence universal, for a given k. The algorithms are FPT w.r.t. the size of the input alphabet, and their run-time does not depend on k; they run in polynomial time in the number n of states of the input automaton when the size of the input alphabet is O(log n). Moreover, we show that the problem of deciding if a given regular language is k-∃-subsequence universal is NP-complete, when the language is over a large alphabet. Further, we provide algorithms for counting the number of k-subsequence universal words (paths) accepted by a given deterministic (respectively, nondeterministic) finite automaton, and ranking an input word (path) within the set of k-subsequence universal words accepted by a given finite automaton.

  Abstract    
 In this paper, we focus on the matrix completion problem and aim to minimize the diameter over an arbitrary alphabet. Given a matrix M with missing entries, our objective is to complete the matrix by filling in the missing entries in a way that minimizes the maximum (Hamming) distance between any pair of rows in the completed matrix (also known as the diameter of the matrix). It is worth noting that this problem is already known to be NP-hard. Currently, the best-known upper bound is a 4-approximation algorithm derived by applying the triangle inequality together with a well-known 2-approximation algorithm for the radius minimization variant. In this work, we make the following contributions: - We present a novel 3-approximation algorithm for the diameter minimization variant of the matrix completion problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approximation result that breaks below the straightforward 4-factor bound. - Furthermore, we establish that the diameter minimization variant of the matrix completion problem is (2-ε)-inapproximable, for any ε > 0, even when considering a binary alphabet, under the assumption that 𝖯 ≠ NP. This is the first result that demonstrates a hardness of approximation for this problem.

  Abstract    
 Treewidth is a useful tool in designing graph algorithms. Although many NP-hard graph problems can be solved in linear time when the input graphs have small treewidth, there are problems which remain hard on graphs of bounded treewidth. In this paper, we consider three vertex selection problems that are W[1]-hard when parameterized by the treewidth of the input graph, namely the capacitated vertex cover problem, the target set selection problem and the vector dominating set problem. We provide two new methods to obtain FPT approximation algorithms for these problems. For the capacitated vertex cover problem and the vector dominating set problem, we obtain (1+o(1))-approximation FPT algorithms. For the target set selection problem, we give an FPT algorithm providing a tradeoff between its running time and the approximation ratio.

  Abstract    
 We give a new rapid mixing result for a natural random walk on the independent sets of a graph G. We show that when G has bounded treewidth, this random walk - known as the Glauber dynamics for the hardcore model - mixes rapidly for all fixed values of the standard parameter λ > 0, giving a simple alternative to existing sampling algorithms for these structures. We also show rapid mixing for analogous Markov chains on dominating sets, b-edge covers, b-matchings, maximal independent sets, and maximal b-matchings. (For b-matchings, maximal independent sets, and maximal b-matchings we also require bounded degree.) Our results imply simpler alternatives to known algorithms for the sampling and approximate counting problems in these graphs. We prove our results by applying a divide-and-conquer framework we developed in a previous paper, as an alternative to the projection-restriction technique introduced by Jerrum, Son, Tetali, and Vigoda. We extend this prior framework to handle chains for which the application of that framework is not straightforward, strengthening existing results by Dyer, Goldberg, and Jerrum and by Heinrich for the Glauber dynamics on q-colorings of graphs of bounded treewidth and bounded degree.

  Abstract    
 A framework consists of an undirected graph G and a matroid M whose elements correspond to the vertices of G. Recently, Fomin et al. [SODA 2023] and Eiben et al. [ArXiV 2023] developed parameterized algorithms for computing paths of rank k in frameworks. More precisely, for vertices s and t of G, and an integer k, they gave FPT algorithms parameterized by k deciding whether there is an (s,t)-path in G whose vertex set contains a subset of elements of M of rank k. These algorithms are based on Schwartz-Zippel lemma for polynomial identity testing and thus are randomized, and therefore the existence of a deterministic FPT algorithm for this problem remains open. We present the first deterministic FPT algorithm that solves the problem in frameworks whose underlying graph G is planar. While the running time of our algorithm is worse than the running times of the recent randomized algorithms, our algorithm works on more general classes of matroids. In particular, this is the first FPT algorithm for the case when matroid M is represented over rationals. Our main technical contribution is the nontrivial adaptation of the classic irrelevant vertex technique to frameworks to reduce the given instance to one of bounded treewidth. This allows us to employ the toolbox of representative sets to design a dynamic programming procedure solving the problem efficiently on instances of bounded treewidth.

  Abstract    
 In this paper we propose a notion of pattern avoidance in binary trees that generalizes the avoidance of contiguous tree patterns studied by Rowland and non-contiguous tree patterns studied by Dairyko, Pudwell, Tyner, and Wynn. Specifically, we propose algorithms for generating different classes of binary trees that are characterized by avoiding one or more of these generalized patterns. This is achieved by applying the recent Hartung-Hoang-Mütze-Williams generation framework, by encoding binary trees via permutations. In particular, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between tree patterns and certain mesh permutation patterns. We also conduct a systematic investigation of all tree patterns on at most 5 vertices, and we establish bijections between pattern-avoiding binary trees and other combinatorial objects, in particular pattern-avoiding lattice paths and set partitions.

  Abstract    
 The celebrated notion of important separators bounds the number of small (S,T)-separators in a graph which are "farthest from S" in a technical sense. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of this powerful algorithmic primitive, tailored to undirected graphs, that is phrased in terms of k-secluded vertex sets: sets with an open neighborhood of size at most k. In this terminology, the bound on important separators says that there are at most 4^k maximal k-secluded connected vertex sets C containing S but disjoint from T. We generalize this statement significantly: even when we demand that G[C] avoids a finite set ℱ of forbidden induced subgraphs, the number of such maximal subgraphs is 2^𝒪(k) and they can be enumerated efficiently. This enumeration algorithm allows us to make significant improvements for two problems from the literature. Our first application concerns the Connected k-Secluded ℱ-free subgraph problem, where ℱ is a finite set of forbidden induced subgraphs. Given a graph in which each vertex has a positive integer weight, the problem asks to find a maximum-weight connected k-secluded vertex set C ⊆ V(G) such that G[C] does not contain an induced subgraph isomorphic to any F ∈ ℱ. The parameterization by k is known to be solvable in triple-exponential time via the technique of recursive understanding, which we improve to single-exponential. Our second application concerns the deletion problem to scattered graph classes. A scattered graph class is defined by demanding that every connected component is contained in at least one of the prescribed graph classes Π_1, …, Π_d. The deletion problem to a scattered graph class is to find a vertex set of size at most k whose removal yields a graph from the class. We obtain a single-exponential algorithm whenever each class Π_i is characterized by a finite number of forbidden induced subgraphs. This generalizes and improves upon earlier results in the literature.

  Abstract    
 Linear programming (LP) problems with gainfree Leontief substitution systems have been intensively studied in economics and operations research, and include the feasibility problem of a class of Horn systems, which arises in, e.g., polyhedral combinatorics and logic. This subclass of LP problems admits a strongly polynomial time algorithm, where devising such an algorithm for general LP problems is one of the major theoretical open questions in mathematical optimization and computer science. Recently, much attention has been paid to devising certifying algorithms in software engineering, since those algorithms enable one to confirm the correctness of outputs of programs with simple computations. Devising a combinatorial certifying algorithm for the feasibility of the fundamental class of Horn systems remains open for almost a decade. In this paper, we provide the first combinatorial (and strongly polynomial time) certifying algorithm for LP problems with gainfree Leontief substitution systems. As a by-product, we resolve the open question on the feasibility of the class of Horn systems.

  Abstract    
 An arborescence in a digraph is an acyclic arc subset in which every vertex except a root has exactly one incoming arc. In this paper, we show the reconfigurability of the union of k arborescences for fixed k in the following sense: for any pair of arc subsets that can be partitioned into k arborescences, one can be transformed into the other by exchanging arcs one by one so that every intermediate arc subset can also be partitioned into k arborescences. This generalizes the result by Ito et al. (2023), who showed the case with k = 1. Since the union of k arborescences can be represented as a common matroid basis of two matroids, our result gives a new non-trivial example of matroid pairs for which two common bases are always reconfigurable to each other.

  Abstract    
 We consider the min-max graph balancing problem with strict negative correlation (SNC) constraints. The graph balancing problem arises as an equivalent formulation of the classic unrelated machine scheduling problem, where we are given a hypergraph G = (V,E) with vertex-dependent edge weight function p: E×V ↦ ℤ^{≥0} that represents the processing time of the edges (jobs). The SNC constraints, which are given as edge subsets C_1,C_2,…,C_k, require that the edges in the same subset cannot be assigned to the same vertex at the same time. Under these constraints, the goal is to compute an edge orientation (assignment) that minimizes the maximum workload of the vertices. In this paper, we conduct a general study on the approximability of this problem. First, we show that, in the presence of SNC constraints, the case with max_{e ∈ E} |e| = max_i |C_i| = 2 is the only case for which approximation solutions can be obtained. Further generalization on either direction, e.g., max_{e ∈ E} |e| or max_i |C_i|, will directly make computing a feasible solution an NP-complete problem to solve. Then, we present a 2-approximation algorithm for the case with max_{e ∈ E} |e| = max_i |C_i| = 2, based on a set of structural simplifications and a tailored assignment LP for this problem. We note that our approach is general and can be applied to similar settings, e.g., scheduling with SNC constraints to minimize the weighted completion time, to obtain similar approximation guarantees. Further cases are discussed to describe the landscape of the approximability of this prbolem. For the case with |V| ≤ 2, which is already known to be NP-hard, we present a fully-polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS). On the other hand, we show that the problem is at least as hard as vertex cover to approximate when |V| ≥ 3.

  Abstract    
 Given a set P of n points and a set S of m disks in the plane, the disk coverage problem asks for a smallest subset of disks that together cover all points of P. The problem is NP-hard. In this paper, we consider a line-separable unit-disk version of the problem where all disks have the same radius and their centers are separated from the points of P by a line 𝓁. We present an m^{2/3} n^{2/3} 2^O(log^*(m+n)) + O((n+m)log(n+m)) time algorithm for the problem. This improves the previously best result of O(nm + n log n) time. Our techniques also solve the line-constrained version of the problem, where centers of all disks of S are located on a line 𝓁 while points of P can be anywhere in the plane. Our algorithm runs in O(m√n + (n+m)log(n+m)) time, which improves the previously best result of O(nm log(m+n)) time. In addition, our results lead to an algorithm of n^{10/3} 2^O(log^*n) time for a half-plane coverage problem (given n half-planes and n points, find a smallest subset of half-planes covering all points); this improves the previously best algorithm of O(n⁴log n) time. Further, if all half-planes are lower ones, our algorithm runs in n^{4/3} 2^O(log^*n) time while the previously best algorithm takes O(n²log n) time.

  Abstract    
 For any fixed positive integer r and a given budget k, the r-Eigenvalue Vertex Deletion (r-EVD) problem asks if a graph G admits a subset S of at most k vertices such that the adjacency matrix of G⧵S has at most r distinct eigenvalues. The edge deletion, edge addition, and edge editing variants are defined analogously. For r = 1, r-EVD is equivalent to the Vertex Cover problem. For r = 2, it turns out that r-EVD amounts to removing a subset S of at most k vertices so that G⧵ S is a cluster graph where all connected components have the same size. We show that r-EVD is NP-complete even on bipartite graphs with maximum degree four for every fixed r > 2, and FPT when parameterized by the solution size and the maximum degree of the graph. We also establish several results for the special case when r = 2. For the vertex deletion variant, we show that 2-EVD is NP-complete even on triangle-free and 3d-regular graphs for any d ≥ 2, and also NP-complete on d-regular graphs for any d ≥ 8. The edge deletion, addition, and editing variants are all NP-complete for r = 2. The edge deletion problem admits a polynomial time algorithm if the input is a cluster graph, while - in contrast - the edge addition variant is hard even when the input is a cluster graph. We show that the edge addition variant has a quadratic kernel. The edge deletion and vertex deletion variants admit a single-exponential FPT algorithm when parameterized by the solution size alone. Our main contribution is to develop the complexity landscape for the problem of modifying a graph with the aim of reducing the number of distinct eigenvalues in the spectrum of its adjacency matrix. It turns out that this captures, apart from Vertex Cover, also a natural variation of the problem of modifying to a cluster graph as a special case, which we believe may be of independent interest.

  Abstract    
 General factors are a generalization of matchings. Given a graph G with a set π(v) of feasible degrees, called a degree constraint, for each vertex v of G, the general factor problem is to find a (spanning) subgraph F of G such that deg_F(v) ∈ π(v) for every v of G. When all degree constraints are symmetric Δ-matroids, the problem is solvable in polynomial time. The weighted general factor problem is to find a general factor of the maximum total weight in an edge-weighted graph. Strongly polynomial-time algorithms are only known for weighted general factor problems that are reducible to the weighted matching problem by gadget constructions. In this paper, we present a strongly polynomial-time algorithm for a type of weighted general factor problems with real-valued edge weights that is provably not reducible to the weighted matching problem by gadget constructions. As an application, we obtain a strongly polynomial-time algorithm for the terminal backup problem by reducing it to the weighted general factor problem.

7. ISAGA_1 conference:
07.07.2023 - acrosslab    
 The research was presented on Thursday morning (06/07/23) during session 10, entitled “ Play for social and environmental changes: focus on farmers as players   ”. It was the occasion to present the game, to justify its use, present the first results, and have inspiring talks with the other panelists, also working with farmers with participatory simulations and serious games. The presentation was then followed by a discussion between the six panelists from session 10, answering questions from the public.  
 Finally, participating in ISAGA 2023 allowed us to follow up or discover inspiring research considering the way to approach gaming in research in developing countries, from design and conception to ethics and actual use.
