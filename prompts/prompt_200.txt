 4th Conference on Language, Data and Knowledge (LDK 2023)  
 Meeting Dates:  13-15 September 2023   
 Venue:  Vienna, Austria  
   DESCRIPTION  
 Language, Data and Knowledge  (LDK) aims at bringing together researchers from across disciplines concerned with the acquisition, curation and use of language data in the context of data science and knowledge-based applications. With the advent of the Web and digital technologies, an ever-increasing amount of language data is now available across application areas and industry sectors, including social media, digital archives, company records, etc. The efficient and meaningful exploitation of this data in scientific and commercial innovation is at the core of data science research, employing NLP and machine learning methods, as well as semantic technologies based on knowledge graphs   
 Language data is of increasing importance to machine learning-based approaches in NLP, Linked Data and Semantic Web research and applications that depend on linguistic and semantic annotation with lexical, terminological and ontological resources, manual alignment across language or other human-assigned labels. The acquisition, provenance, representation, maintenance, usability, quality as well as legal, organizational and infrastructure aspects of language data are therefore rapidly becoming major areas of research that are at the focus of the conference.

5. LFCS_1 conference:
In this paper I propose the non-Archimedean multiple-validity. Further, I build an infinite-order predicate logical language in that predicates of various order are considered as fuzzy relations. Such a language can have non-Archimedean valued semantics. For instance, infinite-order predicates can have an interpretation in the set [0, 1] of hyperreal (hyperrational) numbers. Notice that there exists an effectively axiomatizable part of non-Archimedean valued predicate logic, namely the class of higher-order formulas such that all their predicate quantifiers are universal (or existential). There exist various many-valued logical systems (see [9]). However non-Archimedean valued predicate logic has not been constructed yet. The idea of non-Archimedean multiple-validity is that (1) the set of truth values is uncountable infinite and (2) this set isn’t well-ordered. This idea can have a lot of applications in probabilistic reasoning (see [7], [13], [8]). In this paper I show that infini...

Thirty-Eighth Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on   
  Logic in Computer Science (LICS)   
  Boston • 26–29 June 2023    
  Call for Papers  
 Titles and Short Abstracts Due | 18 January 2023 
 Full Papers Due | 23 January 2023 
 Author Response Period | 15–19 March 2023 
 Author Notification | 5 April 2023 
 Conference | 26 – 29 June 2023 
 The paper must be in English and provide sufficient detail to allow the program committee to assess the merits of the paper. It should begin with a succinct statement of the issues a summary of the main results, and a brief explanation of their significance and relevance to the conference and to computer science, all phrased for the non-specialist. Technical development directed to the specialist should follow. References and comparisons with related work must be included. (If necessary detailed proofs of technical results may be included in a clearly-labeled appendix, to be consulted at the discretion of program committee members.) Submissions not conforming to the above requirements will be rejected without further consideration. Paper selection will be merit-based, with no a priori limit on the number of accepted papers. Papers authored or co-authored by members of the program committee are not allowed.  
 Results must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere, including the proceedings of other symposia or workshops. The program chair must be informed, in advance of submission, of any closely related work submitted or about to be submitted to a conference or journal. Authors of accepted papers are expected to sign copyright release forms. One author of each accepted paper is expected to register and present the paper at the conference. Remote presentations can be organized for authors who are not to be able to attend the meeting.  
 LICS 2023 will use a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Following this process means that reviewers will not see the authors' names or affiliations as they initially review a paper. The authors' names will then be revealed to the reviewers only once their reviews have been submitted.  
 To facilitate this process, submitted papers must adhere to the following:  
 Author names and institutions must be omitted and 
  References to the authors' own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not "We build on our previous work ..." but rather "We build on the work of ..."). 
  The purpose of this process is to help the reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission, makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult, or interferes with the process of disseminating new ideas. For example, important background references should not be omitted or anonymized, even if they are written by the same authors and share common ideas, techniques, or infrastructure. Authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas.  
 Kleene Award, Distinguished Papers and Special Issues  
 An award in honor of the late Stephen C. Kleene will be given for the best student paper(s), as judged by the program committee.  
 Around 10% of accepted papers will be selected as distinguished papers. These are papers that, in the view of the LICS program committee, make exceptionally strong contribution to the field and should be read by a broad audience due their relevance, originality, significance and clarity.  
 Full versions of up to three accepted papers, to be selected by the program committee, will be invited for submission to the Journal of the ACM. Additional selected papers will be invited to a special issue of Logical Methods in Computer Science.  
 Publication  
 The official publication date may differ from the first day of the conference. The official publication date may affect the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. We will clarify the official publication date in due course.

 Overview  
 The aim of the LOPSTR series  is to stimulate and promote international research and collaboration on logic-based program development. LOPSTR is open to contributions in logic-based program development in any language paradigm. LOPSTR has a reputation for being a lively, friendly forum for presenting and discussing work in progress.  
 LOPSTR 2023 will be held in-person at Hotel Cascais Miragem  in Cascais, Lisbon, Portugal and will be co-located with PPDP 2023 as part of SPLASH 2023. At least one of the authors of the accepted paper is expected to attend the conference and present the paper. Information about venue and travel is available on the SPLASH 2023 website  .  
 Topics of interest cover all aspects of logic-based program development, all stages of the software life cycle, and issues of both programming-in-the-small and programming-in-the-large, including, but not limited to:  
 synthesis 
 Survey papers that present some aspects of the above topics from a new perspective and papers that describe experience with industrial applications and case studies are also welcome.  
 PAPER SUBMISSION  
 Submissions can be made in two categories:  
  Short Papers (8 pages max.) 
 References do NOT count towards the page limit. Additional pages may be used for appendices not intended for publication. Reviewers are not required to read the appendices, and thus papers should be intelligible without them. All submissions must be written in English. Submissions must not substantially overlap with papers/tools that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal, conference, or workshop with refereed proceedings.  
 Submissions of Regular Papers  must describe the original work. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally published workshop proceedings may be submitted (please contact the PC chair in case of questions).  
 Submissions of Short Papers  may include presentations of exciting if not fully polished research and tool demonstrations that are of academic and industrial interest. Tool demonstrations should describe the relevant system, usability, and implementation aspects of a tool.  
 After the symposium, a selection of a few best papers will be invited for submission to rapid publication  in the Journal of Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)  . Authors of selected papers will be invited to revise and/or extend their submissions to be considered for publication. The papers submitted to TPLP will be subject to the standard reviewing process of the journal.  
 Submission Guidelines  
 Authors should submit an electronic copy of the paper (written in English) in PDF, formatted in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science style. Each submission must include on its first page the paper title; authors and their affiliations; contact author's email; abstract; and three to four keywords which will be used to assist the PC in selecting appropriate reviewers for the paper. Authors should consult Springer's authors' instructions at the author's page  , and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX  (available also in overleaf  ) or for Word  , for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs  in their papers. In addition, upon acceptance, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form  . The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.  
 Page numbers (and, if possible, line numbers) should appear on the manuscript to help the reviewers in writing their report. So, for LaTeX we recommend that authors use:  
 Best Paper Award  
 Thanks to Springer's sponsorship, two best paper awards (one for each submission category) will be given at LOPSTR 2023. The program committee will select the winning papers based on relevance, originality and technical quality but may also take authorship into account (e.g. a student paper).
