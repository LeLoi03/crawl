 SECRYPT is an annual international conference covering research in information and communication security. The International Conference on Security and Cryptography (SECRYPT) seeks submissions from academia, industry, and government presenting novel research on all theoretical and practical aspects of data protection, privacy, security, and applied cryptography. Note that while applied cryptography papers are welcome, pure cryptography papers are out of scope for the conference. Papers describing the application of security technology, the implementation of systems, and lessons learned are also encouraged. Papers describing new methods or technologies, advanced prototypes, systems, tools and techniques and vision papers indicating future directions are also encouraged.
