  CHI PLAY Steering Committee 
 Home     
 The Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play (CHI PLAY) is the international and interdisciplinary conference (by ACM SIGCHI) for researchers and professionals across all areas of play, games and human-computer interaction (HCI). We call this area “player-computer interaction”.  
 Visit CHI PLAY 2024 in Tampere, Finland    
 10-13 October 2023 – Stratford, Canada   
    In 2023, CHI PLAY will be hosted at the Stratford School of Interaction Design and Business  , located in Stratford, Ontario Canada, with a hybrid format.  
 CHI PLAY highlights and fosters discussion of current high-quality research in games and human-computer interaction as a foundation for the future of digital play. To this end, the conference blends streams of academic research papers, interactivities, interactive play demos, a student game design competition, a poster session and industry insights.  
 CHI PLAY grew out of the increasing work around games and play emerging from the ACM annual conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) as well as smaller conferences such as Fun and Games and Gamification. CHI PLAY is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group for Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI). All accepted submissions will be distributed in the CHI PLAY Conference Proceedings available in the ACM Digital Library, where they will remain accessible to thousands of researchers and practitioners worldwide.

   Conference Call for Papers  
 We invite contributions to CHI PLAY across a variety of research techniques, methods, approaches, and domains, including, but not limited to:  
  Playful interactions and new game mechanics  
  Multimedia (20.10%) 
  Human–computer interaction, Game design, Multimedia, Social psychology and Virtual reality are the subjects of interest in Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play. Human–computer interaction research featured in the conference incorporates concerns from various other topics such as Context (language use) and Process (engineering). The studies tackled, which mainly focus on Game design, apply to Game mechanics as well.  
 The main emphasis of the event is the subject of Game mechanics, focusing on Video game design. The conference investigates Multimedia research which frequently intersects with Session (computer science). The work on Social psychology tackled in it brings together disciplines like Video game and Applied psychology.  
 The work tackled in Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play goes beyond the discipline of Virtual reality as it also encompasses Immersion (virtual reality).  
 What are the most cited papers published at the conference?  
  Research areas of the most cited articles at Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play:  
 Human–computer interaction, Social psychology, Game design, Multimedia and Game mechanics are the main subjects of interest in the conference publications. In addition to Human–computer interaction research, the most cited articles aim to explore topics under Eye tracking and Conceptual framework. The published articles facilitate discussions on Social psychology that incorporate concepts from other fields like Social play, Perception and Player experience.  
 What topics the last edition of the conference is best known for?  
 Artificial intelligence 
  The Internet 
  The previous edition focused in particular on these issues:  
 Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play explores disciplines such as Human–computer interaction, Game design, Virtual reality, Process (engineering) and Social psychology. The research on Human–computer interaction tackled can also make contributions to studies in the areas of Event (computing), Video game and Relation (database). The research on Video game discussed in Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play draws on the closely related field of Applied psychology.  
 The featured Game design studies mainly concentrate on Internet privacy but also cover areas of interest in Context (language use). It connects research in Virtual reality with the related topic of Artifact (software development). The study on Process (engineering) presented in the conference intersects with subjects under the field of Entertainment.  
 The most cited articles from the last conference are:  
 Viruscape: A Microscopic Adventure Game to Guide Conceptual Learning of SARS-CoV-2 Mechanisms (0 citations) 
  Wander: A breath-control Audio Game to Support Sound Sleep (0 citations) 
  Papers citation over time  
 A key indicator for each conference is its effectiveness in reaching other researchers with the papers published at that venue.  
  Daniel Johnson | (29 papers) | absent at the last edition, 
  Jessica Hammer | (23 papers) | published 3 papers at the last edition the same number as at the previous edition.

 Publication chance based on affiliation  
 The publication chance index shows the ratio of articles published by the best research institutions at the conference edition to all articles published within that conference. The best research institutions were selected based on the largest number of articles published during all editions of the conference.  
 Returning Authors Index  
 A very common phenomenon observed among researchers publishing scientific articles is the intentional selection of conferences they have already attended in the past. In particular, it is worth analyzing the case when the authors participate in the same conference from year to year.  
 The Returning Authors Index presented below illustrates the ratio of authors who participated in both a given as well as the previous edition of the conference in relation to all participants in a given year.

 Returning Institution Index  
 The graph below shows the Returning Institution Index, illustrating the ratio of institutions that participated in both a given and the previous edition of the conference in relation to all affiliations present in a given year.

 The experience to innovation index  
 Our experience to innovation index was created to show a cross-section of the experience level of authors publishing at a conference. The index includes the authors publishing at the last edition of a conference  , grouped by total number of publications throughout their academic career (P) and the total number of citations of these publications ever received (C).  
 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups:  
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25),
