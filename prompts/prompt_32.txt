 The 22nd International Conference on Cryptology and Network Security (CANS) spans current advances in all aspects of cryptology, data protection, and network and computer security. Hosted by the School of Computer and Cyber Sciences, CANS 2023  will be held on the Riverfront Campus of Augusta University  , Augusta, Georgia, USA.  
 Co-located with CANS 2023 is the International Workshop on the Challenges in Cybersecurity Education  that will take place on October 30, 2023  
 The International Workshop on the Challenges in Cybersecurity Education addresses workforce cybersecurity education needs and challenges from the EU and US perspectives. The workshop features invited speakers who will address cybersecurity education initiatives and existing programs in the EU/US space. The relevant topics encompass the entire spectrum of cybersecurity training and education: K-12, two-year and four-year degree programs, graduate programs, and professional training. Included in the scope of the workshop is the role of Department of Homeland Security/Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency and the National Security Agency in developing the US academic response to cybersecurity education through the Centers of Academic Excellence program.

 To strengthen the link between security research and education, CARDIS 2023 invites proposals of interest for tutorial sessions to be held in presence before the conference, on Tuesday, 14th November, 2023  .  
 A tutorial session normally offers an introduction to a given topic and is delivered by an academic or industrial expert. Proposals are welcomed on any topic of broad interest to the CARDIS community.  
 Submission requirements  
  Name of the speaker(s), including affiliation and email address. 
  Statement of any logistical requirements (if applicable), e.g. state whether the participants need any particular software/hardware or state any particular room needs. 
  Mail your tutorial submission to: | cardis23tutorials@list.uva.nl 
  The submission deadline is: 24th August 2023  .
