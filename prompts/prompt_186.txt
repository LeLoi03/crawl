 Welcome to ISVC  
 COVID-19   Update:  Given that the current COVID-19 situation is relatively stable, we plan to hold the 19th International Symposium on Visual Computing (ISVC’24) in person  in Lake Tahoe, NV, October 21-23, 2024.  
 The purpose of the International Symposium on Visual Computing (ISVC) is to provide a common forum for researchers, scientists, engineers and practitioners throughout the world to present their latest research findings, ideas, developments and applications in visual computing. We seek papers describing contributions to the state of the art and state of the practice in the four central areas of visual computing: computer vision  , computer graphics  , virtual reality  , and visualization  . Of particular interest are papers that overlap with two or more areas.

 Submission  
 Submissions for the main symposium or a special track must be in PDF file format (20MB max size). Authors will be able to update/change their paper submission(s) before the deadline. All information submitted must be error free, as it will be used for reviewing purposes and to generate the final symposium program and proceedings. During submission, you will be asked to select some research topics (including special tracks) that best fit your paper(s). Please, carefully choose these topics as they will be used by the system to find qualified reviewers for your paper(s).  
 Each paper will be reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee (PC) using a “double-blind” review process to determine its appropriateness for acceptance and presentation (oral or poster) at ISVC. Therefore, paper submissions should not contain names or other information revealing authors’ identity  .  
 Review  
 This is a fully refereed symposium. Papers submitted to ISVC must not have been previously published and must not be currently under consideration for publication in another conference. Submissions will be reviewed with an emphasis on potential to contribute to the state of the art in the field. Selection criteria include accuracy and originality of ideas, clarity and significance of results, and presentation quality. The form of presentation (oral or poster) will be decided based on the reviews of each submission and recommendation of the program chairs and the steering committee.  
 ChatGPT policy:  ChatGPT can be used for proofreading assistance but NOT  for manuscript writing, manufacturing of data, results, and arguments. Strong suspicion of violation of the above policy will result in automatically rejecting the submission.  
 Attendance  
 ISVC is a premier forum for presenting and discussing current research in visual computing. At least one author must attend and present the paper at the symposium. If no author can attend the symposium and present their paper(s) due to unforeseen reasons, they should contact the steering committee chair to make alternative arrangements (i.e., video presentation or presentation by another attendee).  Papers not presented at the symposium without a valid reason will be withdrawn from the symposium proceedings.   
 Publication  
 All papers, regardless to the form of presentation (i.e., oral or poster), will appear in the symposium proceedings, which will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). In submitting a paper the author(s) agree that, upon acceptance, they will prepare the final manuscript in time for inclusion into the symposium proceedings, attend the symposium in person, and present the paper.  
 Formatting  
 To format your paper, follow the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) guidelines and technical instructions  closely. Springer will eventually re-format all papers to produce the camera-ready pdf versions using the same formatting instructions. Therefore, if an author has squashed his or her paper by removing vertical spaces or changing font sizes, etc., the final pdf will cover more pages and additional page charges will apply.  
 Color Pages  
 Camera-Ready Manuscripts  
 Papers will be published both in printed proceedings and online. Since papers would need to be reformatted, besides submitting the pdf version of your paper, you would also need to submit ALL  files needed for generating the pdf file, for example:  
 (1) the tex-file(s) including any special style files you may have used,  
  (2) all images and illustrations in PostScript and/or PDF, and the final document in  
  (3) DVI (or Word doc and rtf file),  
  (4) PostScript and  
  (5) PDF formats.  
 Create a single gzipped tar-file or a ZIP archive file containing all files. Specific instructions where to upload your gzipped file will be provided at a later time.  
 As noted earlier, Springer will re-produce the final pdf version of all papers. They will contact you by email at a later time (i.e., after 3-4 weeks) for final approval of your paper(s). The e-mail will come from India and will have attachments (i.e., make sure that your spam filter does not reject it!!).  
 Copyright form  
 The copyright form can be downloaded from the LNCS web site  . It must be signed by at least one author to publish the paper in Springer Lecture Notes on Computer Science. Papers without signed copyright form will not be included in the proceedings. Please sign the form and submit it along with your final paper materials. In the “Editors” field, please put “Bebis et al.”

 Call for Papers  
 ISVC seeks papers describing contributions to the state of the art and practice in the broad field of visual computing. The symposium is structured around the four central areas of visual computing:  
 Computer Vision 
  Computer Graphics 
  Virtual Reality 
  Visualization 
  In particular, we are interested in papers that combine technologies from two or more of these areas. In addition to the main symposium, we are soliciting papers for several special tracks related to ISVC. In submitting your paper, you should also check whether it might be a good fit for any of the special tracks  being organized this year.  
 Area 1: Computer Vision  
 Computer vision, the study of enabling computers to understand and interpret visual information from static images and video sequences, is expanding rapidly throughout the world. During the past ten years, computer vision has grown from a research area to a widely accepted technology, capable of providing dramatic increase in productivity and improving living standard. We are seeking papers covering both the theory and applications of computer vision. Topics of interest include all aspects of computer vision including, but not limited, to the following areas:  
  Applications 
  Area 2: Computer Graphics  
 Advances and breakthroughs in computer graphics have made visual media the basis of the modern user interface. It is clear that graphics will play a dominant role in the way people communicate and interact with computers in the future. ISVC seeks original research and applied papers in all areas of computer graphics. Topics of interest include all aspects of computer graphics including, but not limited, to the following areas:  
 Geometric Modeling 
  Physically Based Modeling 
  Applications 
  Area 3: Virtual Reality  
 Virtual reality (VR) enables users to experience a three-dimensional environment generated using computer graphics, and perhaps other sensory modalities, to provide an environment for enhanced interaction between a human user and a computer-created world. ISVC seeks original research and applied papers in all areas of virtual reality, as well as augmented reality, mixed reality and 3D HCI. Topics of interest include all aspects of virtual reality including, but not limited, to the following areas:  
 Augmented Reality 
  Mixed Reality
