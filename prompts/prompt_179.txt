 2023 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT'23)    
 2023 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT'23)    
 The 2023 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT'23) will be held June 25–30, 2023 in Taipei, Taiwan.   
 The 2023 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT'23) will be held June 25–30, 2023 in Taipei, Taiwan at the Taipei International Convention Center (TICC).   
  ISIT is the flagship international conference dedicated to the advancement of information theory and related areas.  
 Interested authors are encouraged to submit previously unpublished contributions from a broad range of topics related to information theory, including but not limited to the following areas:  
 Big Data Analytics 
  Source Coding and Data Compression 
  Wireless Communication and Networks 
  ISIT 2023 will be hybrid. There is an "in-person track" and a "virtual track". Note the different submission deadlines for the two tracks  :  
 deadline for virtual track: | January 3, 2023 
  deadline for in-person track: | NEW: extended to February 5, 2023 
  Also note that the number of presentation slots in the virtual track is limited and that therefore a virtual presentation slot cannot be guaranteed.  
 The virtual track will consist of live presentations of one of the authors during the regular conference time in front of a mixed virtual and live audience, i.e., the in-person attendees of the conference will be able to join the virtual sessions live in the conference center. Pre-recorded videos will not be accepted.  
 ISIT 2023 will follow a soft double-blind reviewing policy  . For details see the conference website.  
 We look forward to welcoming you in Taipei!

5. ISIT_2 conference:
IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory    
 The IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory, or ISIT, is the flagship conference of the IEEE Information Theory Society. The symposium centers around the presentation of previously unpublished contributions in all of the areas of information theory, including source and channel coding, communication theory and systems, cryptography and security, detection and estimation, networks, pattern recognition and learning, statistics, stochastic processes and complexity, and signal processing. Furthermore, it provides an open forum to discuss and exchange with other researchers on any of these topics.  
 The highlight of ISIT the Shannon Lecture, given by that year's holder of the Shannon Award. The following year's Shannon Award winner is also announced at ISIT.  
 Some people pronounce ISIT as eye-es-eye-tee. Others pronounce it eye-sit. Both pronunciations are acceptable.

 The IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI)  , sponsored by the IEEE ITS Society, is the leading international scientific conference on interdisciplinary research on information technology for intelligence, safety, and security. Over the years, the conference has evolved from its traditional orientation of intelligence and security domain towards a more integrated alignment of multiple domains, including technology, humans, organization, and security. The scientific community has increasingly recognized the need to address intelligence and security threats by understanding the interrelationships between these different components, and by integrating recent advances from different domains.
