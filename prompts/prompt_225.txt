 Smart IoT Sensing for Ageing Well: Research Activities and Future Directions  
 Michael Sheng, Macquarie University  
 Worldwide, the population is aging due to increasing life expectancy and decreasing fertility. The significant growth in older population presents many challenges to health and aged care services. Over the past two decades, the Internet of Things (IoT) has gained significant momentum and is widely regarded as an important technology to change the world in the coming decade. Indeed, IoT will play a critical role to improve productivity, operational effectiveness, decision making, and to identify new business service models for social and economic opportunities. Indeed, with the development of low-cost, unobtrusive IoT sensors, along with data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, there is now a significant opportunity to improve the wellbeing and quality of life particularly of our older population. In this presentation, we will overview some related research projects and also discuss several research directions.  
 Algorithms and Systems Enabling AI for Science  
  The official time zone for the conference is Japan Standard Time (GMT+9).

 Please Note  
 1. We expect at least one author of an accepted paper to attend the conference. The expectation of attendance is implicit in submitting a paper to a conference, rather than a journal, and brings ethical responsibilities to participate actively in the conference (talking to other attendees, presenting the paper, and attending conference sessions).  
  2. Consequently, it is expected that all accepted papers will be presented in person, unless clear and extenuating circumstances prevent attendance.  
  3. As an author of an accepted paper, this means you should exhaust all efforts to attend, including seeking a visa (where needed).  
  4. Any allowance for remote presentation will be considered only after clear evidence that attendance is impossible.  
  5. These decisions about remote presentation will be made two weeks before the conference begins.

 31st Euromicro International Conference on Parallel, Distributed, and Network-Based Processing  
 Parallel, Distributed, and Network-Based Processing  
 Parallel, Distributed, and Network-Based Processing has undergone impressive change over recent years. New architectures and applications have rapidly become the central focus of the discipline. These changes are often a result of the cross-fertilization of parallel and distributed technologies with other rapidly evolving technologies. Therefore, reviewing and assessing these new developments is paramount compared with recent research achievements in the well-established areas of parallel and distributed computing from industry and the scientific community. PDP 2023 will provide a forum for presenting these and other issues through original research presentations and facilitate the exchange of knowledge and new ideas at the highest technical level. This year's edition is part of the dissemination activities of the ADMIRE project, wich will also be an exhibitor at the conference Demo Area together with E4 Computer Engineering.

 The ADMIRE project  aims to avoid congestion and balance computational with storage performance when processing extremely large data sets. The main objective of the ADMIRE project is to establish this control by creating an active I/O stack that dynamically adjusts computation and storage requirements through intelligent global coordination, the malleability of computation and I/O, and the scheduling of storage resources along all levels of the storage hierarchy.

 HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING IN MODELLING AND SIMULATION     
 SCALABLE ALGORITHMS, LIBRARIES AND TOOLS FOR COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING ON NEW HETEROGENEOUS HPC SYSTEMS     
 Heterogeneity is emerging as one of the main characteristics of today’s and future HPC environments where different node organizations, memory hierarchies, and kinds of exotic accelerators are increasingly present. It pervades the entire spectrum of Computing Continuum, ranging from large Cloud infrastructures and Datacenter up to the Internet of Things and Edge Computing environments, aimed at making available in a transparent and friendly way the multitude of low-power and heterogeneous HPC resources available everywhere around us. In this context, for Computational Science and Machine Learning, it is essential to leverage efficient and highly scalable libraries and tools capable of exploiting such modern heterogeneous computers. These systems are typically characterized by very different software environments, which require a new level of flexibility in the algorithms and methods used to achieve an adequate level of performance, with growing attention to energy consumption. This conference Special Session aims to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss recent advances in parallel methods and algorithms and their implementations on current and future heterogeneous HPC architectures. We solicit research works that address algorithmic design, implementation techniques, performance analysis, integration of parallel numerical methods in science and engineering applications, energy-aware techniques, and theoretical models that efficiently solve problems on heterogeneous platforms.  
 We focus on papers covering various topics of interest that include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 Tools and programming environments support different forms of parallelism. 
 Workshop format   
 We aim at a half-day workshop.   
 We plan a combination of oral presentations, short talks about related topics from the main PDP conference, and a closing panel discussion.   
 We plan to host about 6 talks oral presentations, 20 minutes per talk, and 10 minutes for questions and discussion. Talks selection will be based on the interest of the talk and the relation with the workshop.   
 In addition to the selected talks, the workshop will also feature a keynote and invited short talks from the main PDP track with the goal of extending the scope of our workshop.   
 A final panel discussion will summarize the workshop and propose joint next steps to progress in Big Data–HPC convergence research in Supercomputers and large-scale distributed IT systems.   
 Attendance estimated is between 10 and 20 participants.   
 Publicity Plan   
 Committee  
 Many people worldwide are working together to PDP 2023.
