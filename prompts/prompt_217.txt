  NeurIPS 2023 FAQ for Authors  
 We will update this page as new questions arise. Please check back regularly. If you do not find an answer to your question here, you are welcome to contact the program chairs at neurips2023pcs@gmail.com  , but please make sure that you have read the call for papers  and this document first.  
 Accepted Papers  
  How do I submit the camera-ready paper?  To edit the Camera Ready file and information, go to the OpenReview page for the paper, and select Edit (top right corner) and then “Camera Ready Version”. 
  What is the page limit for the camera ready?        You get 1 extra page, so 10 pages of content. After the 10 pages, you can include (in this order):       acknowledgements, bibliography and appendices. Do not include hard-to-read material like code, data etc. This can go into the supplementary.       IMPORTANT: Please start the appendices on a new page. There’s a possibility that we’ll need to aggregate all papers into a single proceedings file, and we’d like to keep that one without appendices. Having appendices on a new page we’ll allow us to do this automatically. 
  Do you need to include a paper checklist?        No, there was no checklist in the PDF this year, so this is not needed. 
  Can you include the appendix in the same PDF?        Yes, after the acknowledgement and references. You can also include it in the supplementary materials. 
  Can you edit the title, keywords and the abstract?        Yes, as long as they do not substantially differ from the original submission. 
  Can you edit the author list?        You can reorder the author lists freely, but you’d need special permission from the Program Chairs if you want to remove or add an author. 
  Submission process  
 Can the author list be changed?  Changes may be made to the author list until the abstract deadline. After that, authors may be reordered if/when your paper is accepted, but any additions or removals will be extremely rare and must be justified in writing and approved on a case-by-case basis by the program chairs. 
  Do my co-authors need to create an OpenReview account?  Yes. Before the full paper deadline, every co-author needs to create (or update) an OpenReview profile. The information entered in the profile is used for conflict resolution, as discussed in this document  . 
  I don't have a DBLP page or previous publications, how can I complete my OpenReview profile?  It is okay to leave the DBLP and papers empty in this case, but please make sure to add all of your email addresses and add your affiliations under "Education & Career History". Also please fill out this no prior publications form  . 
  I have publications but no DBLP page.  You can import your papers directly into Openreview. 
  I have publications but not in Computer Science. Do I need to upload them?  No. 
  I missed the abstract submission deadline. Can I still submit a full paper?  No. The abstract submission deadline is firm. 
  Can I submit supplementary material after the deadline?  Yes. The deadline for supplementary material (including appendix and source code) is one week after the paper deadline. Check the call for papers for the exact day and time. 
  Can I withdraw my submission?  Yes. You can withdraw your submission at any point in the reviewing process. 
  What exactly should be submitted by the abstract deadline?  The abstract of your paper, which can be edited afterwards up until the full paper deadline. You can also submit the full paper if you wish. 
  Submission format and content  
 Can I include appendices in my main submission file?  No. You can include them in the supplementary materials. 
  I would like to write my paper using Microsoft Word, but I don’t see a template. Can you provide one?  No. The Microsoft Word template has been discontinued. Authors must use the NeurIPS 2023 LaTeX style file. 
  Is a "broader impact" statement required and must it fit within the page limit?  You are not required to include a section titled "broader impacts" in your paper. However, you should still consider any potential negative societal impacts of your work. You may include a discussion of these potential negative societal impacts anywhere in the paper (in the intro, in the conclusion, as a stand-alone section, in the supplemental material if appropriate, etc.), but this discussion may not exceed the page limit. See the checklist guidance  and blog post  for more information. 
  What material is allowed beyond the nine-page limit?  The main body of your paper must be contained in the first nine pages of your submission. Only references are not included in this page limit. You may include an appendix in a separate document as part of your supplemental material. 
  What is the policy on comparisons to recent work?  Papers appearing less than two months before the submission deadline are generally considered concurrent to NeurIPS submissions. Authors are not expected to compare to work that appeared only a month or two before the deadline. 
  Are arxiv papers also subject to the policy above?  Yes, we do not distinguish arxiv papers and other published (conference & journal) papers, and the two-month rule applies in the same way. More nuanced judgements, including how to determine the date of publication, should be made by the area chair handling the submission. 
  Dual submissions  
 Can I submit work to NeurIPS that is currently in submission to another archival venue?  The NeurIPS policy on dual submissions explicitly prohibits this. You need to withdraw your submission from the other venue before submitting to NeurIPS. 
  Can I submit work to NeurIPS and then later submit the same work to another archival venue while it is still under review at NeurIPS?  The NeurIPS policy on dual submissions explicitly prohibits this. You need to withdraw your submission from NeurIPS first. 
  Can I submit work that is in submission to, has been accepted to, or has been published in a non-archival venue (e.g. arXiv or a workshop without any official proceedings)?  Yes, as long as this does not violate the other venue's policy on dual submissions (if it has one). 
  Can I submit work to NeurIPS and then later submit the same work to a non-archival venue while it is still under review at NeurIPS?  Yes, as long as this does not violate the other venue's policy on dual submissions (if it has one). 
  Questions related to OpenReview  
 Why haven't I received any emails about my submission?  All emails are sent from noreply@openreview.net. If you are an author and not receiving email, please log into your OpenReview account and make sure that your preferred contact email is up to date. We have heard that some email servers are rejecting email from OpenReview. If you suspect this might apply to your email server, we recommend that you use a different email address. 
  Reviewing/Discussion process  
 When will the reviews be available? When is the rebuttal due? | Please refer to the main conference track | dates | . 
  Will the rebuttals be shown to the reviewers/ACs immediately? | No, the rebuttals will be revealed to the reviewers/ACs at the end of the rebuttal period. 
  Can we upload a revision of our paper during the rebuttal/discussion period? | No revisions are allowed until the camera-ready stage. 
  Can we upload a revision of the supplementary materials during the rebuttal/discussion period? | No. You may revise it for the camera-ready stage. 
  Can the rebuttal include new results? | Yes, however your original submission will serve as the basis for the reviewers' (and ACs') acceptance recommendations. The rebuttals should serve only to clarify the reviewers' and ACs' questions during the discussion period. 
  Can we include an anonymous link in the author rebuttal? | No. Do not use links in any part of the response. The only exception is if the reviewers asked for code, in which case you can send an anonymized link to the AC in an Official Comment (make sure all linked files are anonymized). 
  Reviewers posted last-minute questions, and the reviewer-author discussion has closed. What do we do? | Area chairs are fully aware that authors cannot respond to last-minute questions, so they will take that into account. We cannot extend the author-reviewer discussion period, as many authors, reviewers, and ACs have planned their work according to our schedule, and extensions would cause delay and additional burden for all involved. 
  Where can I see my submitted PDF for the author-rebuttal? | There is a link to the PDF at the end of the global rebuttal. 
  What is the "Official Comment" button for? | The official comment button serves to send messages to specific readers. During the rebuttal phase it will only be possible to use it for sending messages to the AC. During the rebuttal phase, do not use the "Official Comment" for posting rebuttal text that should be read by the reviewers. Use the "Rebuttal" buttons for that. During the discussion phase you will be able to use that button for sending messages to either the reviewres or the AC. Make sure the "readers" of the message are those you intend to read it.

 Call for paper: THE 28TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NATURAL LANGUAGE & INFORMATION SYSTEMS  
  older     
  February 
  January 
  ----- 2023 ----- 
  December 
  November 
 The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has recently experienced several exciting developments. In research, these developments have been reflected in the emergence of neural language models (Deep Learning, Word Embeddings, Transformers) and the importance of aspects such as transparency, bias and fairness, a (renewed) interest in various linguistic phenomena, such as in discourse and argumentation mining, and in new problems such as the detection of disinformation and hate speech in social media, as well of mental health disorders that increased during the recent pandemic. Regarding applications, NLP systems have evolved to the point that they now offer real-life, tangible benefits to enterprises. Many of these NLP systems are now considered a de-facto offering in business intelligence suites, such as algorithms for recommender systems and opinion mining/sentiment analysis.  
 It is against this backdrop of recent innovations in NLP and its applications in information systems that the 28th edition of the NLDB conference takes place. We welcome research and industrial contributions, describing novel, previously unpublished works on NLP and its applications across a plethora of topics as described in the Call for Papers.  
 Call for Papers NLDB 2023 invites authors to submit papers for oral or poster presentations on unpublished research that addresses theoretical aspects, algorithms, applications, architectures for applied and integrated NLP, resources for applied NLP, and other aspects of NLP, as well as survey and discussion papers.  
 Authors should follow the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) format and submit their manuscripts as a PDF via Easychair.

  DEMO SESSIONS 
 In addition to being an historical event for the scientific community, NOMS 2023 will host an exciting program including keynotes, panels, technical sessions, demo sessions, dissertation session, mini-conference sessions, poster sessions, tutorials, and workshops. These events provide rich opportunities for participants to learn, share, exchange, and set the current and future directions and developments of network operations and management.  
 NOMS 2023 comes at the right time where the networks and services play a critical role in new value creation, businesses growth but also in contributing to the development of humanity.  
 This year's theme is “Integrated Management Towards Resilient Networks and Services.”  
 Technologies evolve at a fast pace in networking: 5G networks are being deployed and 6G network technological components are already developed and the overall architecture is in an active specification phase. Softwarization is being generalized at all levels of the protocol stacks and agile processes are in place to speed up dynamic service delivery and quality assurance across the globe and beyond. Digital twins of networks emerge to ease and automate the huge demand on monitoring, control and management of the underlying highly dynamic environments. Finally, numerous machine learning approaches are already utilized for optimized control, security and management.  
 Recent history has shown that the dynamics and manageability of networks are major value to maintain connectivity and service quality under extreme external conditions like the pandemics or in a situation of war. All-level programmability also opens new challenges to make the complex task of networking resilient.  
 NOMS 2023 is becoming a reality thanks to the involvement of all those in the network and service management community who share their passion for the field and who spend time to its development: participants, sponsors, authors, PhD and Master students, engineers working in the field, TPC co-chairs and members, Workshop, tutorial, session organizers and many more. As General Co-Chairs, we are extremely proud and happy to help the field grow !

 MESSAGE TO ALL IN PERSON PARTICIPANTS  
 Due to the current energy supply crisis, Aarhus University has lowered the indoor temperature to 19C  .  
  Please remember to bring suitable clothing to keep warm.  
 Participative computing for sustainable futures  
 NordiCHI 2022 in Aarhus will continue the NordiCHI tradition of being an international-level venue for dissemination and development of Human-Computer Interaction research in the broadest sense. The conference will be held in Aarhus, Denmark on October 8-12 2022. This website will be updated with more detailed information as the conference approaches.  
 NordiCHI 2022 in Aarhus will highlight the Nordic traditions for bringing research into societal context through the choice of keynote speakers, panels and other invited sessions; and through outreach to public sector, industrial, civil society and cultural actors.  
 Participatory design has grown out of Nordic research, together with the trade unions emphasising workers’ rights to codetermination and control over professional quality. While participation has become a widespread method in design, it still denotes a shift to understand users as active participants taking control, rather than users as system components. When people participate actively, they are not merely users: they are workers, citizens, artists, students, tenants, etc.  
 NordiCHI 2022 in Aarhus promotes sustainable futures by celebrating active participation in the development and use of interactive technologies.

9. NordiCHI_2 conference:
Our conference theme,  Pulse – exploring the energy that drives us   , represents the dynamic highs and calm lows of life, keeping us thriving. Vaasa is known for both its vibrant energy industry as the Nordic energy cluster and the tranquility of its surrounding nature and UNESCO World Heritage site. Thus, it serves as the perfect backdrop for exploring the elements of life in the coming ages of HCI.    
 Our program will include sessions that reflect a wide range of perspectives—from theoretical and practical insights to creative explorations. We invite you to participate in insightful panels, dynamic workshops and tutorials, and demonstrations that highlight innovative research and applications in HCI.   
 The program will feature engaging sessions, including arts-based approaches that integrate creative expression with HCI research, informal coffee-table discussions for reflection and idea exchange, and industry sessions that connect practitioners with researchers to share practical insights. These sessions, along with thought-provoking critiques and poster presentations showing the late-breaking work, provide ample opportunities for collaboration and engagement.
