  SEC 2023 – Trustworthy Edge Computing Workshop  
  Organized in conjunction with ACM SEC 2023, Wilmington, DE, USA, Dec. 9th 2023  
  Edge computing has become a topic of significant interest in academic and industrial research, driven by the fundamental improvements in latency, bandwidth savings and energy efficiency it offers with respect to offloading application workloads. While many envisioned applications in edge computing are relevant in the context of real-time analytics and feedback, most of the research today approaches edge computing from a “best effort” perspective, focusing on expected/average system behavior.  
  Distributed ledger technology (DLT) & blockchain for trustworthy edge computing

  Overview and Scope  
 The conference aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry and government, to advance the state of the art in formal methods, to facilitate their uptake in the software industry, and to encourage their integration within practical software engineering methods and tools.  
 The topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following aspects of software engineering and formal methods.  
 Software Development Methods  
  Education 
  Case studies, best practices, and experience reports  
 Paper submission  
 We solicit two categories of papers:  
 Regular papers | describing original research results, case studies, or surveys, should not exceed | 16 pages | (excluding bibliography of at most two pages). 
 Artifact Evaluation  
 This edition of SEFM introduces an artifact evaluation (AE). An artifact contains any necessary material to support the claims made in the paper and ideally makes the results fully reproducible. Submission of an artifact is optional for regular papers  and mandatory for tool papers  . The artifacts will be judged by the Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC). More details can be found on the artifact page  .  
 Publication  
 The authors of a selected subset of accepted papers will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers to special issues of the journal Software and Systems Modeling  (SoSyM).
