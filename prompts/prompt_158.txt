  The conference primarily tackles Artificial intelligence, Mathematical optimization, Machine learning, Artificial neural network and Pattern recognition. The Artificial intelligence study featured in IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence draws parallels with the field of Computer vision. IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence connects research in Mathematical optimization with the related topic of Benchmark (computing).  
 The research on Machine learning tackled can also make contributions to studies in the areas of Data modeling and Data mining. The work tackled in the conference goes beyond the discipline of Data mining as it also encompasses Cluster analysis. The research on Evolutionary algorithm discussed in IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence draws on the closely related field of Evolutionary computation.

 Publication chance based on affiliation  
 The publication chance index shows the ratio of articles published by the best research institutions at the conference edition to all articles published within that conference. The best research institutions were selected based on the largest number of articles published during all editions of the conference.  
 Returning Authors Index  
 A very common phenomenon observed among researchers publishing scientific articles is the intentional selection of conferences they have already attended in the past. In particular, it is worth analyzing the case when the authors participate in the same conference from year to year.  
 The Returning Authors Index presented below illustrates the ratio of authors who participated in both a given as well as the previous edition of the conference in relation to all participants in a given year.

 The experience to innovation index  
 Our experience to innovation index was created to show a cross-section of the experience level of authors publishing at a conference. The index includes the authors publishing at the last edition of a conference  , grouped by total number of publications throughout their academic career (P) and the total number of citations of these publications ever received (C).  
 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups:  
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25),

 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Security and Defense Applications (IEEE CISDA)  
 Given the current global security environment, there has been increased interest within the security and defense communities in novel techniques for solving challenging problems. The genesis of this interest lies in the fact that repeated attempts of using traditional techniques have left many important problems unsolved, and in some cases, not addressed. New problems have emerged within the broad areas of security and defense that are difficult to tackle with conventional methods, thus requiring new techniques for detecting and adapting to emerging threats. The purpose of the symposium is to present current and ongoing efforts in computational intelligence (e.g., neural networks, fuzzy systems, evolutionary computation, swarm intelligence, and other emerging learning or optimization techniques) as applied to security and defense problems.

 Uniting experts in the world of Intelligent Systems  
 Continuing the legacy of successful conferences such as ISâ02, ISâ04, ISâ08, ISâ12, ISâ16, ISâ20 (held in Sofia and Varna, Bulgaria), ISâ06, ISâ10 (held in London, UK), ISâ14, ISâ22 (held in Warsaw, Poland), ISâ18 (held in Funchal, Madeira Island, Portugal), the 12th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Systems, ISâ24, aims to bring together leading specialists in the expansive field of intelligent systems. This forum presents a unique opportunity for scientists from around the globe to share their ideas and achievements in the theory and practice of intelligent control, artificial intelligence, decision support systems, neural networks, soft computing, data mining and knowledge discovery, ontologies, machine learning, intelligent measurement, and other related topics. The conference aims to highlight contemporary intelligent systems as a concept that unifies theoretical research and applications in automation, information technologies, and measurement. All aspects of intelligent systems are of interest, including theory, algorithms, tools, applications, and more.  
 In addition to the main sessions, the conference timetable will include several other symposiums, workshops, poster sessions, tutorial courses, and a student session, all covering similar scopes. These events will take place before, during, and after the conclusion of the IEEE ISâ24.  
 The ISâ02 up to ISâ22 conferences have established themselves as scientific forums known for gathering only high-quality papers and presentations that meet rigorous scientific standards. Following this tradition, all submitted original papers for ISâ24 will undergo careful review for possible inclusion in the Conference Proceedings. Additionally, after the Conference, a selected number of the best papers will be further expanded and revised for potential inclusion in the Journal of Intelligent Systems and other reputable journals or Springer books.
