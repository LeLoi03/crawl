 About 
 Scope   
 In addition to the traditional PEPM topics (see below), PEPM 2023 welcomes submissions in new domains, in particular:  
 Semantics based and machine-learning based program synthesis and program optimisation. 
  Modelling, analysis, and transformation techniques for distributed and concurrent protocols and programs, such as session types, linear types, and contract specifications. 
  More generally, topics of interest for PEPM 2023 include, but are not limited to:  
 Program and model manipulation techniques such as: supercompilation, partial evaluation, fusion, on-the-fly program adaptation, active libraries, program inversion, slicing, symbolic execution, refactoring, decompilation, and obfuscation. 
  Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including metaprogramming, generative programming, embedded domain-specific languages, program synthesis by sketching and inductive programming, staged computation, and model-driven program generation and transformation. 
  Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model manipulation such as: abstract interpretation, termination checking, binding-time analysis, constraint solving, type systems, automated testing and test case generation. 
  Application of the above techniques including case studies of program manipulation in real-world (industrial, open-source) projects and software development processes, descriptions of robust tools capable of effectively handling realistic applications, benchmarking. Examples of application domains include legacy program understanding and transformation, DSL implementations, visual languages and end-user programming, scientific computing, middleware frameworks and infrastructure needed for distributed and web-based applications, embedded and resource-limited computation, and security. 
  This list of categories is not exhaustive, and we encourage submissions describing new theories and applications related to semantics-based program manipulation in general. If you have a question as to whether a potential submission is within the scope of the workshop, please contact the programme co-chairs, Edwin Brady ( ecb10@st-andrews.ac.uk  ) and Jens Palsberg ( palsberg@ucla.edu  )  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference.

  Semantics-preserving source-to-source program transformations, such as optimization and refactoring, are essential for software development. Such transformations are often defined by rewriting rules  describing which part of a program must be replaced with which subprogram. The main obstacle to designing a transformation is to prove its semantics preservation. Rewriting-rule-based frameworks alleviate this difficulty by giving proof guidelines or automating the proofs. Unfortunately, each framework is applicable to a restricted set of transformations due to a fixed definition of semantics preservation. Cousot and Cousot’s semantic transformation framework  resolves this problem by leaving a space for its users to define a proper semantics preservation property. However, the framework does not exploit the characteristic of rewriting rules and fails to ease the proofs. In this work, we define a semantic transformation framework tailored to rewriting rules by refining Cousot and Cousot’s framework. Our framework facilitates modular proofs by providing syntax-directed guidelines  and theorems that simplify proofs. We show the versatility of our framework by proving the semantics preservation of six well-known transformations.

  The simulation of quantum programs by classical computers is a critical endeavor for several reasons: it provides proof-of-concept validation of quantum algorithms; it provides opportunities to experiment with new programming abstractions suitable for the quantum domain; and most significantly it is a way to explore the elusive boundary at which a quantum advantage may materialize. Here, we show that traditional techniques of symbolic evaluation and partial evaluation yield surprisingly efficient classical simulations for some instances of textbook quantum algorithms that include the Deutsch, Deutsch-Jozsa, Bernstein-Vazirani, Simon, Grover, and Shor's algorithms. The success of traditional partial evaluation techniques in this domain is due to one simple insight: the quantum bits used in these algorithms can be modeled by a symbolic boolean variable while still keeping track of the correlations due to superposition and entanglement. More precisely, the system of constraints generated over the symbolic variables contains all the necessary quantum correlations and hence the answer to the quantum algorithms. With a few programming tricks explained in the paper, quantum circuits with millions of gates can be symbolically executed in seconds. Paradoxically, other circuits with as few as a dozen gates take exponential time. We reflect on the significance of these results in the conclusion.

  Program-generation techniques prevail in domains that need high performance, such as linear algebra, image processing, and database. Yet, it is hard to generate high-performance programs with correctness assurance, and cryptography needs both. Masuda and Kameyama proposed a DSL-based framework for implementing a program generator, an analyzer, and a formula generator, and obtained an efficient and correct implementation of Number-Theoretic Transform (NTT) that is necessary for many cryptographic algorithms.  
  This paper advances their study in two ways. First, we develop a generation-and-analysis framework so that program generation is driven by program analysis. As a concrete result, we have found an optimization missed in previous studies. Second, we investigate whether the framework can be applied to other algorithms, including inverse NTT. By combining generated programs, we have obtained an efficient and correct implementation of polynomial multiplication, the key for several post-quantum cryptographic algorithms.

  Strategic term re-writing and attribute grammars are two powerful programming techniques widely used in language engineering. The former relies on strategies to apply term re-write rules in defining large-scale language transformations, while the latter is suitable to express context-dependent language processing algorithms. These two techniques can be expressed and combined via a powerful navigation abstraction: generic zippers. This results in a concise zipper-based embedding offering the expressiveness of both techniques.  
  Such elegant embedding has a severe limitation since it recomputes attribute values. This paper presents a proper and efficient embedding of both techniques. First, attribute values are memoized in the zipper data structure, thus avoiding their re-computation. Moreover, strategic zipper based functions are adapted to access such memoized values. We have implemented our memoized embedding as the Ztrategic library and we benchmarked it against the state-of-the-art Strafunski and Kiama libraries. Our first results show that we are competitive against those two well established libraries.

 PerCom 2023  
 The 21st International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom 2023)   
 March 13-17, 2023 in Atlanta, USA.  
  Conference Overview   
 IEEE PerCom, now in its 21st year, will be held in Atlanta, Georgia (USA), during March 13-17, 2023, as a physical in-person conference. PerCom is the premier annual scholarly venue in pervasive computing and communications. Pervasive computing is constantly at the forefront of mobile systems research, and has found its way into many commercial systems due to tremendous advances in a broad spectrum of technologies and topics such as wireless networking, mobile and distributed computing, sensor systems, ambient intelligence, and smart devices.  
 IEEE Percom 2023 will be held in person. Remote presentations and pre-recorded videos are not allowed unless all authors of an accepted paper are under special circumstances that prevent them from attending the conference in person. Requests for such exceptions will be considered carefully by the organizing committees. We are sympathetic to concerns and sentiments about our in-person focus. We will fully accommodate remote authors/speakers if they have Visa-related travel issues or COVID/health-related travel issues.
