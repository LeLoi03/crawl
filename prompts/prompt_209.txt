  About MobiQuitous 2023   
 Despite the considerable research effort in the area of Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing over the nearly two decades, and the maturity of some of its base technologies, many challenges persist. The goal of the eighteenth annual International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Computing, Networking and Services (MobiQuitous 2023) is to provide a forum for presenting and discussing high-quality research in the field, involving international practitioners and researchers from diverse backgrounds. MobiQuitous 2023 will thus foster research collaboration through focused discussions, interaction and exchange of experiences that will designate future research efforts and directions. Areas addressed by the conference include systems, applications, social networks, middleware, networking, sensing, data management, data processing and services, all with special focus on mobile and ubiquitous computing.

5. MobiSPC_0 conference:
The 20th International Conference on Mobile Systems and Pervasive Computing  
  August 14-16, 2023, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada   
   to MobiSPC 2023 that will be held in conjunction with  
   The 18th International Conference on Future Networks and Communications (FNC)   
 Mobile Systems and Pervasive Computing (MobiSPC) have evolved into an active area of research and development. This is due to the tremendous advances in a broad spectrum of technologies and topics, including wireless networking, mobile and distributed computing, sensor systems, RFID technology, and the ubiquitous mobile phone. MobiSPC-2023 solicits papers that focus on the theory, systems, practices and challenges of providing users with a successful mobile or wireless experience. This includes how mobile computing changes how people pervasively use their computers, computing resources and applications, as well the systems, services and technology enabling those applications.  
 MobiSPC 2023 will provide a leading edge, scholarly forum for researchers, engineers, and students alike to share their state-of-the art research and developmental work in the broad areas of pervasive computing and communications. The MobiSPC-2023 will be held in conjunction with The 18th International Conference on Future Networks and Communications (FNC 2023).    
 MobiSPC 2023 will be held in Halifax Nova Scotia, Canada. Halifax is located on the east coast of Canada and is approximately a 6-hour flight from London, UK and a 2-hour flight from Toronto, Ontario. Halifax is a vibrant and modern city which is home to multiple academic institutions and where visitors can enjoy a variety of activities and entertainment from whale watching to Jazz festivals to world-class cuisine. Halifax is also home to the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic which contains the world largest collection of Titanic artifacts. Nova Scotia is a picturesque province with many National and Provincial parks, and as stated in the Guinness Book of World Records, has the highest tides in the world.

 What is it about?  Research in networks and communication technologies requires very significant investments of stakeholders for enabling our future networking society. Research in network communication has made several possible innovations having a strong influence on people's lives. Mobile communications and the Internet are two outstanding examples. Future Networks and Communications technologies, including mobile broadband and all optical networks are the key to the ground-breaking inventions to our future technologies. It will enable us to design and build the future communication infrastructure interconnecting and empowering the next generation enabling platforms.  
 While the technology itself develops faster and faster, the deployment and implementation of a new network infrastructure technology can take up to ten years. The future networks communication research will deliver the next generation of network technologies enabling smart connectivity for all, anywhere, and at any time at the highest speed and efficiency so as to meet the overwhelming demand by today's society. This is why we need to enable a very reliable and dependable future networks and communication to ensure that industries; businesses and consumers can access and use the most advanced content and services they call for.
