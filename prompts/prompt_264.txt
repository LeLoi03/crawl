  Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on New Trends in Intelligent Software Methodologies, Tools and Techniques (SoMeT_23)   
 Software is an essential enabler for science and the new economy, but current software methodologies, tools, and techniques are often still not sufficiently robust or reliable for the constantly changing and evolving market, and many promising approaches have proved to be no more than case-oriented methods that are not fully automated.  
 This book presents the proceedings of SoMeT_23, the 22nd International Conference on New Trends in Intelligent Software Methodology, Tools, and Techniques, held from 20–22 September 2023 in Naples, Italy. The conference brings together researchers and practitioners to share original research and practical development experience in software science and related new technologies, and is an opportunity for the software-science community to take stock of where they are today and consider future directions. The 25 papers included here were carefully selected from the many high-quality submissions received after a rigorous review process, with each paper typically being reviewed by 3 or 4 reviewers. Topics covered range from research practices, techniques and methodologies to the solutions required by global business. SoMeT_23 focused in particular on intelligent software, the application of artificial intelligence techniques in software development, and tackling human interaction in the development process for better high-level interface, with an emphasis on human-centric software methodologies, end-user development techniques, and emotional reasoning for an optimum performance between design tool and user.  
 Exploring trends, theories, and challenges in the integration of software and science for tomorrow’s global information society, the book captures a new state-of-the-art in software science and its supporting technology and will be of interest to all those working in the field.

  The Case for Collaboration (Everything a Systems Person really needs to know about Machine Learning)   
  It's 2023, and the answer to every system performance or optimization problem is "machine learning." But what kinds of models are appropriate for these applications? I'm going to try to convince you that, as in good system design, "simpler is better." And, in this case, simpler has many benefits: simpler models are typically more efficient in both space and time, they are frequently transparently interpretable, and they produce accuracy and generalization equivalent to the fanciest deep learning model you can build.
