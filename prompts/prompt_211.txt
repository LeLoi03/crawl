  Bali Calling: Paper Accepted for MoMM2023  
 Monday, 27 November 2023 • Santiago Berrezueta   
  We are thrilled to share that our research paper has been accepted at the 21st International Conference on Advances in Mobile Computing & Multimedia Intelligence (MoMM 2023)   in Bali, Indonesia.  
  21st International Conference on Advances in Mobile Computing & Multimedia Intelligence      
 Our latest research paper introduces a transformative mobile application designed to support the occupational therapy for children with ADHD. This app, part of a comprehensive smart-home environment, enables therapists and parents to remotely observe and interact with children during therapy sessions.  
 Key Findings:   
 Enhanced Monitoring: The app provides real-time behavioral tracking, offering detailed insights into children’s actions during therapy tasks. This facilitates more informed therapeutic decisions and timely adjustments, including medication management.

 Modeling and Optimization: Theory and Applications (MOPTA)  aims at bringing together a diverse group of people from both discrete and continuous optimization, working on both theoretical and applied aspects. There will be a small number of invited talks from distinguished speakers and contributed talks, spread over three days. Our target is to present a diverse set of exciting new developments from different optimization areas while at the same time providing a setting which will allow increased interaction among the participants. We aim to bring together researchers from both the theoretical and applied communities who do not usually have the chance to interact in the framework of a medium-scale event.  
 Announcement  
 For access to Rauch Business Center (RBC) and Lamberton Hall during the MOPTA 2023 Conference, please follow these guidelines:  
  If the secondary entrance door of Rauch Business Center is locked  and you do not have your access card  , please scan the QR code below or use the green link below to receive the email address to contact for access to the building.
