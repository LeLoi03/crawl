  The annual conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA) is the premier international event for interdisciplinary research on the design, application, and evaluation of Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVAs) with a specific focus on the ability to socially interact. IVAs are interactive characters that exhibit human-like qualities including communicating using natural human modalities such as facial expressions, speech, and gesture. They are capable of real-time perception, cognition, emotion and action that allow them to participate in dynamic social environments.

 The annual ACM Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA) is the premier international event for interdisciplinary research on the development, application, and evaluation of Intelligent Virtual Agents with the specific focus on the ability to socially interact. Such agents can be embodied graphically (e.g. virtual characters, embodied conversational agents) or physically (e.g. robots). They are capable of real-time perception, cognition, emotion and action allowing them to participate in dynamic social environments. This includes human-like interaction qualities such as multimodal communication using facial expressions, speech, and gesture, conversational interaction, socially assistive and affective interaction, interactive task-oriented cooperation, or social behaviour simulation. IVAs are highly relevant and widely applied in many important domains including health, tutoring, training, games, or assisted living.  
 We invite submissions of research on a broad range of topics, including but not limited to: theoretical foundations of intelligent virtual agents, agent and interactive behaviour modelling, evaluation, agents in simulations, games, and other applications. Please see the detailed list of topics below.  
 VENUE   
 IVA is targeted to be an in-person conference. In case of extraordinary circumstances, such as visa problems or health issues, video presentation will be possible. However, there is no digital or hybrid conference system planned, thus it is not possible to attend this year’s IVA conference remotely.  
 IMPORTANT DATES   
 Abstract submission: April 14, 2023 (only for Full Papers and Extended Abstracts)  
  All papers submission: April 18, 2023  April 28, 2023  
  Workshop proposal submission: April 21, 2023  
  Review notification / start of rebuttal: June 6, 2023  
  End of rebuttal: June 10, 2023  
  Notification of acceptance: June 23, 2023  
  Doctoral Consortium submission: July 1, 2023  
  Camera ready deadline: July 18, 2023  
  Conference: September 19-22, 2023  
 All deadlines are anywhere on earth (UTC−12)  
 TYPES OF SUBMISSION   
 Full Papers  (7 pages + references):  
  Full papers should present significant, novel, and substantial work of high quality.  
  Demos submissions focus on implemented systems and should contain a link to a video of the system with a maximum length of 5 minutes.  
 All submissions will be double-blind peer-reviewed by a group of external expert reviewers. All accepted submissions will be published in the ACM proceedings.  
 Accepted full papers will be presented either in oral sessions or as posters during the conference (depending on the nature of the contribution), extended abstracts will be presented as posters, and demos will be showcased in dedicated sessions during the conference. For each accepted contribution, at least one of the authors must register for the conference.  
 IVA 2023 will also feature workshops  and a doctoral consortium  .  
 TRACKS   
 For full paper submissions, IVA will have different paper tracks with different review criteria. Authors need to indicate which one of the following tracks they want to submit their paper to:  
 1. Empirical Studies  
  Criteria: methodology, theoretical foundation, originality of result etc.  
  Criteria: innovation of the application, societal relevance, evaluation of effects, etc.  
 SCOPE AND LIST OF TOPICS   
 IVA invites submissions on a broad range of topics, including but not limited to:  
 AGENT DESIGN AND MODELING:  
 Cognition (e.g. task, social, other) 
  Migration between platforms 
  SPECIAL SESSION   
 In addition to the traditional IVA topics, this year’s conference plans a special session on “IVAs in future mixed realities”, e.g., in social VR and potential incarnations of a Metaverse. Immersive and potentially distributed artificial virtual worlds provide new forms of full-size embodied human-human interaction via avatars of arbitrary looks, enabling interesting intra- and interpersonal effects. They also enable hybrid avatar-agent interactions between humans and A.I.s, unlocking the full potential of non-verbal behavior in digital face-to-face encounters, significantly enhancing the design space for IVAs to assist, guide, help but also to persuade and affect interacting users. We welcome all kinds of novel research on technological, psychological, and sociological determinants of such immersive digital avatar-agent encounters for this special session.  
 INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS   
 All papers need to be submitted in PDF-format.  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs  from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 This event is sponsored by SIGAI.

Abstract  
 Understanding protein structures is a crucial step in creating molecular insight for researchers as well as students and pupils. The enormous scaling gap between an atomic point of view and objects in daily life hampers developing an intuitive relation between them. Especially for high school students, it can be dif?cult to understand the spatial relations of a protein structure. Due to lack of direct imaging techniques, molecules can only be explored by studying abstract molecular models. Here, the use of Augmented reality (AR) techniques has proven to strongly improve structural perception. In this work we present ProteinScanAR, an augmented reality framework for biomolecular education that allows connecting virtual and real worlds intuitively, and thus enables focusing on the scienti?c or educational content. Special attention was taken to guarantee implementational and technical requirements as general and simple as possible to alleviate application in non-expert computer settings. The Protein-ScanAR framework is freely available under the GNU Public License (GPL).
