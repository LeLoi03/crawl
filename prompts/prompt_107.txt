 Conference Description  
 The Visualization in Science and Education GRC is a premier, international scientific conference focused on advancing the frontiers of science through the presentation of cutting-edge and unpublished research, prioritizing time for discussion after each talk and fostering informal interactions among scientists of all career stages. The conference program includes a diverse range of speakers and discussion leaders from institutions and organizations worldwide, concentrating on the latest developments in the field. The conference is five days long and held in a remote location to increase the sense of camaraderie and create scientific communities, with lasting collaborations and friendships. In addition to premier talks, the conference has designated time for poster sessions from individuals of all career stages, and afternoon free time and communal meals allow for informal networking opportunities with leaders in the field.  
 The 2023 Gordon Research Conference on Visualization in Science and Education will continue the tradition of bringing together a multi-disciplinary group including researchers from the social and natural sciences, artists, technologists, journalists, educators from formal and informal settings, and others engaged in the production, study, and application of visualizations to advance and promote scientific understanding. The theme for the 2023 conference is "Visualizing Complex Systems", which will involve exploration of multi-dimensional topics such as climate change, epidemics, Indigenous knowledge systems, and social justice. The Gordon Research Conference offers an ideal format for exploring such topics due to its residential setting and highly collaborative atmosphere that promotes discovery of new intersections between fields. Mini grants are provided to support further development of collaborations that emerge in the meeting.  
 In the 2023 Gordon Research Conference on Visualization in Science and Education, speakers will apply technical, ethical, artistic, scientific, educational and philosophical lenses to how visualizations can clarify or intensify the uncertainty inherent in natural, engineered, social, biological (and hybrids of all these) systems. We will also consider how the mind understands systems and how visualizations support or obstruct mental systems-model building. We will apply the collective wisdom of speakers and participants to understand how visualizations can support both scientific analysis and public decision making around pressing socio-scientific issues.  
 Due to limited accommodations at this venue, guest housing is very limited. To request family/guest housing please reach out to your Conference Operations Associate.   
 Conference Program  
  The GRC Power Hour™ is designed to address diversity and inclusion in the scientific workplace by providing a safe environment for informal and meaningful conversations amongst colleagues of all career stages. The program supports the professional growth of all members of our communities, including ethnicity, race and/or gender identity by providing an open forum for discussion and mentoring.  Organizers: Kevin Wee  (Independent, United States) and Russanne Low  (IGES, United States)

 SUBMISSION DETAILS   
 Online submission: | PCS Submission System 
  Template: | ACM Master Article Submission Templates (single column) 
  Submission format: | A proposal including references (maximum 5-pages) and mandatory supplementary material describing the SIG (2-pages). 
  Selection Process: | Juried 
  How have other academic communities engaged with the topic of your SIG?  The SIG Proposal (5-pages) should clearly articulate a compelling reason for the SIG. Authors are strongly encouraged to describe the topic in a maximum of 20 primary references with approximately half of the references coming from ACM publications and the other half from sources beyond the ACM. This is not a hard rule as much as it is a challenge to seek out interdisciplinary opportunities for collaboration.  
 Develop the proposal collaboratively with a group of people  . While not strictly required, we prefer that proposals be authored by a minimum of two individuals representing at least two different organizations or communities.  
 The following details about the SIG session should be included in the Supplementary Material: (1) A brief description of the community (or communities) to which this SIG would be of interest and why it is of interest, (2) assumed attendee background, (3) the approach you will use for organizing and presenting the SIG, (4) an informal schedule of discussion topics, (5) your plan to attract a reasonable number of attendees, and (6) which organizer should serve as the primary contact.  
 As you develop a plan for your SIG proposal, please pay attention to accessibility considerations. Follow recommendations found in the Guide to an Accessible Submission  . If you have any questions or concerns about creating accessible submissions, please contact the Accessibility Chairs at accessibility2023@cscw.acm.org  .  
 Deadline for submissions due: | Thursday, May 11, 2023 
  Notification of acceptance: | Thursday, June 15, 2023 
  Camera-ready submissions: | Thursday, July 6, 2023 
  * UPDATE (05-11-2023):  Please contact the SIG chairs about late submissions ( sigs2023@cscw.acm.org  )  
 SELECTION PROCESS   
 Although the process is highly selective, it does not necessarily follow a reviewing process by a committee, and authors should not expect to receive formal feedback on their submission other than the selection decision. Specifically, we will consider the following criteria:  
 Appeal to the community: | Is the topic both timely and of wide enough appeal to attract a significant audience? At the same time, is the topic sufficiently focused to allow for productive discussion during the SIG meeting? Too narrow, and the SIG might attract too few people; too broad, and it is difficult for progress to be made in the relatively short duration of a SIG. 
  Format: | Is the proposed format conducive to discussion and shared insight? Will it be possible to achieve its aims? SIGs are not workshops, nor project showcases, nor tutorials. 
  Diversity of perspective: | It helps to be able to show that the SIG will be able to encompass a wide perspective, and that the organizers can accommodate and facilitate discussion across this breadth. Places to show this are in the description of the intended community, the assumed attendee background, and the home institutions and disciplines of the organizers. 
  Continuity: | Does the SIG support the development of a longer term interest group, for example follow-on SIGs or other types of contributions at subsequent CSCW and other conferences? If the topic is a very recent or new one, or a revival of an old topic, then arguments will need to be made, to demonstrate that it is a topic that will persist, rather than simply being this year’s fashion. If the topic is a continuation of previous SIG(s), then it is necessary to present the latest developments of the topic and their projection into the future. 
  Anonymity: | Submissions should not contain sensitive, private, or proprietary information that cannot be disclosed at publication time. Submissions should NOT be anonymous. However, confidentiality of submissions will be maintained during the review process. All rejected submissions will be kept confidential in perpetuity. All submitted materials for accepted submissions will be kept confidential until the start of the conference, with the exception of title and author information which will be published on the website prior to the conference. 
  UPON ACCEPTANCE OF YOUR SUBMISSION   
 The corresponding author of a conditionally accepted paper has to follow the instructions on preparing and submitting a final version by the Publication-Ready Deadline. If the authors cannot meet these requirements by the Publication-Ready deadline, the venue chairs will be notified and may be required to remove the paper from the program. The publication-ready version has to follow the LaTeX and Word templates from ACM. Should you need technical assistance, please direct your technical query to: pubs2023@cscw.acm.org  .  
 A message from the SIG Co-Chairs:   
 A SIG meeting can be an exciting opportunity to spark new directions in research. SIG sessions are different from a conference Panel, in that panels tend to be facilitated question-and-answer sessions with expert discussants. By contrast, the purpose of a SIG is to advance the understanding and community around specific areas of interest. SIG sessions may seed research papers, grant proposals, new conferences, and so on.  
 As this will be the first time CSCW has offered SIG sessions, we encourage you to consider examples of accepted SIG abstracts from other conferences, available for download from the ACM Digital Library. The following are several from CHI 2022 (New Orleans):

 ACM International Conference on Supporting Group Work (GROUP)*  
 Monthly Featured   
 The biennial ACM International Conference on Supporting Group Work (GROUP)  , supported by the Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Group on Human-Computer Interaction (ACM SIGHCI), formerly the ACM SIGGROUP Conference on Supporting Group Work (GROUP), the Conference on Organizational Computing Systems (COOCS), and the ACM SIGOIS (and IEEE CS TC-OA) Conference on Office Information Systems (COCS), is a premier venue for research on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, Human Computer Interaction, Computer Supported Collaborative Learning and Socio-Technical Studies. A strong emphasis of GROUP conferences is to foster a discourse on collaborative technology that bridges the fields of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Information Systems (IS), Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL), and “Learning at the workplace” (CSCL@Work). Relevant issues include the design, implementation, deployment, evaluation, and impact of these systems as well as examinations of relevant research methodologies. The conference integrates work in social science, computer science, engineering, design, values, and other diverse topics related to group work, broadly conceptualized.
