 About PSIVT 2023  
  PSIVT 2023  marks the 11th edition of the Pacific-Rim Symposium on Image and Video Technology, a conference that gathers researchers and practitioners from around the globe to discuss the latest breakthroughs in image and video processing, analysis, and applications. This year's symposium is proudly taking place in Auckland, New Zealand  , a city celebrated for its natural beauty, cultural diversity, and welcoming atmosphere.  
 Over the years, PSIVT has been held in various cities across the Pacific Rim, including Sydney, Australia; Wuhan, China; Guanajuato, Mexico; Singapore; Gwangju, South Korea; Tokyo, Japan; Santiago, Chile; and Hsinchu, Taiwan. The rich history of this symposium highlights its importance and continued relevance to the field of image and video technology.  
 Auckland  , often referred to as the "City of Sails" due to its thriving waterfront and sailing culture, is the largest city in New Zealand. It is renowned for its scenic landscapes, including stunning beaches, lush rainforests, and dormant volcanic cones. As a top tourist destination, Auckland offers a multitude of attractions, outdoor adventures, and world-class cuisine that cater to a wide range of interests and preferences.  
 The conference is organized by the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering  within the School of Engineering, Computer, and Mathematical Sciences (ECMS) at Auckland University of Technology (AUT)  . AUT is a leading higher education institution in New Zealand, dedicated to fostering innovation, creativity, and academic excellence. The ECMS school, recognized for its cutting-edge research and teaching, provides an outstanding platform for interdisciplinary collaboration, connecting experts from various fields to develop pioneering solutions in image and video technology.

 IEEE Quantum Week  — the IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE)  — is bridging the gap between the science of quantum computing and the development of an industry surrounding it. As such, this event brings a perspective to the quantum industry different from academic or business conferences. IEEE Quantum Week is a multidisciplinary quantum computing and engineering venue that gives attendees the unique opportunity to discuss challenges and opportunities with quantum researchers, scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, developers, students, practitioners, educators, programmers, and newcomers.  
 QCE23 will be held as an  in-person event with virtual participation in Bellevue, Washington, USA  at the  Hyatt Regency Bellevue on Seattle’s Eastside   .  After three highly successful IEEE Quantum Week events, w  e are eager to develop an oustanding conference program with  live exhibits, world-class keynote speakers, technical papers, community building workshops,  workforce-building tutorials  , stimulating panels, innovative posters, thought-provoking Birds of Feather (BoF) sessions, networking, sessions. Attend in-person for the full conference experience!  Virtual registration options are available for those who are unable to travel to Bellevue, Washington, USA.    
 With your contributions and support, together we are building a wonderful premier meeting of quantum minds to help advance the fields of quantum computing and engineering.
