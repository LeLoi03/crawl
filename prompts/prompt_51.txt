 Registration for CORL 2023 is now open!  
  US Visa Invitation:   Due to the time it takes to process US visa applications, we encourage all international attendees needing a visa to register as early as possible. Note, you must register for in-person attendance for the visa invitation letter to be valid. We will refund the cost of the registration if the visa application is denied, as well as any cancellations made by September 10th. The visa invitation letter will be sent to you by email within 2 business days of registration.  
 Author Registration :   At least one author from each accepted paper must be registered to attend in person. Authors of accepted oral papers must attend in person for the oral presentation to remain on the schedule, otherwise the paper presentation format will be altered to a poster.  
 Virtual Attendance:   We are offering the opportunity for virtual attendance of CoRL 2023 at a reduced rate. However, note that virtual participation will be very limited. Specifically:  
 Virtual attendees will be able to watch talks live, as well as potentially contribute questions to the speaker. 
  Virtual attendees will NOT be able to present talks or posters. 
 FAQs  
 We suggest all CoRL 2023 attendees to avail early registration rates. Due to the long processing time in US visa applications, we encourage all potential attendees needing a visa to register early and start a visa application before paper decisions.   
 Kindly note, you must register for in-person attendance for the visa invitation letter to be valid. The visa invitation letter will be sent to you by email within 2 business days of registration.  
 General Cancellation Policy   
 Before Sept 11 midnight EST:  Complete Refund 
  After Oct 1, 2023:  No refund for cancellation. 
  Oct 1, 2023 - Oct 31, 2023:  Special Requests to convert to virtual registration in case of visa delays with documentary evidence. 
 How to request registration cancellation?   
 Please request cancellation via this form    before Sept 10  .  
 What if I register early, but my paper is rejected?   
 You will have the option to:  
 attend in-person (keep your registration), 
  attend virtually (convert registration to virtual only) for a partial refund, or 
  cancel your registration. 
  You will need to make a decision within 10 days of the paper notification deadline in case a complete refund is desired. (Date: Sept 11, 2023  ).  
 What if I register early and have an accepted paper, but my visa is rejected or delayed?   
 All accepted papers need a corresponding registration for publication in the CoRL proceedings. In case physical attendance is not possible for any of the authors, you may convert to a virtual attendee registration.  
  A partial refund of the difference in the registration costs between virtual and in-person will be issued. Kindly note that a proof of visa denial/delay will be required for the partial refund and all such requests must be submitted before Oct 31, 2023  .  
 Is the registration transferable?   
  However, in case of visa issues, or extenuating circumstances, please contact chernova@gatech.edu.

 About CPAIOR    
 The aim of the CPAIOR conference series is to bring together interested researchers from Constraint Programming (CP), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Operations Research (OR) to present new techniques or new applications, and to provide an opportunity for researchers in one area to learn about techniques in the others. A main objective of this conference series is to give researchers the opportunity to show how the integration of techniques from different fields can lead to interesting results on large and complex problems.   
 Typically, papers presented at CPAIOR actively combine, integrate, or contrast approaches from more than one of the areas. High quality papers from a single area are usually also welcome. Finally, application papers showcasing CP/AI/OR techniques on innovative and challenging applications or experience reports on such applications have been strongly encouraged.   
 Proceedings of this peer-reviewed conference are published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. In some cases, a selection of papers is published in a special issue of a journal after another round of reviewing. This has been standardized in recent years via a Journal Fast-Track reviewing process.
