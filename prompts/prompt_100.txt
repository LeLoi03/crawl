 tl;dr  : - "at-conference" proceedings (not "post-conference") via ACM - all presentations will be poster presentations - double blind reviewing - submission deadline: May 4  , 2023 (anywhere on earth) - page limit is 12 in a double column format, references included - ORCID required for camera-ready submission for all authors   Call for Papers  
  The FOGA series aims at advancing our understanding of the working principles behind evolutionary algorithms and related randomized search heuristics, such as local search algorithms, differential evolution, ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, artificial immune systems, simulated annealing, and other Monte Carlo methods for search and optimization. Connections to related areas, such as Bayesian optimization and direct search, are of interest as well.  
  FOGA is the premier event to discuss advances on the theoretical foundations of these algorithms, tools needed to analyze them, and different aspects of comparing algorithms’ performance. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Run time analysis 
  Mathematical tools suitable for the analysis of search heuristics 
  Submissions covering the entire spectrum of work, ranging from rigorously derived mathematical results to carefully crafted empirical studies, are invited.

 SESSION: Keynote  
  Evolutionary computation methods are successfully applied to solve a broad range of industrial and academic optimization problems. Most of these problems are far too complex to be analyzed analytically. Runtime analysis, a central topic in the theory of evolutionary computation, is therefore typically restricted to structurally simple artificial optimization tasks. In this presentation, I will discuss various ways in which we can nevertheless "bridge the gap" between theory and practice in evolutionary computation.

 Rigorous Runtime Analysis of Diversity Optimization with GSEMO on OneMinMax   
 Denis Antipov 
  Aneta Neumann 
  Frank Neumann 
  The evolutionary diversity optimization aims at finding a diverse set of solutions which satisfy some constraint on their fitness. In the context of multi-objective optimization this constraint can require solutions to be Pareto-optimal. In this paper we study how the GSEMO algorithm with additional diversity-enhancing heuristic optimizes a diversity of its population on a bi-objective benchmark problem OneMinMax, for which all solutions are Pareto-optimal. We provide a rigorous runtime analysis of the last step of the optimization, when the algorithm starts with a population with a second-best diversity, and prove that it finds a population with optimal diversity in expected time O(n2), when the problem size n is odd. For reaching our goal, we analyse the random walk of the population, which reflects the frequency of changes in the population and their outcomes.  
 Curing ill-Conditionality via Representation-Agnostic Distance-Driven Perturbations   
  Andrew M. Sutton 
  Xiankun Yan 
  Randomized search heuristics can sometimes be effective verifiers for combinatorial conjectures. In this paper, we demonstrate how a simple evolutionary algorithm can be used to confirm the antimagic tree conjecture for all trees up to order 25. This conjecture, which has been open for over thirty years, is that every tree except K2 has an antimagic labeling: a bijective edge labeling such that the sum of labels assigned to edges incident to a vertex v is unique for all vertices v ϵ V. Moreover, we formally prove that that simple evolutionary algorithms are guaranteed to find antimagic labelings in expected polynomial time on trees of any order for certain restricted classes (paths, combs, uniform caterpillars, uniform spiders and perfect binary trees).  
 Using Automated Algorithm Configuration for Parameter Control   
 Per Kristian Lehre 
  Xiaoyu Qin 
  Real-world optimisation often involves uncertainty. Previous studies proved that evolutionary algorithms (EAs) can be robust to noise when using proper parameter settings, including the mutation rate. However, finding the appropriate mutation rate is challenging if the occurrence of noise (or noise level) is unknown. Self-adaptation is a parameter control mechanism which adjusts mutation rates by encoding mutation rates in the genomes of individuals and evolving them. It has been proven to be effective in optimising unknown-structure and multi-modal problems. Despite this, a rigorous study of self-adaptation in noisy optimisation is missing. This paper mathematically analyses the runtimes of 2-tournament EAs with self-adapting two mutation rates, fixed mutation rates and uniformly chosen mutation rate from two given rates on LeadingOnes with and without symmetric noise. Results show that using self-adaptation achieves the lowest runtime regardless of the presence of symmetric noise. In supplemental experiments, we extend analyses to other types of noise, i.e., one-bit and bit-wise noise. We also consider another self-adaptation mechanism, which adapts the mutation rate from a given interval. Self-adaptive EAs adapt their mutation rate to the noise level and outperform static EAs in these experiments. Overall, self-adaptation can improve the noise-tolerance of EAs in the noise-models studied here.  
 Convergence Properties of the (μ/μI, λ)-ES on the Rastrigin Function   
  Olaf Mersmann 
  Artificial benchmark functions are commonly used in optimization research because of their ability to rapidly evaluate potential solutions, making them a preferred substitute for real-world problems. However, these benchmark functions have faced criticism for their limited resemblance to real-world problems. In response, recent research has focused on automatically generating new benchmark functions for areas where established test suites are inadequate. These approaches have limitations, such as the difficulty of generating new benchmark functions that exhibit exploratory landscape analysis (ELA) features beyond those of existing benchmarks.  
 The objective of this work is to develop a method for generating benchmark functions for single-objective continuous optimization with user-specified structural properties. Specifically, we aim to demonstrate a proof of concept for a method that uses an ELA feature vector to specify these properties in advance. To achieve this, we begin by generating a random sample of decision space variables and objective values. We then adjust the objective values using CMA-ES until the corresponding features of our new problem match the predefined ELA features within a specified threshold. By iteratively transforming the landscape in this way, we ensure that the resulting function exhibits the desired properties. To create the final function, we use the resulting point cloud as training data for a simple neural network that produces a function exhibiting the target ELA features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by replicating the existing functions of the well-known BBOB suite and creating new functions with ELA feature values that are not present in BBOB.

 Paper Submission  
 Submission  
 This year, FOGA will use the “linklings” submission management system. This system is also used by GECCO, but note that a separate account will be required to submit papers to FOGA.  
 Link to the Linklings submission page: Linklings   
 Paper Format  
 Authors should submit their papers consistent with the alternate 2-column ACM SIG style file “sigconf”  (see www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template  to obtain the class file and see templates) by the submission deadline (May 4, 2023). Authors are required to submit their electronic papers in PDF format. The maximum number of pages is 12, including references, but we encourage authors to make a concise and significant contribution in fewer pages. Over-length papers will be rejected without review. On the other hand, you are welcome to provide supplementary material, for instance, full proofs, additional figures or examples. Note, however, that reviewers won’t be required to look at this supplemental material, and that your paper should be self-contained. The proceedings will be published by ACM Press and will be finalized before the conference starts (in contrast to previous years there are “at-conference” instead of “post-conference” proceedings). Instructions for the camera-ready papers (deadline on July 6  July 13, 2023) will be made available in due time.  
 Review Process  
 The review process is double blind  . Therefore, in order to make blind reviewing possible, authors must omit their names and affiliations from the paper and must take measures to ensure that your identity is not easily revealed from the submission itself. Please refer to your prior work in a neutral manner (i.e., instead of saying “We showed” say “XYZ et al. showed”). It is acceptable to submit work that has been presented in public or has appeared on ArXiV, provided the submission itself is anonymized. Similarly, reviewers should not reveal their identities within the paper reviews. Selection criteria include originality of ideas, correctness, clarity, significance of results and quality of presentation. The review process will include a rebuttal opportunity for authors to see the reviews of their papers and to respond to technical questions raised by the reviewers before discussion starts within the Program Committee. The decision of the Program Committee will be final and cannot be appealed.

  Definition and scope  
 The FOIS conference is a meeting point for all researchers with an interest in formal ontology. Formal ontology is the systematic study of the types of entities and relations making up the domains of interest represented in modern information systems. The conference encourages submission of high quality, not previously published results on both theoretical issues and practical advancements. FOIS 2023 will have distinct tracks for foundational issues  , ontology applications and methods  , and domain ontologies  .  
 FOIS aims to be a nexus of interdisciplinary research and communication for researchers from many domains engaging with formal ontology. Common application areas include conceptual modeling, database design, knowledge engineering and management, software engineering, organizational modeling, artificial intelligence, robotics, computational linguistics, the life sciences, bioinformatics and scientific research in general, geographic information science, information retrieval, library and information science, as well as the Semantic Web.  
 FOIS is the flagship conference of the International Association for Ontology and its Applications (IAOA  ), which is a non-profit organization promoting interdisciplinary research and international collaboration in formal ontology.  
 Important dates  
 Authors must submit an abstract by: January 31, 2023 (AoE) 
  The full papers are due (extended): February 12, 2023 (AoE) 
  Author rebuttal period | : March 24-31, 2023 (tentative) 
  Notifications: | April 10, 2023 (tentative) 
  Camera-ready papers: | May 1, 2023 
  Onsite conference: | July 17-20, 2023 
  Virtual conference: | week of September 18, 2023 
  The submission deadline for workshops will be after the notifications to allow authors to submit a revised version of rejected papers to any of the conference workshops if the paper topics are appropriate for this workshop.  
 Location  
 FOIS 2023 will consist of a physical meeting and a virtual meeting:  
 An in-person only meeting in Sherbrooke, Québec from July 17 to 20, 2023 that will be very much like a traditional conference with keynotes, regular talks, workshops and tutorials and plenty of social and networking opportunities. This part will not have a remote participation option, but we plan on recording selected talks (e.g. keynotes). 
  This will be followed by an online part to be held from September 18 to 20, 2023 that offers an opportunity for presentation and discussion of additional papers that were not presented at the physical meeting in Sherbrooke. 
  To plan for this two-part event, authors must at the time of submission indicate their preference and constraints for presenting either on site in Sherbrooke or virtually  . Acceptance will be either for in-person presentation or for online presentation, at which time authors can no longer change the modality. Since the numbers of in-person and online presentations are limited, we encourage authors to be as flexible as possible to maximize your chance of paper acceptance. More details are provided in the Submission Instructions  (see below).  
 Submissions  
 FOIS 2023 seeks three types of full-length (14 pages) high-quality papers on a wide range of topics:  
 Foundational | papers address content-related ontological issues, their formal representation, and their relevance to some aspect of information systems. 
  Application | and | Methods | papers address novel systems, methods, and tools related to building, evaluating, or using ontologies, emphasizing the impact of ontology contents. 
  Domain ontology | papers describe a novel ontology for a specific realm of interest, clarifying ontological choices against requirements and foundational theory, and showing ontology use. 
  Please refer to the Submissions Instructions  for more details. As usual, the FOIS proceedings will be published by IOS Press.  
 The conference will also offer workshops and tutorials related to formal ontologies. See the separate Call for Workshops and Tutorials Proposals  for more information.  
 Topics of interest  
 Areas of particular interest to FOIS include the following:  
 Foundational Issues   
 Kinds of entities: particulars/universals, continuants/occurrents, abstracta/concreta, dependent entities/independent entities, natural objects/artifacts, events/processes 
  Ontology of artifacts, functions, capacities and roles 
  Ontology of social reality (institutions, organizations, norms, social relationships, artistic expressions, etc.) 
  Submission Instructions  
  Each submission must put the track (see below) as the first keyword, followed by other keywords specific to the paper. 
  For each paper, authors must indicate their presentation preference as per the instructions below. 
  Authors are limited to a maximum of two first-authored submissions, with no limit to the number of co-authored submissions. Any individual may present no more than two accepted papers. 
  Paper format requirements  
 Submitted papers must not exceed 14 pages (including bibliography). 
  Reviewing Process  
 Each paper will be assigned at least 3 reviewers. All reviews will be anonymous. The authors will have a chance to respond to the initial reviews during the rebuttal phase. This phase gives authors a chance to correct or clarify any factual knowledge in the reviews and to address any specific questions that reviewers may have.  
  Submission and Review Criteria for the Foundations Track   
 Scope: | foundational papers address content-related ontological issues, their formal representation, and their relevance to some aspect of information systems. Foundational papers may explore domain general ontological topics (e.g., mereology) or be concerned with general categories (e.g., papers on upper ontologies). Papers concerned with the philosophical, logical or mathematical foundations of applied ontology are also included in this track. 
  Review criteria: | will consider (1) the significance and clarity of the problem statement; (2) the novelty and weight of the ontological / philosophical / logical / mathematical analysis; (3) the soundness of any formalism, (4) the relevance to some aspect of information systems; and (5) the adequate satisfaction of issues or requirements from the problem statement. If the paper contains theorems without proofs, the proofs should be made available to reviewers as an appendix to the paper. The page limit will not be applied to this appendix, and the appendix will not be included in the final publication. 
   Submission and Review Criteria for the Applications and Methods Track   
 Scope: | papers in this track address novel methods, systems and tools related to building, evaluating, or using ontologies, emphasizing the impact of ontology contents on the application. If a paper is about how ontologies are used in some computational system, such as for recommendation, semantic search, or machine learning, or if it is about new methods or tools that, for example, help design, evaluate, modularize, or compare ontologies, then it belongs in this track. 
  Review criteria: | will follow typical computer science criteria, including the novelty, significance and soundness of the work as evident in the problem statement and requirements, the related work, as well as the methodology and evaluation, with evaluation typically including implementation, results, and analysis. 
   Submission and Review Criteria for the Domain Ontology Track   
 Scope: | domain ontology papers describe a novel ontology for a specific realm of interest. The goal is | not | just to reproduce the content of the ontology in some abbreviated form, but to provide added value enabling a reader to better understand and use the ontology. Hence, the paper should focus on providing: (1) background information and an overview of contents (e.g., motivation, domain, scope, requirements, ontology language, modularity, statistical information); (2) a comparison with related ontologies to highlight differences and benefits; (3) a description of methodology and ontology design choices; (4) an evaluation of the ontology against requirements and possibly foundational theory, and (5) discussion of actual or potential use. Moreover, all ontologies discussed in the paper should be accessible to reviewers. 
  Review criteria: | will consider the novelty, significance, and soundness of the required elements (just listed above). 
  Presentation preferences  
 When submitting a paper, you must indicate your availability to present the paper in-person or online, choosing one of the following options:  
 (1) Only in-person (not willing or able to present online) 
  (2) Prefer in-person presentation but will present online if asked to do so 
  (4) Prefer online presentation but will present in-person if asked to do so 
  (5) Only online (not willing or able to present in-person) 
  Note that if you select any of (2)-(4), this will not have any impact on the acceptance decision as we reserve the right to assign papers with such preferences for in-person or online presentation at the discretion of the program chairs. These decisions will be final and presentation in the assigned format will be a condition of publication of your paper.  
 However, while the quality of submissions is the foremost criteria for selection, if you choose option (1) or (5), this may negatively impact acceptance of papers that are deemed worthy of acceptance but for which no presentation slot in the selected format (in-person or online) is available. For this reason, choose this option only if you anticipate not being able to travel to Sherbrooke or if you are unavailable for the duration of the online part.
