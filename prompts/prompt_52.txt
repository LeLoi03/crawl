  Submission  
 Submission is through the EasyChair conference system, by using the link below. The submission process requires registration to create an EasyChair account prior to submission.  
 Submission format  
 The authors should submit an extended abstract not exceeding 15 single-spaced pages on A4 (or US letter) paper excluding the title page (containing title, authors, affiliations, e-mail addresses, a short abstract, and keywords) and the references. Please note that 15 pages is an upper bound and shorter submissions are more than welcome. The authors are required to use the LaTeX style file supplied by Dagstuhl (LIPIcs). Papers must be submitted as a single file in PDF format.  
 Additional material intended for the referees but not for publication in the final version – for example details of proofs – may be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page limit. The program code of experimental papers should be made public, with reasonable documentation, such that the PC may evaluate replicability of experimental results.  
 Papers submitted for review should represent original, previously unpublished work and surveys of important results. At the time the extended abstract is submitted to CPM, and for the entire review period, the paper (or essentially the same paper) should not be under review by any other conference with published proceedings or by a scientific journal.  
 At least one author of an accepted paper is expected to present the paper at the conference as a registered participant. We are planning an in-person event, with online presentations in exceptional cases (e.g., authors with difficulties to travel). Should the pandemic situation change, we will move to hybrid or fully online.

 In addition, a "Fast Track" submission process coordinated with the SAT 2023 Conference ( satisfiability.org/SAT23  ) is planned. Papers not accepted to SAT 2023 can be revised and submitted to CP 2023 with the proviso that the research is also relevant to the CP conference. Papers for the SAT Fast Track have the following requirements:  
 Previously submitted to the SAT 2023 conference 
  The paper overall evaluation scores from SAT 2023 have: | An average positive score | ; and 
  At least one review score of two or higher. 
  Supplementary material must be submitted as a single ZIP file with: | PDF of the SAT 2023 submission; 
  PDF of the all the SAT 2023 reviews; and 
  Cover letter detailing the changes between the CP 2023 and SAT 2023 submissions. 
  The abstract and submission deadlines for the SAT Fast Track are: (please note that the fast track deadlines differ from the other CP track submission dates).  
 SAT fast track abstract registration: | May 1 | May 2, 2023 
  SAT fast track paper submission: May 17, 2023 (unchanged) 
  (Please note that the fast track deadlines differ from the regular CP submission dates.)  
 Submission Instructions  
 The submission Web page for CP2023 is easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cp2023  .  
 Papers should be submitted in the form of a PDF file following LIPIcs guidelines ( submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/5#author  ).  
 To open the conference more widely, two types of submissions are expected:  
 Full papers, that can use up to 15 pages (references excluded). 
  Short papers, that can use a maximum of 8 pages (references excluded). Short papers cover early results or results that can be adequately reported in 8 pages. They must nonetheless meet all the expected quality criteria of a CP paper within the 8-page limit. 
  Both full and short papers should attract a wide audience and will be allocated time for presentation during the conference.  
 In addition to the paper PDF, it is possible to submit optional supplementary material such as appendix, code, data, etc. Reviewers are not required to consider such supplementary material.  
 Submissions exceeding the page limits or improperly formatted will be rejected without review.  
 (For SAT fast track submissions, the abstract and paper submission deadlines are respectively, May 1  May 2 and May 17, 2023).  
 All papers will go through a double-blind reviewing process, meaning that authors and reviewers are anonymous to each other. For this reason, submitted papers should not contain author names, affiliations, or links to identifying websites. References to own papers should be cited in such a way so as not to reveal the authorship of the paper.  
 A given paper must be submitted to one track only. When necessary, the Program Chair may move a submission to another, more suitable track.  
 Submitted papers must not appear in, be accepted for, or be under review for another peer-reviewed conference (with archived conference proceedings) or journal. Submissions that have appeared at workshops or other meetings and have not been formally published or have appeared only in highly shortened form (e.g., abstracts) can be submitted as papers.  
 Proceedings  
 Accepted papers (in all tracks) will appear in conference proceedings published by LIPIcs. A preliminary proceedings will be available at the time of the conference with the final version afterwards (after the publication approval process with paper authors and LIPIcs).  
 Other Information  
 Questions about the paper submission process may be addressed to the Program Chair, Roland Yap ( cp2023@easychair.org  ).

  Abstract    
 Short-term underground mine planning problems are often difficult to solve due to the large number of activities and diverse machine types to be scheduled, as well as multiple operational constraints. This paper presents a Constraint Programming (CP) model to optimize short-term scheduling for the Meliadine underground gold mine in Nunavut, Canada, taking into consideration operational constraints and the daily development and production targets of the mine plan. To evaluate the efficacy of the developed CP short-term planning model, we compare schedules generated by the CP model with the ones created manually by the mine planner for two real data sets. Results demonstrate that the CP model outperforms the manual approach by generating more efficient schedules with lower makespans.

  Abstract    
 In this paper, we describe how we can effectively exploit alternative parameter configurations to a MaxSAT solver. We describe how these configurations can be computed in the context of MaxSAT. In particular, we experimentally show how to easily combine configurations of a non-competitive solver to obtain a better solving approach.

  Abstract    
 The cube-and-conquer paradigm enables massive parallelization of SAT solvers, which has proven to be crucial in solving highly combinatorial problems. In this paper, we apply the paradigm in the context of finite model finding, where we show that isomorphic cubes can be discarded since they lead to isomorphic models. However, we are faced with the complication that a well-known technique, the Least Number Heuristic (LNH), already exists in finite model finders to effectively prune (some) isomorphic models from the search. Therefore, it needs to be shown that isomorphic cubes still can be discarded when the LNH is used. The presented ideas are incorporated into the finite model finder Mace4, where we demonstrate significant improvements in model enumeration.

  Abstract    
 Clustering is a well-known task in Data Mining that aims at grouping data instances according to their similarity. It is an exploratory and unsupervised task whose results depend on many parameters, often requiring the expert to iterate several times before satisfaction. Constrained clustering has been introduced for better modeling the expectations of the expert. Nevertheless constrained clustering is not yet sufficient since it usually requires the constraints to be given before the clustering process. In this paper we address a more general problem that aims at modeling the exploratory clustering process, through a sequence of clustering modifications where expert constraints are added on the fly. We present an incremental constrained clustering framework integrating active query strategies and a Constraint Programming model to fit the expert expectations while preserving the stability of the partition, so that the expert can understand the process and apprehend its impact. Our model supports instance and group-level constraints, which can be relaxed. Experiments on reference datasets and a case study related to the analysis of satellite image time series show the relevance of our framework.

  Abstract    
 Explaining constraint programs is useful for debugging an unsatisfiable program, to understand why a given solution is optimal, or to understand how to find a unique solution. A recently proposed framework for explaining constraint programs works well to explain the unique solution to a problem step by step. It can also be used to step-wise explain why a model is unsatisfiable, but this may create redundant steps and introduce superfluous information into the explanation sequence. This paper proposes methods to simplify a (step-wise) explanation sequence, to generate simple steps that together form a short, interpretable sequence. We propose an algorithm to greedily construct an initial sequence and two filtering algorithms that eliminate redundant steps and unnecessarily complex parts of explanation sequences. Experiments on diverse benchmark instances show that our techniques can significantly simplify step-wise explanation sequences.

  Abstract    
 Pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints are highly expressive, and many combinatorial optimization problems can be modeled using pseudo-Boolean optimization (PBO). It is recognized that stochastic local search (SLS) is a powerful paradigm for solving combinatorial optimization problems, but the development of SLS for solving PBO is still in its infancy. In this paper, we develop an effective SLS algorithm for solving PBO, dubbed NuPBO, which introduces a novel scoring function for PB constraints and a new weighting scheme. We conduct experiments on a broad range of six public benchmarks, including three real-world benchmarks, a benchmark from PB competition, an integer linear programming optimization benchmark, and a crafted combinatorial benchmark, to compare NuPBO against five state-of-the-art competitors, including a recently-proposed SLS PBO solver LS-PBO, two complete PB solvers PBO-IHS and RoundingSat, and two mixed integer programming (MIP) solvers Gurobi and SCIP. NuPBO has been exhibited to perform best on these three real-world benchmarks. On the other three benchmarks, NuPBO shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art competitors, and it significantly outperforms LS-PBO, indicating that NuPBO greatly advances the state of the art in SLS for solving PBO.

  Abstract    
 Discrete optimization problems expressible as dynamic programs can be solved by branch-and-bound with decision diagrams. This approach dynamically compiles bounded-width decision diagrams to derive both lower and upper bounds on unexplored parts of the search space, until they are all enumerated or discarded. Assuming a minimization problem, relaxed decision diagrams provide lower bounds through state merging while restricted decision diagrams obtain upper bounds by excluding states to limit their size. As the selection of states to merge or delete is done locally, it is very myopic to the global problem structure. In this paper, we propose a novel way to proceed that is based on pre-solving a so-called aggregate version of the problem with a limited number of states. The compiled decision diagram of this aggregate problem is tractable and can fit in memory. It can then be exploited by the original branch-and-bound to generate additional pruning and guide the compilation of restricted decision diagrams toward good solutions. The results of the numerical study we conducted on three combinatorial optimization problems show a clear improvement in the performance of DD-based solvers when blended with the proposed techniques. These results also suggest an approach where the aggregate dynamic programming model could be used in replacement of the relaxed decision diagrams altogether.

  Abstract    
 It is known that the multiplication of an N × M matrix with an M × P matrix can be performed using fewer multiplications than what the naive NMP approach suggests. The most famous instance of this is Strassen’s algorithm for multiplying 2× 2 matrices in 7 instead of 8 multiplications. This gives rise to the constraint satisfaction problem of fast matrix multiplication, where a set of R < NMP multiplication terms must be chosen and combined such that they satisfy correctness constraints on the output matrix. Despite its highly combinatorial nature, this problem has not been exhaustively examined from that perspective, as evidenced for example by the recent deep reinforcement learning approach of AlphaTensor. In this work, we propose a simple yet novel Constraint Programming approach to find algorithms for fast matrix multiplication or provide proof of infeasibility otherwise. We propose a set of symmetry-breaking constraints and valid inequalities that are particularly helpful in proving infeasibility. On the feasible side, we find that exploiting solver performance variability in conjunction with a sparsity-based problem decomposition enables finding solutions for larger (feasible) instances of fast matrix multiplication. Our experimental results using CP Optimizer demonstrate that we can find fast matrix multiplication algorithms for matrices up to 3× 3 with R = 23 in a short amount of time.

 A CP Approach for the Liner Shipping Network Design Problem   
 Authors:  Yousra El Ghazi, Djamal Habet, and Cyril Terrioux  
  Abstract    
 The liner shipping network design problem consists, for a shipowner, in determining, on the one hand, which maritime lines (in the form of rotations serving a set of ports) to open, and, on the other hand, the assignment of ships (container ships) with the adapted sizes for the different lines to carry all the container flows. In this paper, we propose a modeling of this problem using constraint programming. Then, we present a preliminary study of its solving using a state-of-the-art solver, namely the OR-Tools CP-SAT solver.

  Abstract    
 Constraint Programming has been widely, and very successfully, applied to scheduling problems. However, the focus has been on uninterruptible tasks, and preemptive scheduling problems are typically harder for existing constraint solvers. Indeed, one usually needs to represent all potential task interruptions thus introducing many variables and symmetrical or dominated choices. In this paper, building on mostly known results, we observe that a large class of preemptive disjunctive scheduling problems do not require an explicit model of task interruptions. We then introduce a new constraint programming approach for this class of problems that significantly outperforms state-of-the-art dedicated approaches in our experimental results.

  Abstract    
 In this paper, we propose an enhancement of the filtering power of the edge finding rule, based on the Profile and the TimeTable data structures. The minimal slack and the maximum density criteria are used to select potential task intervals for the edge finding rule. The strong detection rule of the horizontally elastic edge finder of Fetgo and Tayou is then applied on those intervals, which results in a new filtering rule, named Slack-Density Horizontally Elastic Edge Finder. The new rule subsumes the edge finding rule and it is not comparable to the Gingras and Quimper horizontally elastic edge finder rule and the TimeTable edge finder rule. A two-phase filtering algorithm of complexity 𝒪(n²) (where n is the number of tasks sharing the resource) is proposed for the new rule. Improvements based on the TimeTable are obtained by considering fix part of external tasks which overlap with the potential task intervals. The detection and the adjustment of the improve algorithm are further increased, while the algorithm remains quadratic. Experimental results, on a well-known suite of benchmark instances of Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems, show that the propounded algorithms are competitive with the state-of-the-art algorithms, in terms of running time and tree search reduction.

  Abstract    
 Energy companies are considering producing renewable fuels such as hydrogen/ammonia. Setting up a production network means deciding where to build production plants, and how to operate them at minimum electricity and transport costs. These decisions are complicated by many factors including the difficulty in obtaining accurate current data (e.g., electricity price and transport costs) for potential supply locations, the accuracy of data predictions (e.g., for demand and costs), and the need for some decisions to be made due to external (not modelled) factors. Thus, decision-makers need access to a user-centric decision system that helps them visualise, explore, interact and compare the many possible solutions of many different scenarios. This paper describes the system we have built to support our energy partner in making such decisions, and shows the advantages of having a graphical user-focused interactive tool, and of using a high-level constraint modelling language (MiniZinc) to implement the underlying model.

  Abstract    
 Multi-objective problems are frequent in the real world. In general they involve several incomparable objectives and the goal is to find a set of Pareto optimal solutions, i.e. solutions that are incomparable two by two. In order to better deal with these problems in CP the global constraint Pareto was developed by Schaus and Hartert to handle the relations between the objective variables and the current set of Pareto optimal solutions, called the archive. This constraint handles three operations: adding a new solution to the archive, removing solutions from the archive that are dominated by a new solution, and reducing the bounds of the objective variables. The complexity of these operations depends on the size of the archive. In this paper, we propose to use a multi-valued Decision Diagram (MDD) to represent the archive of Pareto optimal solutions. MDDs are a compressed representation of solution sets, which allows us to obtain a compressed and therefore smaller archive. We introduce several algorithms to implement the above operations on compressed archives with a complexity depending on the size of the archive.

  Abstract    
 In the (maxmin) p-dispersion problem we seek to locate a set of facilities in an area so that the minimum distance between any pair of facilities is maximized. We study a variant of this problem where there exist constraints specifying the minimum allowed distances between the facilities. This type of problem, which we call PDDP, has not received much attention within the literature on location and dispersion problems, despite its relevance to real scenarios. We propose both ILP and CP methods to solve the PDDP. Regarding ILP, we give two formulations derived from a classic and a state-of-the-art model for p-dispersion, respectively. Regarding CP, we first give a generic model that can be implemented within any standard CP solver, and we then propose a specialized heuristic Branch&Bound method. Experiments demonstrate that the ILP formulations are more efficient than the CP model, as the latter is unable to prove optimality in reasonable time, except for small problems, and is usually slower in finding solutions of the same quality than the ILP models. However, although the ILP approach displays good performance on small to medium size problems, it cannot efficiently handle larger ones. The heuristic CP-based method can be very efficient on larger problems and is able to quickly discover solutions to problems that are very hard for an ILP solver.

  Abstract    
 Multi skill resource-constrained project scheduling Problems (MS-RCPSP) have been object of studies from many years. Also, preemption is an important feature of real-life scheduling models. However, very little research has been investigated concerning MS-RCPSPs including preemption, and even less research moving out from academic benchmarks to real problem solving. In this paper we present a solution to those problems based on a hybrid method derived from large neighborhood search incorporating constraint programming components tailored to deal with complex scheduling constraints. We also present a constraint programming model adapted to preemption. The methods are implemented in a new open source python library allowing to easily reuse existing modeling languages and solvers. We evaluate the methods on an industrial case study from aircraft manufacturing including additional complicating constraints such as generalized precedence relations, resource calendars and partial preemption on which the standard CP Optimizer solver, even with the preemption-specific model, is unable to provide solutions in reasonable times. The large neighborhood search method is also able to find new best solutions on standard multi-skill project scheduling instances, performing better than a reference method from the literature.

  Abstract    
 Decision trees are a popular classification model in machine learning due to their interpretability and performance. However, the number of splits in decision trees grow exponentially with their depth which can incur a higher computational cost, increase data fragmentation, hinder interpretability, and restrict their applicability to memory-constrained hardware. In constrast, binary decision diagrams (BDD) utilize the same split across each level, leading to a linear number of splits in total. Recent work has considered optimal binary decision diagrams (BDD) as compact and accurate classification models, but has only focused on binary datasets and has not explicitly optimized the compactness of the resulting diagrams. In this work, we present a SAT-based encoding for a multi-terminal variant of BDDs (MTBDDs) that incorporates a state-of-the-art direct encoding of numerical features. We then develop and evaluate different approaches to explicitly optimize the compactness of the diagrams. In one family of approaches, we learn a tree BDD first and model the size of the diagram the tree will be reduced to as a secondary objective, in a one-stage or two-stage optimization scheme. Alternatively, we directly learn diagrams that support multi-dimensional splits for improved expressiveness. Our experiments show that direct encoding of numerical features leads to better performance. Furthermore, we show that exact optimization of size leads to more compact solutions while maintaining higher accuracy. Finally, our experiments show that multi-dimensional splits are a viable approach to achieving higher expressiveness with a lower computational cost.

  Abstract    
 Optimisation models are concise mathematical representations of real-world problems, usually developed by modelling experts in consultation with domain experts. Typically, domain experts are only indirectly involved in the problem modelling process, providing information and feedback, and thus perceive the deployed model as a black box. Unfortunately, real-world problems "drift" over time, where changes in the input data parameters and/or requirements cause the developed model to fail. This requires modelling experts to revisit and update deployed models. This paper identifies the issue of problem drift in optimisation problems using as case study a model we developed for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to help them allocate funds to different crises. We describe the initial model and the challenges due to problem drift that occurred over the following years. We then use this case study to explore techniques for mitigating problem drift by including domain experts in the modelling process via techniques such as domain specific languages.

  Abstract    
 The rapid rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) has invoked the need for explainable AI (XAI). One of the most prominent approaches to XAI is to train rule-based ML models, e.g. decision trees, lists and sets, that are deemed interpretable due to their transparent nature. Recent years have witnessed a large body of work in the area of constraints- and reasoning-based approaches to the inference of interpretable models, in particular decision sets (DSes). Despite being shown to outperform heuristic approaches in terms of accuracy, most of them suffer from scalability issues and often fail to handle large training data, in which case no solution is offered. Motivated by this limitation and the success of gradient boosted trees, we propose a novel anytime approach to producing DSes that are both accurate and interpretable. The approach makes use of the concept of a generalized formal explanation and builds on the recent advances in formal explainability of gradient boosted trees. Experimental results obtained on a wide range of datasets, demonstrate that our approach produces DSes that more accurate than those of the state-of-the-art algorithms and comparable with them in terms of explanation size.

  Abstract    
 A graph is induced k-universal if it contains all graphs of order k as an induced subgraph. For over half a century, the question of determining smallest k-universal graphs has been studied. A related question asks for a smallest k-universal tournament containing all tournaments of order k. This paper proposes and compares SAT-based methods for answering these questions exactly for small values of k. Our methods scale to values for which a generate-and-test approach isn't feasible; for instance, we show that an induced 7-universal graph has more than 16 vertices, whereas the number of all connected graphs on 16 vertices, modulo isomorphism, is a number with 23 decimal digits Our methods include static and dynamic symmetry breaking and lazy encodings, employing external subgraph isomorphism testing.

  Abstract    
 Recognizing the satisfiability of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) is NP-hard. Although several Machine Learning (ML) approaches have attempted this task by casting it as a binary classification problem, they have had only limited success for a variety of challenging reasons. First, the NP-hardness of the task does not make it amenable to straightforward approaches. Second, CSPs come in various forms and sizes while many ML algorithms impose the same form and size on their training and test instances. Third, the representation of a CSP instance is not unique since the variables and their domain values are unordered. In this paper, we propose FastMapSVM, a recently developed ML framework that leverages a distance function between pairs of objects. We define a novel distance function between two CSP instances using maxflow computations. This distance function is well defined for CSPs of different sizes. It is also invariant to the ordering on the variables and their domain values. Therefore, our framework has broader applicability compared to other approaches. We discuss various representational and combinatorial advantages of FastMapSVM. Through experiments, we also show that it outperforms other state-of-the-art ML approaches.

  Abstract    
 Pseudo-Boolean optimization (PBO) is usually used to model combinatorial optimization problems, especially for some real-world applications. Despite its significant importance in both theory and applications, there are few works on using local search to solve PBO. This paper develops a novel local search framework for PBO, which has three main ideas. First, we design a two-level selection strategy to evaluate all candidate variables. Second, we propose a novel deep optimization strategy to disturb some search spaces. Third, a sampling flipping method is applied to help the algorithm jump out of local optimum. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms outperform three state-of-the-art PBO algorithms on most instances.

 Predict-Then-Optimise Strategies for Water Flow Control (Short Paper)   
 Authors:  Vincent Barbosa Vaz, James Bailey, Christopher Leckie, and Peter J. Stuckey  
  Abstract    
 A pressure sewer system is a network of pump stations used to collect and manage sewage from individual properties that cannot be directly connected to the gravity driven sewer network due to the topography of the terrain. We consider a common scenario for a pressure sewer system, where individual sites collect sewage in a local tank, and then pump it into the gravity fed sewage network. Standard control systems simply wait until the local tank reaches (near) capacity and begin pumping out. Unfortunately such simple control usually leads to peaks in sewage flow in the morning and evening, corresponding to peak water usage in the properties. High peak flows require equalization basins or overflow systems, or larger capacity sewage treatment plants. In this paper we investigate combining prediction and optimisation to better manage peak sewage flows. We use simple prediction methods to generate realistic possible future scenarios, and then develop optimisation models to generate pumping plans that try to smooth out flows into the network. The solutions of these models create a policy for pumping out that is specialized to individual properties and which overall is able to substantially reduce peak flows.

 Constraint Programming Models for Depth-Optimal Qubit Assignment and SWAP-Based Routing (Short Paper)   
 Authors:  Kyle E. C. Booth  
  Abstract    
 Due to the limited connectivity of gate model quantum devices, logical quantum circuits must be compiled to target hardware before they can be executed. Often, this process involves the insertion of SWAP gates into the logical circuit, usually increasing the depth of the circuit, achieved by solving a so-called qubit assignment and routing problem. Recently, a number of integer linear programming (ILP) models have been proposed for solving the qubit assignment and routing problem to proven optimality. These models encode the objective function and constraints of the problem, and leverage the use of automated solver technology to find hardware-compliant quantum circuits. In this work, we propose constraint programming (CP) models for this problem and compare their performance against ILP for circuit depth minimization for both linear and two-dimensional grid lattice device topologies on a set of randomly generated instances. Our empirical analysis indicates that the proposed CP approaches outperform the ILP models both in terms of solution quality and runtime.

 Partitioning a Map into Homogeneous Contiguous Regions: A Branch-And-Bound Approach Using Decision Diagrams (Short Paper)   
 Authors:  Nicolas Golenvaux, Xavier Gillard, Siegfried Nijssen, and Pierre Schaus  
  Abstract    
 Regionalization is a crucial spatial analysis technique used for partitioning a map divided into zones into k continuous areas, optimizing the similarity of zone attributes within each area. This technique has a variety of applications in fields like urban planning, environmental management, and geographic information systems. The REDCAP algorithm is a well-known approach for addressing the regionalization problem. It consists of two main steps: first, it generates a spatially contiguous tree (SCT) representing the neighborhood structure of the set of spatial objects using a contiguity-constrained hierarchical clustering method. Second, it greedily removes k-1 edges from the SCT to create k regions. While this approach has proven to be effective, it may not always produce the most optimal solutions. We propose an alternative method for the second step, an exact dynamic programming (DP) formulation for the k-1 edges removal problem. This DP is solved using a multi-valued decision diagram (MDD)-based branch and bound solver leading to a more optimal solution. We compared our proposed method with the REDCAP state-of-the-art technique on real data and synthetic ones, using different instances of the regionalization problem and different supervised and unsupervised metrics. Our results indicate that our approach provides higher quality partitions than those produced by REDCAP at acceptable computational costs. This suggests that our method could be a viable alternative for addressing the regionalization problem in various applications.
