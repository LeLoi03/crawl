   Conference Call for Papers  
 SIGCOMM takes a broad view of networking, and welcomes submissions on these topics, among others:  
  All types of computer networks, including mobile, wide-area, data center, embedded, home, and enterprise networks.  
  All parts of the network life cycle, including planning, designing, building, operating, troubleshooting, and migrations.  
  All approaches and techniques, including theory, analysis, experiments, and machine learning.  
  SIGCOMM 2023 will accept submissions in three tracks:   
 Overview  
 Top Research Topics at ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication?  
  The Internet (16.11%) 
  The conference is mainly concerned with subjects like Computer network, Distributed computing, The Internet, Network packet and Computer security. The Computer network study featured in the conference draws parallels with the field of Throughput. In addition to Distributed computing research, ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication aims to explore topics under Network architecture, Network topology, Scalability and Routing table.  
 Research on The Internet presented in the event concerns the broader topic of World Wide Web. The event features Network packet research that overlaps with concepts in Real-time computing. The work on Static routing tackled in it brings together disciplines like Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector routing and Dynamic Source Routing.  
 The event emphasizes research on Link-state routing protocol, which includes concerns such as Path vector protocol. More specifically, the research on Software-defined networking in the event is related to OpenFlow. Presentations on Routing protocol include those discussing Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol, Routing domain, Hierarchical routing, Zone Routing Protocol and Wireless Routing Protocol.  
 What are the most cited papers published at the conference?  
  Research areas of the most cited articles at ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication:  
 The published papers mainly tackle studies in Computer network, Distributed computing, Network packet, The Internet and Throughput. Computer network research in the conference papers connects with the study of Scalability. The study of Distributed computing in the most cited papers encompasses disciplines such as Routing table, as well as fields such as Hazy Sighted Link State Routing Protocol, all of which overlap with one another.  
 What topics the last edition of the conference is best known for?  
 Computer network 
  The previous edition focused in particular on these issues:  
 The conference was organized to reinforce research efforts on Computer network, Network packet, Distributed computing, The Internet and Key (cryptography). ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication focuses on Computer network as well as the interrelated topic of Throughput. The conference focused on Network packet research but expanded to cover Central processing unit.  
 Topics in Distributed computing were tackled in line with various other fields like Artificial neural network, Quality of service, Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution and Topology (electrical circuits). The conference explores topics in The Internet which can be helpful for research in disciplines like Computer security, Software deployment, Architecture and Internet privacy. Forwarding plane research in it involves the investigation of Scalability studies, all of which are linked to disciplines such as Artificial intelligence.  
 The most cited articles from the last conference are:  
 Efficient sparse collective communication and its application to accelerate distributed deep learning (5 citations) 
  The ties that un-bind: decoupling IP from web services and sockets for robust addressing agility at CDN-scale (2 citations) 
  Papers citation over time  
 A key indicator for each conference is its effectiveness in reaching other researchers with the papers published at that venue.

 Publication chance based on affiliation  
 The publication chance index shows the ratio of articles published by the best research institutions at the conference edition to all articles published within that conference. The best research institutions were selected based on the largest number of articles published during all editions of the conference.  
 Returning Authors Index  
 A very common phenomenon observed among researchers publishing scientific articles is the intentional selection of conferences they have already attended in the past. In particular, it is worth analyzing the case when the authors participate in the same conference from year to year.  
 The Returning Authors Index presented below illustrates the ratio of authors who participated in both a given as well as the previous edition of the conference in relation to all participants in a given year.

 Returning Institution Index

 The experience to innovation index  
 Our experience to innovation index was created to show a cross-section of the experience level of authors publishing at a conference. The index includes the authors publishing at the last edition of a conference  , grouped by total number of publications throughout their academic career (P) and the total number of citations of these publications ever received (C).  
 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups:  
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25),

 Authors of accepted submissions will be required to present their work in-person at the conference  , except for a limited number of papers and tutorials that are scheduled to be virtual.  
 Submission Information   
 SIGCSE-Style Workshops are now called Tutorials  : We are now referring to these three-hour interactive sessions as “Tutorials”. The submission and review process will otherwise be the same as they were last year. (Explanation: We’ve heard some confusion between SIGCSE-Style Workshops and “Workshops” that are intended to be a collection of papers.)  
 New/clarified AI Policies  : Please visit the Policies on Generative AI, LLMs, and Related Tools  menu item under the Info menu for more details.  
 Earlier Deadlines  : Unfortunately, with SIGCSE TS occurring about three weeks earlier this year than last year, as well as the ever-increasing number of submissions, we have had to move the paper deadlines to mid/late July.
