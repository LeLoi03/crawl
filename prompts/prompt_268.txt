  Emerging Trends in Resilient Control of Networked Systems     
 Abstract:    
  Controller design faces the challenge of ensuring desired performance and safe operation while managing uncertainties, which can arise from unknown system dynamics, external disturbances, or interactions with unknown entities. Machine learning techniques, like Gaussian processes, can estimate these uncertainties and provide valuable insights.  
  Gaussian processes have gained popularity in the past two decades due to their bias-variance trade-off and connection to Bayesian mathematics. Unlike many methods, Gaussian processes offer a regression function and an uncertainty measure for predictions. This unique feature makes them ideal for various control applications, such as model predictive control, robust control, reinforcement learning, and optimization tasks. The uncertainty measure enables convergence, performance, and safety guarantees. However, incorporating Gaussian processes into closed-loop control systems presents challenges like closed-loop uncertainty propagation and real-time feasible online learning.  
 This tutorial-style workshop aims to introduce the fundamentals of Gaussian processes for modeling and control, highlighting open challenges and opportunities. Experienced experts from academia and industry will cover the basics of Gaussian processes, showcasing their potential for the control community and recent advancements in learning-based control under uncertainties. The workshop targets graduate-level students and experienced theoretical and practical control engineers interested in enhancing their controller design knowledge using Gaussian processes and machine learning.

 Abstract:    
  The framework of cyber-physical systems (CPS) that captures the tight interaction of computational systems with the physical world is believed to carry great promises for analysis and design of systems in many safety-critical industrial applications. Examples of such applications include aerospace, automotive, transportation systems, robotics, chemical process, energy, and healthcare. Within CPS, embedded control software plays a significant role by monitoring and adjusting several physical variables through feedback loops where physical processes affect computation and vice versa. Although CPS have become ubiquitous in modern technology due to significant advances in computational devices, closed-form mathematical models for those complex systems are either not available or equally complex to be constructed. Consequently, one cannot employ model-based techniques to analyze and design this type of complex unknown systems. Hence, data-driven techniques are essential to provide formal analysis for CPS with unknown dynamics.  
  Over the past decade, two types of direct and indirect data-driven techniques have been proposed in the relevant literature for the formal analysis and design of unknown CPS. More specifically, indirect data-driven techniques are those which leverage system identification to learn approximate models of unknown systems, followed by model-based controller analysis approaches. Their advantage is that once the identification phase is achieved, one may rely on the powerful armada of techniques available in model-based control. On the downside, most identification techniques are mainly limited to linear or some specific class of nonlinear systems, and accordingly, acquiring an accurate model for complex systems via those indirect techniques could be expensive. In comparison, direct data-driven techniques are those that bypass the system identification phase and directly employ system measurements for the verification and controller design of unknown CPS.  
  In this workshop, we bring together a number of researchers active in the area of data-driven verification and control of CPS. The contributions will describe recently developed efforts towards new frontiers on the subject. Along with cherishing the exchange of ideas between researchers in the field, we aim to achieve the following goals for the audience attending the workshop:  
 Tutorials   
 Saturday, 8th July   
  Estimation of Noise Parameters in State Space Models     
  Knowledge of a system model is crucial for many state estimation, signal processing, fault detection, and optimal control problems. The model is often designed to be consistent with the random behavior of the system quantities and properties of the measurements. While the deterministic part of the model often arises from mathematical modeling based on physical, chemical, or biological laws governing the system's behavior, the stochastic part's statistics are often challenging to find by the modeling and must be identified using the measured data. Incorrect description of the noise statistics may significantly worsen estimation, signal processing, detection, control quality, or even failure of the underlying algorithms. The tutorial introduces a more than six decades-long history, recent advances, and state-of-the-art methods for estimating the properties of the noises, including implementation issues. In particular, the estimation of state-space model noise means, covariance matrices, and other parameters are treated.

  Mechatronics and robotics for manipulation: design and control     
  Mourad BENOUSSAAD will give the fifth lecture. Physical Human-robot Interaction is a promising and challenging robotics field but requires to be improved to achieve more complex tasks. One of these complex tasks can be a co-manipulation between human and robot of heavy, bulky or flexible object. To consider a certain number of issues related to the interaction stability, safety and human ergonomics and comfort, the human should be considered more deeply as system than just an external perturbation force. This lecture will introduce to physical human-robotics manipulation where the human-object-robot interaction is considered as a whole system, which can be entirely modeled, measured and partially or completely controlled.  
  Gerardo FLORES will introduce to aerial manipulation, i.e. manipulation of objects by using aerial vehicles equipped with manipulators. Such approach to manipulation has several advantages like modularity of the manipulators, large positioning of the object, unlimited size of the object.  
  The final lecture will be given by Sofiane KHADRAOUI. His talk will introduce the modeling of manipulators and the controllers design by considering the challenges raised when manipulating objects: nonlinearities, models uncertainties, objects deformation, sides effects of the environment.

10. SSS_0 conference:
​     
 SSS is an international forum for researchers and practitioners in the design and development of distributed systems with a focus on systems that are able to provide guarantees on their structure, performance, and/or security in the face of an adverse operational environment. The symposium encourages submissions of original contributions on fundamental research and practical applications concerning topics in the five symposium tracks:   
 Track A. Self-stabilizing Systems: Theory and Practice   
  Interoperability across systems 
 SSS Tracks     
 New Conference Model    
 This year, we experiment a new conference model. There will be TWO deadlines. The review process for these two deadlines will not overlap to allow papers rejected during the first review phase to be reworked, corrected, and enhanced before being resubmitted on the second review round, if wished by the authors. Papers may be submitted at only one deadline. Of course, accepted papers of the first review round are definitely accepted and should not be submitted to the second round. In case of resubmission, reviews from the first phase will be transmitted to the reviewers of the second phase.   
 Double-blind Review    
 All submissions must be anonymous. We use a somewhat relaxed implementation of double-blind peer review: you are free to disseminate your work through arXiv and other online repositories and give presentations on your work as usual. However, please make sure you do not mention your own name or affiliation in the submission, and please do not include obvious references in the text that reveal your identity. A reviewer who has not previously seen the paper should be able to read it without accidentally learning the identity of the authors. Please feel free to ask the PC chairs if you have any questions about the double-blind policy of SSS 2022.   
 Important Dates    
 First Acceptance Notification: May 11, 2023    
 Camera-Ready Copy Due: May 21, 2023    
 Second Acceptance Notification: July 23, 2023    
 Camera-Ready Copy Due: August 1, 2023    
 Paper Submission    
 Papers are to be submitted electronically through EasyChair        
 All submission must conform to the formatting instructions of Springer LNCS series (see the guidelines here    ).   
 Each submission must be an original work written in English, in PDF format.   
 All corresponding authors must fill out and submit the License to Publish Form found here   .    
 Authors are encouraged to include their ORCIDs  in the proceedings.   
 Submissions    
 There are two types of submissions: regular papers and brief announcements.   
 A regular submission must not exceed 15 pages (including the title, abstract, figures, and references). 
  A brief announcement submission must not exceed 5 pages and should not include any appendix. 
 Additional necessary details for an expert to verify the main claims of the submission may be included in a clearly marked appendix if extra space is needed.   
 Any submission deviating from these guidelines will be rejected without consideration of its merits. It is recommended that a regular submission begins with a succinct statement of the problem being addressed, a summary of the main results or conclusions, a brief explanation of their significance, a brief statement of the key ideas, and a comparison with related work, all tailored to a non-specialist. Technical development of the work, directed to the specialist, should follow. Papers outside of the conference scope will be rejected without review. For the second round only, if requested by the authors on the cover page, a regular submission that is not selected for a regular presentation will also be considered for the brief announcement format. This will not affect consideration of the paper for a regular presentation.   
 Publication    
 Regular papers and brief announcements will be included in the conference proceedings. Conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS conference series. Previous publications can be viewed here    .   
 ​   
 ​     
 ​   
 Paper Award    
 Prizes will be given to the best regular paper and best student regular paper. A regular paper is eligible for the best student paper if at least one of its authors is a full-time student at submission time. Authors should clearly indicate whether their submission is eligible to be considered for the best student paper award (e.g., using a \thanks in the title). The PC may decline to confer awards or may split awards.
