 On Fully-Secure Honest Majority MPC Without Round Overhead  
  Abstract   
 Fully secure multiparty computation (or guaranteed output delivery) among n  parties can be achieved with perfect security if the number of corruptions t  is less than n  /3, or with statistical security with the help of a broadcast channel if \(t<n/2\)  . In the case of \(t<n/3\)  , it is known that it is possible to achieve linear communication complexity, but at a cost of having a round count of \(\varOmega (\textsf{depth}(C) + n)\)  in the worst case. The number of rounds can be reduced to \(O(\textsf{depth}(C))\)  by either increasing communication, or assuming some correlated randomness (a setting also known as the preprocesing model). For \(t<n/2\)  it is also known that linear communication complexity is achievable, but at the cost of \(\varOmega (\textsf{depth}(C) + n^2)\)  rounds, due to the use of a technique called dispute control. However, in contrast to the \(t<n/3\)  setting, it is not known how to reduce this round count for \(t<n/2\)  to \(O(\textsf{depth}(C))\)  , neither allowing for larger communication, or by using correlated randomness.   
 In this work we make progress in this direction by taking the second route above: we present a fully secure protocol for \(t<n/2\)  in the preprocessing model, that achieves linear communication complexity, and whose round complexity is only \(O(\textsf{depth}(C))\)  , without the additive \(n^2\)  term that appears from the use of dispute control. While on the \(t<n/3\)  such result requires circuits of width \(\varOmega (n)\)  , in our case circuits must be of width \(\varOmega (n^2)\)  , leaving it as an interesting future problem to reduce this gap. Our \(O(\textsf{depth}(C))\)  round count is achieved by avoiding the use of dispute control entirely, relying on a different tool for guaranteeing output. In the \(t<n/3\)  setting when correlated randomness is available, this is done by using error correction to reconstruct secret-shared values, but in the \(t<n/2\)  case the equivalent is robust secret-sharing, which guarantees the reconstruction of a secret in spite of errors. However, we note that a direct use of such tool would lead to quadratic  communication, stemming from the fact that each party needs to authenticate their share towards each other party. At the crux of our techniques lies a novel method for reconstructing a batch of robustly secret-shared values while involving only a linear amount of communication per secret, which may also be of independent interest.

 Broadcast-Optimal Two Round MPC with Asynchronous Peer-to-Peer Channels  
  Abstract   
 In this paper we continue the study of two-round broadcast-optimal MPC, where broadcast is used in one of the two rounds, but not in both. We consider the realistic scenario where the round that does not use broadcast is asynchronous  . Since a first asynchronous round (even when followed by a round of broadcast) does not admit any secure computation, we introduce a new notion of asynchrony which we call \((t_{d}, t_{m})\)  -asynchrony. In this new notion of asynchrony, an adversary can delay or drop up to \(t_{d}\)  of a given party’s incoming messages; we refer to \(t_{d}\)  as the deafness threshold  . Similarly, the adversary can delay or drop up to \(t_{m}\)  of a given party’s outgoing messages; we refer to \(t_{m}\)  as the muteness threshold  .   
 We determine which notions of secure two-round computation are achievable when the first round is \((t_{d}, t_{m})\)  -asynchronous, and the second round is over broadcast. Similarly, we determine which notions of secure two-round computation are achievable when the first round is over broadcast, and the second round is (fully) asynchronous. We consider the cases where a PKI is available, when only a CRS is available but private communication in the first round is possible, and the case when only a CRS is available and no private communication is possible before the parties have had a chance to exchange public keys.   
 Effective Pairings in Isogeny-Based Cryptography  
  Abstract   
 Pairings are useful tools in isogeny-based cryptography and have been used in SIDH/SIKE and other protocols. As a general technique, pairings can be used to move problems about points on curves to elements in finite fields. However, until now, their applicability was limited to curves over fields with primes of a specific shape and pairings seemed too costly for the type of primes that are nowadays often used in isogeny-based cryptography. We remove this roadblock by optimizing pairings for highly-composite degrees such as those encountered in CSIDH and SQISign. This makes the general technique viable again: We apply our low-cost pairing to problems of general interest, such as supersingularity verification and finding full-torsion points, and show that we can outperform current methods, in some cases up to four times faster than the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we analyze how pairings can be used to improve deterministic and dummy-free CSIDH. Finally, we provide a constant-time implementation (in Rust) that shows the practicality of these algorithms.   
 Krijn Reijnders   
 Oblivious Pseudo-Random Functions (OPRFs) are a central tool for building modern protocols for authentication and distributed computation. For example, OPRFs enable simple login protocols that do not reveal the password to the provider, which helps to mitigate known shortcomings of password-based authentication such as password reuse or mix-up. Reliable treatment of passwords becomes more and more important as we login to a multitude of services with different passwords in our daily life.   
 To ensure the security and privacy of such services in the long term, modern protocols should always consider the possibility of attackers with quantum computers. Therefore, recent research has focused on constructing post-quantum-secure OPRFs. Unfortunately, existing constructions either lack efficiency, or they are based on complex and relatively new cryptographic assumptions, some of which have lately been disproved.   
 In this paper, we revisit the security and the efficiency of the well-known “OPRFs via Garbled Circuits” approach. Such an OPRF is presumably post-quantum-secure and built from well-understood primitives, namely symmetric cryptography and oblivious transfer. We investigate security in the strong Universal Composability model, which guarantees security even when multiple instances are executed in parallel and in conjunction with arbitrary other protocols, which is a realistic scenario in today’s internet. At the same time, it is faster than other current post-quantum-secure OPRFs. Our implementation and benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed OPRF is currently among the best choices if the privacy of the data has to be guaranteed for a long time.

 Physical Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Five Cells  
  Abstract   
 Five Cells is a logic puzzle consisting of a rectangular grid, with some cells containing a number. The player has to partition the grid into pentominoes such that the number in each cell must be equal to the number of edges of that cell that are borders of pentominoes. In this paper, we propose two physical zero-knowledge proof protocols for Five Cells using a deck of playing cards, which allow a prover to physically show that he/she knows a solution of the puzzle without revealing it. In the optimization of our first protocol, we also develop a technique to reduce the number of required cards from quadratic to linear in the number of cells, which can be used in other zero-knowledge proof protocols related to graph coloring as well.

   Passive and Active Measurement Conference 2023  
 The Passive and Active Measurement (PAM) conference brings together researchers and operators to discuss novel and emerging work in the area of network measurement and analysis. PAM is inclusive of all areas of network measurement, but focuses on systems-based research and real-world data. Indeed, measurement technology is needed at all layers of the network stack, ranging from power profiling of hardware components to virtualization in data centers to application profiling and even user experience. Work with operational impact or relevance to the broader network research community is especially welcome, as is early and promising measurement technique.

  Stranger VPNs: Investigating the Geo-Unblocking Capabilities of Commercial VPN Providers    Etienne Khan (University of Twente)  , Anna Sperotto (University of Twente)  , Jeroen van der Ham (University of Twente & NCSC-NL)  , Roland van Rijswijk-Deij (University of Twente)    Abstract  Paper  Video | Abstract:  Commercial Virtual Private Network (VPN) providers have steadily increased their presence in Internet culture. Their most advertised use cases are preserving the user's privacy, or circumventing censorship. However, a number of VPN providers nowadays have added what they call a streaming unblocking service. In practice, such VPN providers allow their users to access streaming content that Video-on-Demand (VOD) providers do not provide in a specific geographical region. In this work, we investigate the mechanisms by which commercial VPN providers facilitate access to geo-restricted content, de-facto bypassing VPN-detection countermeasures by VOD providers (blocklists). We actively measure the geo-unblocking capabilities of 6 commercial VPN providers in 4 different geographical regions during two measurements periods of 7 and 4 months respectively. Our results identify two methods to circumvent the geo-restriction mechanisms. These methods consist of: (1) specialized ISPs/hosting providers which do not appear on the blocklists used by content providers to geo-restrict content and (2) the use of residential proxies, which due to their nature also do not appear in those blocklists. Our analysis shows that the ecosystem of the geo-unblocking VPN providers is highly dynamic, adapting their chosen geo-unblocking mechanisms not only over time, but also according to different geographical regions. 
  Exploring the evolution of the TLS certificate ecosystem    Syed Muhammad Farhan (Virginia Tech)  , Taejoong Chung (Virginia Tech)    Abstract  Paper  Video | Abstract:  A vast majority of popular communication protocols for the internet employ the use of TLS (Transport Layer Security) to secure communication. As a result, there have been numerous efforts including the introduction of Certificate Transparency logs and Free Automated CAs to improve the TLS certificate ecosystem. Our work highlights the effectiveness of these efforts using the Certificate Transparency dataset as well as certificates collected via full IPv4 scans. We show that a large proportion of invalid certificates still exists and outline the reasons why these certificates are invalid and where they are hosted. Additionally, an increasing proportion of certificates are issued by a handful of CAs using a handful of keys. Moreover, we show that the incorrect use of template certificates has led to incorrect SCTs being embedded in the certificates. Taken together, our results emphasize the continued involvement of the research community to improve the web’s PKI ecosystem. 
  Analysis of TLS Prefiltering for IDS Acceleration    Lukas Sismis (CESNET)  , Jan Korenek (Faculty of Information Technology Brno University of Technology)    Abstract  Paper  Video | Abstract:  Network intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) have proven to play a key role in securing networks. However, due to their computational complexity, the deployment is difficult and expensive. Therefore, many times the IDS is not powerful enough to handle all network traffic on high-speed network links without uncontrolled packet drop. High-speed packet processing can be achieved using many CPU cores or an appropriate acceleration. But the acceleration has to preserve the detection quality and has to be flexible to handle ever-emerging security threats. One of the common acceleration methods among intrusion detection/prevention systems is the bypass of encrypted packets of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. This is based on the fact that IDS/IPS cannot match signatures in the packet encrypted payload. The paper provides an analysis and comparison of available TLS bypass solutions and proposes a high-speed encrypted TLS Prefilter for further acceleration. We are able to demonstrate that using our technique, the IDS performance has tripled and at the same time detection results have resulted in a lower rate of false positives. It is designed as a software-only architecture with support for commodity cards. However, the architecture allows smooth transfer of the proposed method to the HW-based solution in Field-programmable gate array (FPGA) network interface cards (NICs). 
  A Measurement-Derived Functional Model for the Interaction between Congestion Control and QoE in Video Conferencing    Jia He (Georgia Institute of Technology)  , Mostafa Ammar (Georgia Institute of Technology)  , Ellen Zegura (Georgia Institute of Technology)    Abstract  Paper  Video | Abstract:  Video Conferencing Applications (VCAs) that support remote work and education have increased in use over the last two years, contributing to Internet bandwidth usage. VCA clients transmit video and audio to each other in peer-to-peer mode or through a bridge known as a Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU). Popular VCAs implement congestion control in the application layer over UDP and accomplish rate adjustment through video rate control, ultimately affecting end user Quality of Experience (QoE). Researchers have reported on the throughput and video metric performance of specific VCAs using structured experiments. Yet prior work rarely examines the interaction between congestion control mechanisms and rate adjustment techniques that produces the observed throughput and QoE metrics. Understanding this interaction at a functional level paves the way to explain observed performance, to pinpoint commonalities and key functional differences across VCAs, and to contemplate opportunities for innovation. To that end, we first design and conduct detailed measurements of three VCAs (WebRTC/Jitsi, Zoom, BlueJeans) to develop understanding of their congestion and video rate control mechanisms. We then use the measurement results to derive our functional models for the VCA client and SFU. Our models reveal the complexity of these systems and demonstrate how, despite some uniformity in function deployment, there is significant variability among the VCAs in the implementation of these functions.

  Efficient continuous latency monitoring with eBPF    Simon Sundberg (Karlstad University)  , Anna Brunstrom (Karlstad University)  , Simone Ferlin-Reiter (Red Hat)  , Toke Høiland-Jørgensen (Red Hat)  , Jesper Dangaard Brouer (Red Hat)    Abstract  Paper  Video | Abstract:  Network latency is a critical factor for the perceived quality of experience for many applications. With an increasing focus on interactive and real-time applications, which require reliable and low latency, the ability to continuously and efficiently monitor latency is becoming more important than ever. Always-on passive monitoring of latency can provide continuous latency metrics without injecting any traffic into the network. However, software-based monitoring tools often struggle to keep up with traffic as packet rates increase, especially on contemporary multi-Gbps interfaces. We investigate the feasibility of using eBPF to enable efficient passive network latency monitoring by implementing an evolved Passive Ping (ePPing). Our evaluation shows that ePPing delivers accurate RTT measurements and can handle over 1 Mpps, or correspondingly over 10 Gbps, on a single core, greatly improving on state-of-the-art software based solutions, such as PPing. 
  Back-to-the-Future Whois: An IP Address Attribution Service for Working with Historic Datasets    Florian Streibelt (Max Planck Institute for Informatics)  , Martina Lindorfer (TU Wien)  , Seda Gürses (TU Delft)  , Carlos H. Gañán (TU Delft)  , Tobias Fiebig (Max Planck Institute for Informatics)    Abstract  Paper  Video | Abstract:  Researchers and practitioners often face the issue of having to attribute an IP address to an organization. For current data this is comparably easy, using services like whois or other databases. Similarly, for historic data, several entities like the RIPE NCC provide websites that provide access to historic records. For large-scale network measurement work, though, researchers often have to attribute millions of addresses. For current data, Team Cymru provides a bulk whois service which allows bulk address attribution. However, at the time of writing, there is no service available that allows historic bulk attribution of IP addresses. Hence, in this paper, we introduce and evaluate our ‘Back-to-the-Future whois’ service, allowing historic bulk attribution of IP addresses on a daily granularity based on CAIDA Routeviews aggregates. We provide this service to the community for free, and also share our implementation so researchers can run instances themselves. 
  Evaluation of the ProgHW/SW Architectural Design Space of Bandwidth Estimation    Tianqi Fang (University of Nebraska-Lincoln)  , Lisong Xu (University of Nebraska-Lincoln)  , Witawas Srisa-an (University of Nebraska-Lincoln)  , Jay Patel (University of Nebraska-Lincoln)    Abstract  Paper  Video | Abstract:  Bandwidth estimation (BWE) is a fundamental functionality in congestion control, load balancing, and many network applications. Therefore, researchers have conducted numerous BWE evaluations to improve its estimation accuracy. Most current evaluations focus on the algorithmic aspects or network conditions of BWE. However, as the architectural aspects of BWE gradually become the bottleneck in multi-gigabit networks, many solutions derived from current works fail to provide satisfactory performance. In contrast, this paper focuses on the architectural aspects of BWE in the current trend of programmable hardware (ProgHW) and software (SW) co-designs. Our work makes several new findings to improve BWE accuracy from the architectural perspective. For instance, we show that offloading components that can directly affect inter-packet delay (IPD) is an effective way to improve BWE accuracy. In addition, to handle the architectural deployment difficulty not appeared in past studies, we propose a modularization method to increase evaluation efficiency. 
  A Characterization of Route Variability in LEO Satellite Networks    Vaibhav Bhosale (Georgia Institute of Technology)  , Ahmed Saeed (Georgia Institute of Technology)  , Ketan Bhardwaj (Georgia Institute of Technology)  , Ada Gavrilovska (Georgia Institute of Technology)    Abstract  Paper  Video | Abstract:  LEO satellite networks possess highly dynamic topologies, with satellites moving at 27,000 km/hour to maintain their orbit. As satellites move, the characteristics of the satellite network routes change, triggering rerouting events. Frequent rerouting can cause poor performance for path-adaptive algorithms (e.g., congestion control). In this paper, we provide a thorough characterization of route variability in LEO satellite networks, focusing on route churn and RTT variability. We show that high route churn is common, with most paths used for less than half of their lifetime. With some paths used for just a few seconds. This churn is also unnecessary with rerouting leading to marginal gains in most cases (e.g., less than a 15% reduction in RTT). Moreover, we show that the high route churn is harmful to network utilization and congestion control performance. By examining RTT variability, we find that the smallest achievable RTT between two ground stations can increase by 2.5× as satellites move in their orbits. We show that the magnitude of RTT variability depends on the location of the communicating ground stations, exhibiting a spatial structure. Finally, we show that adding more satellites, and providing more routes between stations, does not necessarily reduce route variability. Rather, constellation configuration (i.e., the number of orbits and their inclination) plays a more significant role. We hope that the findings of this study will help with designing more robust routing algorithms for LEO satellite networks.

  as2org+ : Enriching AS-to-Organization Mappings with PeeringDB    Augusto Arturi (Universidad de Buenos Aires)  , Esteban Carisimo (Northwestern University)  , Fabian Bustamante (Northwestern University)    Abstract  Paper  Video | Abstract:  An organization-level topology of the Internet is a valuable resource with uses that range from the study of organizations' footprints and Internet centralization trends, to analysis of the dynamics of the Internet's corporate structures as result of (de)mergers and acquisitions. Current approaches to infer this topology rely exclusively on WHOIS databases and are thus impacted by its limitations, including errors and outdated data. We argue that a collaborative, operator-oriented database such as PeeringDB can bring a complementary perspective from the legally-bounded information available in WHOIS records. We present as2org+, a new framework that leverages self-reported information available on PeeringDB to boost the state-of-the-art WHOIS-based methodologies. We discuss the challenges and opportunities with using PeeringDB records for AS-to-organization mappings, present the design of as2org+ and demonstrate its value identifying companies operating in multiple continents and mergers and acquisitions over a five-year period. 
  RPKI Time-of-Flight: Tracking Delays in the Management, Control, and Data Planes    Romain Fontugne (IIJ Research Lab)  , Amreesh Phokeer (Internet Society)  , Cristel Pelsser (UCLouvain)  , Kevin Vermeulen (LAAS-CNRS)  , Randy Bush (Internet Initiative Japan & Arrcus Inc)    Abstract  Paper  Video | Abstract:  As RPKI is becoming part of ISPs’ daily operations and Route Origin Validation is getting widely deployed, one wonders how long it takes for the effect of RPKI changes to appear in the data plane. Does an operator that adds, fixes, or removes a Route Origin Autho- rization (ROA) have time to brew coffee or rather enjoy a long meal before the Internet routing infrastructure integrates the new information and the operator can assess the changes and resume work? The chain of ROA publication, from creation at Certification Authorities all the way to the routers and the effect on the data plane, involves a large number of players and is not instantaneous and is often dominated by ad hoc administrative decisions. This is the first comprehensive study to measure the entire ecosystem of ROA manipulation by all five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), propagation on the management plane to Relying Parties (RPs) and to routers; measure the effect on BGP as seen by global control plane monitors; and finally measure the effects on data plane latency and reachability. We found that RIRs usually publish new RPKI information within five minutes, except APNIC which averages ten minutes slower. We observe significant disparities in ISPs reaction time to new RPKI information, ranging from a few minutes to one hour. The delay for ROA deletion is significantly longer than for ROA creation as RPs and BGP strive to maintain reachability. Incidentally we found and reported significant issues in the management plane of two RIRs and a Tier1 network.
