1. EICS_1 conference:
EICS   
 The ACM SIGCHI Symposium on  
 Engineering Interactive Computing Systems  
 EICS is an international conference devoted to all aspects of engineering usable and effective interactive computing systems, ranging from traditional workstation-based interactive systems to those involving new and emerging modalities (e.g., gesture), applications (e.g., mobile and ubiquitous games) and development methods (e.g., extreme programming).  
 EICS focuses on tools, techniques and methods for designing and developing interactive systems. EICS brings together people who study or practice the engineering of interactive systems, drawing from the HCI, Software Engineering, Requirements Engineering, CSCW, Ubiquitous & Pervasive Systems, and Game Development communities.  
 EICS papers are published in the ACM journal Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction - EICS track  (or PACMHCI-EICS). More information on PACMHCI-EICS can be found here  .

  About the Conference  
 Motivation   
 Information modelling is becoming increasingly important for researchers, designers, and users of information systems with artificial intelligence. The amount and complexity of information, the number of abstraction levels, and the size of databases and knowledge bases are continuously growing. Conceptual modelling is one of the sub-areas of information modelling and AI modelling. The aim of this conference is to bring together experts from different areas of computer science, AI and other disciplines who have a common interest in understanding and solving problems on information modelling and knowledge bases, as well as applying the results of research to practice. We also aim to recognize and study new areas of Information modelling, knowledge bases and AI to which more attention should be paid. Philosophy and logic, cognitive science, knowledge management, linguistics and cyber-physical modelling are relevant areas, too. The conference will have three categories of presentations, i.e. full papers, short papers and position papers.  
 Background   
 7. AI System Modelling:  Cyber and Physical System Modelling; Image Processing; Natural Language Processing; Computer Vision; Biological Analysis; Responsible AI.  
 All papers (full/short/position) accepted and presented in the conference are published in the conference preprint (e-book having ISSN / ISBN) by the local organizers (distributed in the conference) and after the conference in the final journal-paper publication.  
 After the conference, authors have the opportunity to improve their papers based on the feedback at the conference. The final publication is published in the Series “ Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence  ” by IOS Press (Amsterdam)  . The books “Information Modelling and Knowledge Bases Vol. n” are edited by the Editing Committee. It has the right to propose obligatory improvements as a precondition to the publication. It has the right to withdraw papers that do not follow the given guidelines and technical style. In addition to IOS press publication, we have invitation to publish some papers in ECTI-Transactions on Computer and Information Technology (ECTI-CIT)  . The papers are selected by the Editorial Board of the Journal.  
 In all editorial issues, please contact the editing committee.

   It was organised by the members of the Data Technologies Laboratory, Institute of Informatics from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The event was attended by 23 experts from Japan, Lithuania, Finland, Germany and the Czech Republic.  
 The conference   brought together experts from different areas of computer science and other disciplines who share a common understanding and problem-solving of information modelling and knowledge bases and the application of research results in practice. The conference programme was complemented by two invited speakers, József Györkös from the University of Maribor, who gave a lecture on Open Science – a reality check within ATHENA European University  , and Bernhard Thalheim from the Christian-Albrechts University of Kiel, who gave a lecture on Modelology – A New Scientific and Engineering Discipline: The Science and Practice of Models and Modelling  .  
 The conference started with the 4th Asian-European Summer School of AI-5D Consortium  , which focused on covering Global & Environmental AI in Nature and Society. The speakers from Japan, Indonesia, Thailand and Slovenia presented topics such as “AI System for Ocean Nature”, “AI System for Earthquake Density Measurement”, “AI-based Plastic Garbage Collection project” and “Fairness of AI”. The summer school was held in a hybrid style.  
 Participants also enjoyed a varied social programme with a visit to the Old Vine Museum, wine tasting, folklore performance, the Rogatec Open Air Museum, Olimje Monastery and Deer Ridge, and a guided tour of Maribor.

 Over 30 years after its first edition, EKAW is still going from strength to strength. This demonstrates the vitality and robust state of health of this area of research and also confirms that, while the landscape has changed so much in the past 30 years, the key issues to do with effective knowledge engineering and management are still as relevant today as they were 30 years ago.
