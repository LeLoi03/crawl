 Call for participation  
 We warmly invite you to submit a research or practitioner paper to the 25th annual Australasian Computing Education Conference (ACE'23). ACE is a high-quality international conference, run in-cooperation with SIGCSE, that provides a forum for educators and researchers to share innovations and insights in computing education.  
 ACE 2023 will run in parallel with several other events as part of Australasian Computer Science Week  (ACSW), 30th January-3rd February, 2023 at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.  
 In addition to publishing research from leading computing education researchers, the ACE community is very welcoming and supportive of researchers who are new to computing education research, and practitioners who wish to discuss and develop good computing education practice. Topics of interest for the conference include, but are not limited to:  
 the use of technology in computing education; 
  valuations of alternative approaches 
 The Program Committee  will select the papers to appear based on their potential to enhance learning outcomes in computing courses. Both research papers and practitioner papers must be between 5 and 10 pages in length (inclusive of any references). To illustrate the variety of work presented at ACE, you may wish to view recent conference proceedings which are available on the ACM Digital Library:

 Friday, 14th October 2022: submission deadline and bidding period begins 
  Tuesday, 18th October 2022: bidding period ends and reviewing begins 
  Friday, 4th November 2022: reviewing period ends and discussion begins 
  Monday, 14th November 2022: author notifications 
 Submissions should be in two-column format (i.e. use "sigconf" style in the documentclass for Latex) and should use the ACM SIG Proceedings template (available in Latex and Word). Submissions should be made to EasyChair in PDF format:  
 Papers on research and innovations may be in the context of formal courses or self-directed learning; they may involve, for example, introductory programming, service courses, capstone courses, specialist undergraduate or postgraduate topics, or industry-related short courses. We welcome submissions directed at issues of current and local importance, as well as topics of international interest. Such topics may include the transition from school to university, articulation between vocational and university education, quality management in teaching, teaching people from other cultures, globalisation, attracting and retaining female students, online, mobile and blended learning. Research papers would typically describe research questions, and address these through the careful presentation of methods, results, and limitations, while clearly stating the contribution of the work.  
 PRACTITIONER PAPERS   
 In addition to research papers, ACE provides the opportunity for teachers to demonstrate new educational tools, and to share interesting teaching resources, assignments, and techniques that may be of broad interest to the community. We encourage the submission of papers that present interesting ways to teach challenging concepts, engaging activities that promote student learning, and compelling assignments. Practitioner papers would typically describe a computing education approach or tool, the context of its use, and present a rich reflection on how it worked in practice.  
 STUDENT PAPERS   
 Student authors (of research or practitioner papers) may be eligible for a CORE Student Research award. To qualify as a student paper:  
 the major contribution must be made by a student author, who must be listed as first author; and 
  at the time of submission, the authors must indicate that their paper is to be classified as a student paper, and provide a letter of confirmation from the student’s supervisor or Head of Department by email to the conference chairs (ace23@easychair.org). 
 REVIEW PROCESS   
 Guidelines for authors  
 Papers must be in English and must be original contributions that have not been published previously, nor submitted to other conferences or journals in parallel with this conference.  
 Papers must be between 5 and 10 pages long (inclusive of any references). Papers are required to conform to the formatting guidelines of the ACM Conference paper guides. Authors should use the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) – SIG Proceedings Template:  
 LaTeX template 
  MS Word template 
 If you are using Latex, use the “sigconf” style in documentclass (which is the default if you create a project using the LaTeX link above). Page length includes references. The accepted format for submissions is Portable Document Format (PDF). Microsoft Word and LaTeX template files are available at the website link above. We recommend using the LaTeX template where possible, but if you choose to use MS Word, then please use the Interim Template listed on the ACM conference proceedings page listed above.  
 By submitting to the conference, authors accept that they are aware of the Guidelines on Research Practice in Computer Science by the Computer Research and Education Association (CORE). In particular, authors are encouraged to review the points on authorship.  
 Please review the Guidelines for authors on this site, before submitting.  
 Double-blind reviewing requirements:  It is standard practice that identities of reviewers are not made known to authors. The double-blind review process extends this principle so that reviewers do not know the identity of authors. This process requires authors to refrain from identifying themselves in their own paper. Below are some guidelines for anonymising your paper.  
 If you are using the ACM template correctly, you can tell it to create an anonymous version of the pdf; this will take care of explicit mentions of the author names. 
  If you are not yet using the template (you should be!), in place of the usual author and address details, put “Author details suppressed” or something equivalent. Where there are more than three authors contributing to a paper, limit the number of author spaces to three in the anonymised version. 
  Refrain from references to your university or campus by name. If you feel that a description of your university is in some way salient to the paper, use generalities. For example, use "our University" instead of "Maintown University of Technology". 
  Avoid expressions like “In earlier work we …” followed by a citation of a paper authored by yourself. 
  If you have an acknowledgements section, omit it for the blind submission. 
  Do not link to webpages in your anonymised paper. 
  Once you have a pdf copy of your paper, see how well it is blinded. Some PDF creation software includes document properties such as the author name or institution. Some operating systems will show such document properties when the cursor hovers over the file name. Be especially careful to disguise or remove these properties. 
 In general, apply good judgement when preparing your submission, to maintain the integrity of the double-blind process. Submissions that allow the author to be identified may be returned to you for editing at short notice, or may be rejected outright.  
 Registration for ACSW:  At least one author of an accepted paper must register to attend ACSW. When submitting a paper, you will be asked to nominate who will be attending ACE and presenting the paper if it is accepted. Papers not presented at ACE will be withdrawn from the proceedings. Please see the ACSW site for registration.

   Conference Call for Papers  
 The Sixteenth International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interaction, ACHI 2023, was proposed as a result of a paradigm shift in the most recent achievements and future trends in human interactions with increasingly complex systems. Adaptive and knowledge-based user interfaces, universal accessibility, human-robot interaction, agent-driven human computer interaction, and sharable mobile devices are a few of these trends. ACHI 2023 also brings a suite of specific domain applications, such as gaming, e-learning, social, medicine, teleconferencing and engineering.  
  ACHI 2023 continues a series of events targeting traditional and advanced paradigms for computer-human interaction in multi-technology environments. The conference covers also fundamentals on interfaces and models, and highlights new challenging industrial applications and research topics.  
  We solicit both academic, research, and industrial contributions. We welcome technical papers presenting research and practical results, position papers addressing the pros and cons of specific proposals, such as those being discussed in the standard fora or in industry consortia, survey papers addressing the key problems and solutions on any of the above topics short papers on work in progress, and panel proposals.  
  Tutorials on specific related topics and panels on challenging areas are encouraged.  
  The topics suggested by the conference can be discussed in term of concepts, state of the art, research, standards, implementations, running experiments, applications, and industrial case studies. Authors are invited to submit complete unpublished papers, which are not under review in any other conference or journal in the following, but not limited to, topic areas.   
 Overview  
 Top Research Topics at Advances in Computer-Human Interaction?  
  Artificial intelligence (13.31%) 
  Human–computer interaction, Artificial intelligence, Multimedia, Usability and Simulation are among the topics commonly tackled in Advances in Computer-Human Interaction. Topics in Human–computer interaction explored in the conference were investigated in conjunction with research in Context (language use), User interface, Task (project management) and Robot. Human–robot interaction is a focus of the presented Robot works and it dives deep in Human–robot interaction.  
 The concepts on Artificial intelligence presented in it can also apply to other research fields, including Computer vision and Natural language processing. The conference focused on Multimedia research but expanded to cover World Wide Web. In particular, the Usability works presented emphasize discussions on Usability engineering.  
 The event emphasizes research on Simulation, which includes concerns such as Haptic technology.  
 What are the most cited papers published at the conference?  
  Research areas of the most cited articles at Advances in Computer-Human Interaction:  
 The conference publications cover a variety of subjects, including Human–computer interaction, Artificial intelligence, Robot, Multimedia and Knowledge management. The conference articles aim to investigate interdisciplinary topics such as Human–computer interaction and User group. Task (project management) and Computer vision are some topics wherein Artificial intelligence research discussed in the most cited publications has an impact.  
 What topics the last edition of the conference is best known for?  
 Artificial intelligence 
  The Internet 
  The previous edition focused in particular on these issues:  
 Advances in Computer-Human Interaction primarily focuses on research topics in Human–computer interaction, Artificial intelligence, Robot, Usability and Multimedia. Human–computer interaction research in the conference involves the investigation of Context (language use) studies, all of which are linked to disciplines such as Gesture. The Artificial intelligence research presented in it explores the relationship between Computer vision and the closely related topic of Haptic technology.  
 Most of the works presented in the conference deals with Robot but it intersects with the subject of Simulation. The Usability research presented in Advances in Computer-Human Interaction explores the relationship between Software engineering and the closely related topic of Software development process and Software. The studies tackled, which mainly focus on Human–robot interaction, apply to Humanoid robot as well.  
 The most cited articles from the last conference are:

 Publication chance based on affiliation  
 The publication chance index shows the ratio of articles published by the best research institutions at the conference edition to all articles published within that conference. The best research institutions were selected based on the largest number of articles published during all editions of the conference.  
 Returning Authors Index  
 A very common phenomenon observed among researchers publishing scientific articles is the intentional selection of conferences they have already attended in the past. In particular, it is worth analyzing the case when the authors participate in the same conference from year to year.  
 The Returning Authors Index presented below illustrates the ratio of authors who participated in both a given as well as the previous edition of the conference in relation to all participants in a given year.

 Returning Institution Index  
 The graph below shows the Returning Institution Index, illustrating the ratio of institutions that participated in both a given and the previous edition of the conference in relation to all affiliations present in a given year.

 The experience to innovation index  
 Our experience to innovation index was created to show a cross-section of the experience level of authors publishing at a conference. The index includes the authors publishing at the last edition of a conference  , grouped by total number of publications throughout their academic career (P) and the total number of citations of these publications ever received (C).  
 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups:  
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25),
