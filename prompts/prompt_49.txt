  SCOPE  
 COMPLEXIS – The International Conference on Complexity, Future Information Systems and Risk, aims at becoming a yearly meeting place for presenting and discussing innovative views on all aspects of Complex Information Systems, in different areas such as Informatics, Telecommunications, Computational Intelligence, Biology, Biomedical Engineering and Social Sciences. Information is pervasive in many areas of human activity – perhaps all – and complexity is a characteristic of current Exabyte-sized, highly connected and hyper dimensional, information systems. COMPLEXIS is expected to provide an overview of the state of the art as well as upcoming trends, and to promote discussion about the potential of new methodologies, technologies and application areas of complex information systems, in the academic and corporate world.  
  COMPLEXIS seeks papers reporting research work, applications or case-studies, on topics indicated below in the section “Conference Areas”. Papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, tools and techniques and general survey papers indicating future directions are also encouraged. Both technological and social-oriented papers are accepted. All papers must describe original work, not previously published or submitted to another conference. Accepted papers, presented at the conference by one of the authors, will be published in the Proceedings of COMPLEXIS under an ISBN, and will be indexed by major indexes. Acceptance will be based on quality, relevance and originality. Both full research reports (regular papers) and work-in-progress reports (position papers) are welcome. There will be both oral and poster sessions.  
  Special sessions, dedicated to case-studies and focused presentations, as well as tutorials dedicated to technical/scientific topics are also envisaged: companies interested in presenting their products/methodologies or researchers interested in holding a tutorial, workshop or special session are invited to contact the conference secretariat or visit the conference website.

 COMPSAC 2023 Theme: Resilient Computing and Computing for Resilience  
  in a Sustainable Cyber-Physical World   
 The last few renditions of COMPSAC, which have been online because of COVID-19, have had profound consequences on our academic and industrial R&D communities. Yet these communities have shown resilience  in the face of this adversity. Accordingly, we are introducing a new vision for both the theoretical and practical aspects of the fields of interest of our participating communities: resilient computing and computing for resilience  .  
 During the pandemic-induced chaos of the last few years, the world has mainly managed to resist chaos and maintain a sense of order and stability. This resistance has brought a new focus and meaning to our technology research direction, i.e., resiliency, availability, and sustainability. As we go forward, we have learned that we must carefully prepare a variety of alternatives, keep them in operation, and continue to adapt them and us to changing circumstances. For instance, the notion of security can be interpreted as the maintenance of high availability. It can also be said that resilience is the ability to keep the lights burning, even if the quality of stability is significantly reduced.  
 Inspired by these thoughts, COMPSAC 2023, which is organized as a tight union of symposia, will focus on all the innovative research aspects of computing in a sustainable cyber-physical world,  including resilience computing, security, healthcare analytics, e  -government and e  -society, metaverse worlds, intelligent autonomous systems, Internet of Things networks, explainable artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and virtual augmented reality. The technical program will include keynote addresses, research papers, industrial case studies, fast abstracts, a doctoral symposium, poster sessions, workshops, and tutorials on emerging and important topics related to the conference theme. Highlights of the conference will include plenary and specialized panels that will address the technical challenges facing researchers and practitioners who are driving fundamental changes in Computers, Software, and Applications in Resilience Computing Systems and Tools. Panels will also address cultural and societal challenges raised by rapidly changing communication norms concerning computing and collaboration.  
 Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research work and industrial practice reports. Simultaneous submission to other publication venues is not permitted except as highlighted in the COMPSAC 2023 JC & CJ program. All submissions must adhere to IEEE Conference Publishing Policies  and will be vetted through the IEEE CrossCheck  portal.

  Abstract    
 We consider networks of processes that all execute the same finite-state protocol and communicate via a rendez-vous mechanism. When a process requests a rendez-vous, another process can respond to it and they both change their control states accordingly. We focus here on a specific semantics, called non-blocking, where the process requesting a rendez-vous can change its state even if no process can respond to it. In this context, we study the parameterised coverability problem of a configuration, which consists in determining whether there is an initial number of processes and an execution allowing to reach a configuration bigger than a given one. We show that this problem is EXPSPACE-complete and can be solved in polynomial time if the protocol is partitioned into two sets of states, the states from which a process can request a rendez-vous and the ones from which it can answer one. We also prove that the problem of the existence of an execution bringing all the processes in a final state is undecidable in our context. These two problems can be solved in polynomial time with the classical rendez-vous semantics.

  Abstract    
 Context-free session types describe structured patterns of communication on heterogeneously typed channels, allowing the specification of protocols unconstrained by tail recursion. The enhanced expressive power provided by non-regular recursion comes, however, at the cost of the decidability of subtyping, even if equivalence is still decidable. We present an approach to subtyping context-free session types based on a novel kind of observational preorder we call XYZW-simulation, which generalizes XY-simulation (also known as covariant-contravariant simulation) and therefore also bisimulation and plain simulation. We further propose a subtyping algorithm that we prove to be sound, and present an empirical evaluation in the context of a compiler for a programming language. Due to the general nature of the simulation relation upon which it is built, this algorithm may also find applications in other domains.

  Abstract    
 Automatic structures are structures whose universe and relations can be represented as regular languages. It follows from the standard closure properties of regular languages that the first-order theory of an automatic structure is decidable. While existential quantifiers can be eliminated in linear time by application of a homomorphism, universal quantifiers are commonly eliminated via the identity ∀x.Φ≡¬(∃x.¬Φ). If Φ is represented in the standard way as an NFA, a priori this approach results in a doubly exponential blow-up. However, the recent literature has shown that there are classes of automatic structures for which universal quantifiers can be eliminated by different means without this blow-up by treating them as first-class citizens and not resorting to double complementation. While existing lower bounds for some classes of automatic structures show that a singly exponential blow-up is unavoidable when eliminating a universal quantifier, it is not known whether there may be better approaches that avoid the naïve doubly exponential blow-up, perhaps at least in restricted settings. In this paper, we answer this question negatively and show that there is a family of NFA representing automatic relations for which the minimal NFA recognising the language after eliminating a single universal quantifier is doubly exponential, and deciding whether this language is empty is ExpSpace-complete.

  Abstract    
 We consider history-determinism, a restricted form of non-determinism, for Vector Addition Systems with States (VASS) when used as acceptors to recognise languages of finite words. History-determinism requires that the non-deterministic choices can be resolved on-the-fly; based on the past and without jeopardising acceptance of any possible continuation of the input word. Our results show that the history-deterministic (HD) VASS sit strictly between deterministic and non-deterministic VASS regardless of the number of counters. We compare the relative expressiveness of HD systems, and closure-properties of the induced language classes, with coverability and reachability semantics, and with and without ε-labelled transitions. Whereas in dimension 1, inclusion and regularity remain decidable, from dimension two onwards, HD-VASS with suitable resolver strategies, are essentially able to simulate 2-counter Minsky machines, leading to several undecidability results: It is undecidable whether a VASS is history-deterministic, or if a language equivalent history-deterministic VASS exists. Checking language inclusion between history-deterministic 2-VASS is also undecidable.

  Abstract    
 The interaction among components in a system is traditionally modeled by a game. In the turned-based setting, the players in the game jointly move a token along the game graph, with each player deciding where to move the token in vertices she controls. The objectives of the players are modeled by ω-regular winning conditions, and players whose objectives are satisfied get rewards. Thus, the game is non-zero-sum, and we are interested in its stable outcomes. In particular, in the rational-synthesis problem, we seek a strategy for the system player that guarantees the satisfaction of the system’s objective in all rational environments. In this paper, we study an extension of the traditional setting by trading of control. In our game, the players may pay each other in exchange for directing the token also in vertices they do not control. The utility of each player then combines the reward for the satisfaction of her objective and the profit from the trading. The setting combines challenges from ω-regular graph games with challenges in pricing, bidding, and auctions in classical game theory. We study the theoretical properties of parity trading games: best-response dynamics, existence and search for Nash equilibria, and measures for equilibrium inefficiency. We also study the rational-synthesis problem and analyze its tight complexity in various settings.

 In this paper we study a Separation Logic of Relations (SLR) and compare its expressiveness to (Monadic) Second Order Logic [(M)SO]. SLR is based on the well-known Symbolic Heap fragment of Separation Logic, whose formulæare composed of points-to assertions, inductively defined predicates, with the separating conjunction as the only logical connective. SLR generalizes the Symbolic Heap fragment by supporting general relational atoms, instead of only points-to assertions. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to finite relational structures, and hence only consider Weak (M)SO, where quantification ranges over finite sets. Our main results are that SLR and MSO are incomparable on structures of unbounded treewidth, while SLR can be embedded in SO in general. Furthermore, MSO becomes a strict subset of SLR, when the treewidth of the models is bounded by a parameter and all vertices attached to some hyperedge belong to the interpretation of a fixed unary relation symbol. We also discuss the problem of identifying a fragment of SLR that is equivalent to MSO over models of bounded treewidth.

  Abstract    
 Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) protocols that are based on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are attractive due to their many advantages in asynchronous blockchain systems. These DAG-based protocols can be viewed as a simulation of some BFT protocol on a DAG. Many DAG-based BFT protocols rely on randomization, since they are used for agreement and ordering of transactions, which cannot be achieved deterministically in asynchronous systems. Randomization is achieved either through local sources of randomness, or by employing shared objects that provide a common source of randomness, e.g., common coins. A DAG simulation of a randomized protocol should be faithful, in the sense that it precisely preserves the properties of the original BFT protocol, and in particular, their probability distributions. We argue that faithfulness is ensured by a forward simulation. We show how to faithfully simulate any BFT protocol that uses public coins and shared objects, like common coins.

  Abstract    
 Linearizability is a standard correctness criterion for concurrent algorithms, typically proved by establishing the algorithms' linearization points (LP). However, LPs often hinder abstraction, and for some algorithms such as the timestamped stack, it is unclear how to even identify their LPs. In this paper, we show how to develop declarative proofs of linearizability by foregoing LPs and instead employing axiomatization of so-called visibility relations. While visibility relations have been considered before for the timestamped stack, our study is the first to show how to derive the axiomatization systematically and intuitively from the sequential specification of the stack. In addition to the visibility relation, a novel separability relation emerges to generalize real-time precedence of procedure invocation. The visibility and separability relations have natural definitions for the timestamped stack, and enable a novel proof that reduces the algorithm to a simplified form where the timestamps are generated atomically.

  Abstract    
 Nondeterministic good-for-MDPs (GFM) automata are for MDP model checking and reinforcement learning what good-for-games automata are for reactive synthesis: a more compact alternative to deterministic automata that displays nondeterminism, but only so much that it can be resolved locally, such that a syntactic product can be analysed. GFM has recently been introduced as a property for reinforcement learning, where the simpler Büchi acceptance conditions it allows to use is key. However, while there are classic and novel techniques to obtain automata that are GFM, there has not been a decision procedure for checking whether or not an automaton is GFM. We show that GFM-ness is decidable and provide an EXPTIME decision procedure as well as a PSPACE-hardness proof.
