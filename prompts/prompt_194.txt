 JURIX 2023: The Thirty-sixth Annual Conference, Maastricht, the Netherlands, 18–20 December 2023   
 Series  Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications    
 Published  2023   
 Editors  Giovanni Sileno, Jerry Spanakis, Gijs van Dijck   
 Three invited speakers from different and complementary areas honoured JURIX 2023 by kindly agreeing to deliver their keynote lectures: prof. Jaap Hage, prof. Piek Vossen, and prof. Iris van Rooij.  
 Iris van Rooij is professor of Computational Cognitive Science at Radboud University, and principal investigator at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour. She is also a Guest Professor in the Department of Linguistics, Cognitive Science, and Semiotics, and the Interacting Minds Centre at Aarhus University, Denmark. Her research interests lie at the interface of psychology, philosophy and theoretical computer science, with a focus on the theoretical foundations of the computational explanations of cognition.  
 This year, continuing a tradition, JURIX has also been accompanied by satellite co-located events: four workshops (ALP 2023, AI & Access to Justice, AI4Legs-II, Annotation of Legal Data), and the Doctoral Consortium. ALP 2023 – the first workshop on AI, Law and Philosophy – aims to take the time for philosophical reflection on where we stand and what can be expected from the interaction between AI and Law. The workshop brings together young researchers and experienced experts interested in the interface between AI, law and philosophy, aiming to connect contemporary tracks of research in the fields of AI and Law to the tradition of computational legal theory. The AI & Access to Justice workshop aims to bring together lawyers, computer scientists, and social-science researchers to discuss findings and proposals around how AI might be used to improve access to justice, as well as how to hold AI models accountable for the public good. AI4Legs-II – the second Workshop on AI for Legislation – aims to discuss the state-of-the-art of the most advanced applications of AI in support of better regulation and law-making systems, applying interdisciplinary instruments drawn from the philosophy of law, constitutional law, legal informatics, AI & Law, computational linguistics, computer science, HCI, and legal design. The Annotation of Legal Data Workshop aims to provide a platform for in-depth discussions, knowledge sharing, demonstrations, and practical insights into the challenges and opportunities of annotating legal data. The workshop is designed to bring together researchers and experts interested in exploring the nuances of annotating legal data, focusing on topics such as software tools, annotator training, inter-rater and intra-rater reliability, and the publication of data and metadata.

 Abstract   
  In recent years a considerable amount of research has been devoted to formal theories of precedential constraint. In this note I consider a recent paper which explores the use of factor hierarchies in this connection. In that work it was shown both that cases constrained with the use of a hierarchy may be unconstrained if the hierarchy is flattened, and that cases unconstrained with a hierarchy may be constrained when the hierarchy is flattened. I discuss the nature of factor hierarchies and attempt to explain these results.

 Abstract   
  Data-driven AI systems can make the right decisions for the wrong reasons, which can lead to irresponsible behavior. The rationale of such machine learning models can be evaluated and improved using a previously introduced hybrid method. This method, however, was tested using synthetic data under ideal circumstances, whereas labelled datasets in the legal domain are usually relatively small and often contain missing facts or inconsistencies. In this paper, we therefore investigate rationales under such imperfect conditions. We apply the hybrid method to machine learning models that are trained on court cases, generated from a structured representation of Article 6 of the ECHR, as designed by legal experts. We first evaluate the rationale of our models, and then improve it by creating tailored training datasets. We show that applying the rationale evaluation and improvement method can yield relevant improvements in terms of both performance and soundness of rationale, even under imperfect conditions.

 Abstract   
  One way of reasoning with uncertainties in the context of law is to use probabilities. However, methods for reasoning about the probability of guilt in a court case requires us to specify a prior probability of guilt, which is the probability of guilt before any evidence is known. There is no accepted approach for specifying the prior probability of guilt but multiple solutions have been proposed. In this paper, we consider three approaches: a prior that is based on the population, a prior based on the number of agents that have similar opportunity as the suspect and a prior that represents a legal norm. For comparing and evaluating the approaches, we use an agent-based model as a ground truth in which all probabilities are known. With the data generated in the ground truth model, we investigate how the choice of prior influences the posterior probability of guilt for both guilty and innocent agents. Using a decision threshold, we can determine the effect of the three approaches on the rates of correct and incorrect convictions and acquittals. We find that the opportunity prior results in higher rates of both correct convictions and false convictions and requires more assumptions and access to data and knowledge than the legal prior and population prior.

 Abstract   
  This paper presents a formal model of specific reasoning patterns in conflict of laws (CoL). CoL arises when multiple countries have jurisdiction due to the diverse nationalities of the involved factors. When initiating legal action in one country, the question of which country’s substantial law to apply emerges, possibly involving the CoL regulations of other countries (in cases of transmission and renvoi). Moreover, parties contemplating legal action in a case falling under CoL often engage in a deliberation process known as forum shopping: determining which country’s CoL regulations would result in the most favorable outcome for them. Our model integrates deontic logic (specifically Input/Output logic) with proof theory and formal argumentation techniques to model both types of reasoning.

 Abstract   
  Given a common pool of facts and legal rules, Judges on a panel may form different justifications for decisions, which are then voted upon. It is clear that a Judge’s personal values and purposes play in developing their opinion, which is a form of teleological reasoning. The paper introduces the Value-based Formal Reasoning (VFR) framework, which describes how a Judge’s personal values can be used in the construction of a justification for a decision.

 Abstract   
  This paper introduces a framework of conceptual structures allocated to statutory expressions during interpretive heuresis. Drawing from cognitive science research on conceptual structures, the study seeks to enhance existing computational models of legal reasoning across various domains. A comprehensive set of conceptual structures applicable in statutory interpretation is reconstructed. This framework increases awareness of potential interpretive options and contributes to the transparency of legal reasoning.

 Abstract   
  Existing approaches to modelling contracts often rely on deontic logic to reason about norms, and only treat time qualitatively. Using L4, a textual domain specific language (DSL) for the law, we offer a more operational interpretation of norms, based on states and transitions, that also accounts for the granular timing of events. In this paper, we present a higher-level rendering of the loan agreement from Flood & Goodenough in L4, and an accompanying operational semantics amenable to execution and static analysis. We also implement this semantics in Maude and show how this lets us visualize the execution of the loan agreement.

 Abstract   
  The EU AI Act is the first step toward a comprehensive legal framework for AI. It introduces provisions for AI systems based on their risk levels in relation to fundamental rights. Providers of AI systems must conduct Conformity Assessments before market placement. Recent amendments added Fundamental Rights Impact Assessments for high-risk AI system users, focusing on compliance with EU and national laws, fundamental rights, and potential impacts on EU values. The paper suggests that automating business process compliance can help standardize these assessments and outlines some methodological guidelines.

 Abstract   
  Insurance Portfolio Analysis (IPA) is the process of comparing multiple, potentially overlapping insurance portfolios with an eye to detecting and characterizing redundancies and gaps in coverage. Unfortunately, insurees usually do not have the time or patience to compare policies from multiple insurance providers, and they often do not have the legal background needed to understand the complex legal wording of the contracts associated with those policies. Past work has shown that, by encoding policies as logic programs, it is possible to automatically determine compliance of specific claims with a policy’s terms and conditions. In this paper, we show that it is also possible to automatically analyze multiple-policy portfolios for gaps and redundancies by assessing coverage over multiple hypothetical claims. We formalize the process of IPA and show how to use well-studied techniques for logic program containment testing to automate the process.

 Abstract   
  To exhaustively understand the impact of rule amendments and unforeseen cases on existing norms, it requires connecting their rule-based and case-based representations. However, those connections have not been explored in depth, especially for norms that are represented as soft constraints. This paper aims to explore the connection between constraint hierarchies and case models as representative formalisms of rule-based and case-based representations of soft-constraint norms respectively. To explore the connection, we express norm scopes and preferences in both formalisms as diagrams. Based on tightening and arranging diagrams, we found the translation of constraint hierarchies with one constraint per level into case models. This provides new insights into understanding prototypical cases made by rule-based soft-constraint norms.
