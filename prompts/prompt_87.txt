 EuroXR Association  would like to cordially invite you to contribute to the 20th EuroXR International Conference –   Eu  roXR  2023 ,   to be held collocated with  the Immersive Tech Week   from November 29th to December 1st  2023, at De Doelen,  in Rotterdam, The Netherlands.    
 ABOUT   
 Apart from annually gathering the EuroXR members for the association life, the focus of EuroXR conference is on novel VR/AR/MR technologies, including software systems, display technology, interaction devices, and applications. Besides papers on the latest scientific results and highlights from many application fields, the EuroXR conference series aims at creating a unique human-dimension framework, interconnecting European and international XR communities, for knowledge cross-fertilisations between researchers, technology providers, and end-users.   
 In-person conferences provide a unique opportunity for researchers to meet, chat, and catch up on the latest developments in the field, as well as absorb all the excellent talks and demos. It is also super important to build networks, especially for early career researchers.   
 Together we drive XR forward    
 The EuroXR 2023 Conference is proudly co-organized by Immersive Tech Week (VRDays)

2. Euro VR_1 conference:
“My motivation for joining EuroXR was the opportunity to initiate collaboration in areas such as virtual reality, geometric computing, medical simulation, digital health, VR for robotics, and visual computing. I was interested in contributing to common EU proposals and helping to shape the EuroXR conference”.

   Submission  
 Authors must use the LaTeX class files eurocg23  and eurocg23-submission  , which are based on the LIPICS class file. These class files should automatically count all lines containing text, excluding title and references, and excluding figures. Authors are expected to make reasonable effort to make sure all lines that contain text are counted: the class file should be considered an aid, and the responsibility of correctly counting lines remains with the authors. A zip file containing an example of how to use the class file can be found here  .  
  Acceptance policy  
 EuroCG is a non-competitive forum. We will accept all submissions which are original, correct, well-presented, non-trivial, and in scope. The program committee judges submissions on these five criteria, each of which can lead to rejection. If a submission satisfies all criteria, then it will be accepted: there is no competition against other submissions.  
 Originality: If a submission does not contain original research by the authors, or if there is good reason to believe this is the case, this is a reason for rejection. We do not accept submissions which have already been accepted for publication elsewhere. However, we do explicitly allow submissions that are under review at another conference or journal (at the time of submission to EuroCG). 
  Correctness. If the main / a major result of a submission is not correct, this is a reason for rejection. If an attentive reviewer cannot establish correctness of the results from the content of the submission, this is a reason for rejection. However, an acceptance at EuroCG is no correctness guarantee. 
  Presentation. If a submission is written in a way that makes it unreadable, or it does not follow the submission guidelines as listed in the call for contributions, this is a reason for rejection. 
  Technical Depth. If a submission is trivial, this is a reason for rejection. However, there is no “minimum level” of technical depth required. 
  Scope. If a submission is out of scope, this is a reason for rejection. However, we wish to be inclusive in our interpretation of scope, which includes but is not limited to the list of topics in the call for contributions. 
   Proceedings  
 EuroCG does not have formally reviewed proceedings. A booklet of abstracts, without ISBN, will be accessible online on the website for the benefit of the community and must be regarded as a collection of preprints rather than a formally reviewed selection of papers. Results presented at EuroCG are expected to appear in other conferences with formal proceedings and/or in journals. In particular, papers that have been submitted to other formally reviewed conferences are eligible for presentation at EuroCG, assuming they have not been presented at a conference or published in a journal by the time of the conference. Authors of selected papers will be invited to submit extended versions to a special issue of the Computing in Geometry and Topology (CGT)  journal.  
  Authors of accepted submissions are expected to present their work at the conference (in-person). Failure to do so may result in removal of the contribution from the abstract booklet and conference website.  
 There will also be a voting for the Best Student Presentation.
