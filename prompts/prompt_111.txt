 International Health Informatics III Conference Toward Smart Healthcare in the Digital Transformation Age  
 The International Health Informatics III Conference (HEALTHINFO III)  , centered around the theme “ Towards Smart Healthcare in the Digital Transformation Age   “, is held at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology – VNUHCM from 11 th  and 12 th  October, 2023. This conference builds upon the achievements of the previous HEALTHINFO I and II Conferences, which have successfully addressed a range of topics that have subsequently influenced the international medical industry.  
   HEALTHINFO III is organised in collaboration with the Vietnam Health Economics Association (VHEA), Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology – VNUHCM, School of Medicine – VNUHCM, Pham Ngoc Thach University of Medicine, and Asian Health Literacy Association (AHLA).  
 Domestic and international experts from the Ministry of Health, Department of Health, hospitals, and universities (Taiwan, Singapore, France, England, and Belgium), gathered as to highlight the conference’s commitment to promoting advancements and incorporating innovative solutions in the field of health informatics.  
   “The Conference Organising Committee’s vision for HEALTHINFO III is to create an inclusive and open forum where attendees can engage in discussions, exchange knowledge and experiences, and delve into pressing issues and updates related to the advancement of the health system in the Digital Transformation Age…”.  
 Specialist Level II MD. Nguyen The Dung, Vice President of the Vietnam Health Economics Association (VHEA), has emphasised the significance of HEALTHINFO III.    
 The primary focus of HEALTHINFO III is to explore the construction of a smart health system within the context of digital transformation. The global health system’s deficiencies have been exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this crisis has also accelerated significant advancements in scientific research and digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence. The conference aims to address these issues and seek innovative solutions for building resilient and intelligent healthcare systems.  
 During the afternoon session of October 11 at HEALTHINFO III, several important topics and presentation contents were covered, including:  
 Smart public health strategies, regional development of the enterovirus vaccination | : | Prof. Lin Tzou-yien | – Taipei Medical University, Taiwan, China. 
  Vietnam healthcare digital transformation | : | Assoc. Prof. Md. Luong Ngoc Khue | , Director of Department of Medical service administration (Ministry of Health) 
  Smart health care and development of health literacy for all | : | Prof Peter Chang | – TVMB; Show Chwan Healthcare System; AHLA 
  Conditions for digital transformation of HCMC healthcare | : | Assoc. Prof. PhD. MD. Tang Chi Thuong | , Director of Health Department of HCMC

 ABOUT IPDPS WORKSHOPS   
 Usually held on the first and last day of the conference, IPDPS workshops provide an extended forum that allows the IPDPS community an opportunity to fully explore special topics and to present work that is more preliminary and cutting-edge or that has more practical content than the more mature research presented in the main symposium. Each workshop has its own requirements and schedule for submissions. Workshop paper submission dates typically fall after the notification date for the main symposium papers. Proceedings of the workshops are distributed at the conference and are submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library after the conference.

 ABOUT IPDPS WORKSHOPS   
 Usually held on the first and last day of the conference, IPDPS workshops provide an extended forum that allows the IPDPS community an opportunity to fully explore special topics and to present work that is more preliminary and cutting-edge or that has more practical content than the more mature research presented in the main symposium. Each workshop has its own requirements and schedule for submissions. Workshop paper submission dates typically fall after the notification date for the main symposium papers. Proceedings of the workshops are distributed at the conference and are submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library after the conference.  
 Below is the list of 21 workshops planned for 2023 in St. Petersburg, Florida. For the most up to date information on each workshop, follow the link from this page.
