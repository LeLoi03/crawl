 Submission deadline extended to 30 March  
 Summary:  Thursday, 30 March deadline; 2 page extended abstract, using the "sigconf" style; submission link https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d23    
 To encourage even more submissions we have decided to extend the deadline by one week.  
  Please help spread the word to your colleagues and collaborators.  
  We've additionally moved the poster notification deadline ahead to April 3, to enable accepted poster submitters to benefit from the Early Bird registration rates.

  Physics-based animation 
  Virtual and augmented reality 
  Deep learning for graphics and simulation 
  Collision detection 
  Real-time computer vision 
  Navigation in virtual environments 
  Texture synthesis 
  Real-time post-processing effects 
  Interactive 3D modeling 
  In-the-wild 3D reconstruction 
  Level-of-detail approaches 
  Pre-computed lighting for real-time applications 
  Visibility computation 
  Real-time surface shading 
  Fast shadows, caustics and reflections 
  Impostors and image-based techniques 
  Motion synthesis and path planning 
  Character and crowd animation and simulation techniques 
  Interaction devices and techniques 
  User studies of interactive techniques 
  Sketch-based 3D modeling and design 
  Video game techniques 
  Content generation techniques for real-time applications 
  We encourage submission of work-in-progress, demos, and works published at another venue that are relevant to the I3D community. Accepted posters will be displayed at the conference. In-person attendance of at least one author is expected.  
 Submission Information  
 Poster submissions should be in ACM conference format  using the "sigconf" style. They should include author information and must not be longer than two pages. Submissions shall be sent for review electronically at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d23  . They will be reviewed in a single-blind process. After the posters are accepted in the conference, they will appear in an online database for distribution at their authors' discretion. Accepted poster authors are expected to provide a brief teaser video (30 seconds), to participate in an in-person fast-forward session at the conference and to bring a physical copy of the poster to the conference. The conference will also include a poster session, with a Q&A opportunity with the post authors.  
 Posters will NOT appear in the I3D proceedings, nor in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Questions regarding the submission process should be emailed to posters@i3dsymposium.org  .  
 Awards  
 The best poster presentation done by a student will be awarded. Information about prize will be available later.

 Summary:  21 of December 2022 deadline; 16 pages + references; anonymous submission; submission link https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d23    
 The ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics and Games (I3D) is the leading conference for real-time 3D computer graphics and human interaction. The symposium brings together researchers, engineers, and industry professionals to discuss their latest work on real-time and interactive computer graphics and related applications. The symposium has a long legacy of innovative and excellent technical content, with influential work on rendering, texture synthesis, collision detection, VR interaction, animation, and many other areas of real-time computer graphics having been presented at the conference.  
 We invite you to submit papers  about real-time 3D graphics, interaction, and games. Topics include, but are not limited to:  
 Real-time rendering 
  Real-time ray tracing and path tracing 
  Physics-based animation 
  Virtual and augmented reality 
  Deep learning for graphics and simulation 
  Collision detection 
  Real-time computer vision 
  Navigation in virtual environments 
  Texture synthesis 
  Real-time post-processing effects

  Character and crowd animation and simulation techniques 
  Interaction devices and techniques 
  User studies of interactive techniques 
  Sketch-based 3D modeling and design 
  Video game techniques 
  Content generation techniques for real-time applications 
  Submission Information  
 Research papers should be in ACM conference format  using the ACM small trim journal size (“acmsmall”). They should contain at most sixteen (16) pages of content, including appendices but excluding references. The bibliography/reference listing at the end and optional supplemental material do not count towards this limit. Videos are required for techniques involving motion or animation.  
 There is a single track for paper submission and authors will be asked to present a 15-20 minute talk on each accepted paper at the conference. Remote presentations will be made possible on an as needed basis. At least one (1) author from each accepted paper must register for the conference. Authors of accepted papers will be invited to also present their work during the posters session to give their co-authors an opportunity to present.  
 Papers must be submitted anonymously and will be evaluated by double-blind peer review from an international program committee of published authors and tertiary reviewers. There is no rebuttal process. The submission system link is https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d23   
 All accepted papers will be published in a special issue of the Proceedings of the ACM in Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques (PACM CGIT)  , once all mandatory changes have been addressed and a second round of peer review by the primary reviewer is passed. Accepted paper authors are required to have ORCID identifiers for the camera-ready version.
