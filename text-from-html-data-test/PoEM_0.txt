 Conference Scope  
 PoEM 2023 invites you to contribute by submitting paper(s) on topics related to Enterprise modeling. This year, the theme of the conference is Enterprise Modeling in the Circular Economy. The theme reflects the importance of enterprise modeling methods, techniques and tools to enable enterprises to move to more circular business and operating models.  
 The field of Enterprise Modeling should seek to support these challenges by providing methods and tools, as well as investigating and reporting on the current state-of-research and state-of-practice.
