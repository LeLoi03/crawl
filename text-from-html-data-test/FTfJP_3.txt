 From: Aaron Tomb <aarontomb@gmail.com> Date: Wed, 26 Apr 2023 08:27:38 -0700 To: Aaron Tomb <aarontomb@gmail.com> Subject: [Concurrency] Call for Papers -- Formal Techniques for Java-Like Programs 2023 ========================================================== CALL FOR PAPERS FTfJP 2023 25th Workshop on Formal Techniques for Java-like Programs July 18th, 2023, Seattle, WA, USA https://2023.ecoop.org/track/ftfjp-2023  =========================================================== === Important Dates === * Paper submission: May 22nd, 2023 (AoE) * Author notification: June 23rd, 2023 (AoE) * Workshop date: July 18th, 2023 (co-located with ECOOP 2023) Deadlines expire at 23:59 anywhere on earth on the dates displayed above. Submission site: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ftfjp2023  === Objectives and Scope === Formal techniques can help analyse programs, precisely describe program behaviour, and verify program properties. Modern programming languages are interesting targets for formal techniques due to their ubiquity and wide user base, stable and well-defined interfaces and platforms, and powerful (but also complex) libraries. New languages and applications in this space are continually arising, resulting in new programming languages (PL) research challenges. Work on formal techniques and tools and on the formal underpinnings of programming languages themselves naturally complement each other. FTfJP is an established workshop which has run annually since 1999 alongside ECOOP, with the goal of bringing together people working in both fields. The workshop has a broad PL theme. The most important criterion is that submissions will generate interesting discussions within this community. The term "Java-like" is somewhat historic and should be interpreted broadly: FTfJP solicits and welcomes submissions relating to programming languages in general, beyond Java, including submissions related to C#, Scala, and similar languages, and submissions on more general topics that may be relevant to such languages. Example topics of interest include: * Language design and semantics * Type systems * Concurrency and new application domains * Specification and verification of program properties * Program analysis (static or dynamic) * Program synthesis * Security * Pearls (programs or proofs) FTfJP welcomes submissions on technical contributions, case studies experience reports, challenge proposals, and position papers. Webpages for previous workshops in this series are available at: https://ftfjp.github.io/  === Paper Categories === Contributions are sought in two categories: * Full Papers (6 pages, excluding references) present a technical contribution, case study, or detailed experience report. We welcome both complete and incomplete technical results; ongoing work is particularly welcome, provided it is substantial enough to stimulate interesting discussions. * Short Papers (2 pages, excluding references) should advocate a promising research direction, or otherwise present a position likely to stimulate discussion at the workshop. We encourage, e.g., established researchers to set out a personal vision, and beginning researchers to present a planned path to a Ph.D. Both types of contributions will benefit from feedback received at the workshop. Submissions will be peer reviewed, and will be evaluated based on their clarity and their potential to generate interesting discussions. Reviewing will be single blind, there is no need to anonymize submissions. The format of the workshop encourages interaction. FTfJP is a forum in which a wide range of people share their expertise, from experienced researchers to beginning PhD students. === Submission Guidelines === All submissions and reviews will be managed within EasyChair. Submissions should be made via https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ftfjp2023  There is no need to indicate the paper category (long/short). Submissions should be in acmart/sigplan style, 10pt font. Formatting requirements are detailed on the SIGPLAN Author Information page ( https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/  ). We plan that, as in previous years, accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library, though authors will be able to opt out of this publication, if desired. At least one author of an accepted paper must register to the conference by the early registration date and attend the workshop to present the work and participate in the discussions. Selected papers will also be considered for extended versions to be submitted to the Journal of Object Technology (JOT).     To the Ada-Belgium home page.
