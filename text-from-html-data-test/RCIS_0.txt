 Scope and Topics   
 In the age of connectivity, we experience technological components functioning and communicating in new, expanded ways. Large and interconnected information and communication systems create, aggregate, analyze, communicate, transform and generally process data from various sources to serve a range of applications, services and systems. This spectrum of connectivity enables new opportunities, challenges, issues and risks, which call for investigation and consideration by practitioners, researchers, and other stakeholders. RCIS 2023 will welcome scientists, researchers, engineers and practitioners from a wide range of information science fields and will bring them together to provide opportunities for knowledge sharing and dissemination towards connected information systems and services. Hence, this year, RCIS 2023 has chosen the theme Information Science and the Connected World to be in the center of its reflections and discussions.  
 RCIS welcomes submissions from the whole spectrum of the information science field. The list of themes and topics includes, but is not limited to:  

 A1. Information Systems and their Engineering | A2. User-Oriented Approaches 
 A3. Data and Information Management | A4. Business Process Management 
 A5. Domain-specific IS Engineering | A6. Data Science 
 A7. Information Infrastructures | A8. Reflective Research and Practice 

 Special Journal Issue   
  
 Domain Knowledge Engineering  
  DKE | A selection of the best accepted papers of RCIS 2023, chosen by a dedicated committee, will be invited to submit an extended version of the RCIS paper to the Data & Knowledge Engineering (DKE) journal published by Elsevier ( https://www.journals.elsevier.com/data-and-knowledge-engineering  ). The selection of the papers to invite will be based on the review scores and arguments and the potential for extension.
