  Introduction  
 The 36 th  Annual British Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Conference was held at the University of York in August 2023. The first British HCI Conference was held at the University of East Anglia in 1985, but the second Conference, in 1986, was held at the University of York and the Conference came again to York in 1992. In 1990 when the Conference was held in Cambridge and 1999 when the Conference was held in Edinburgh, it was incorporated in the IFIP INTERACT Conferences on HCI. So British HCI returned to York for the third time and for the third time it was linked to the INTERACT Conference, although this time, the two conferences were separate, with the British HCI Conference on the 29 th  and 29 th  August, and the INTERACT 2023 Conference on the 30 th  August to 1 st  September. Many delegates were able to attend both events, with a discount offered on joint registration.  
 The British HCI Conference again attracted papers on a wide and interesting range of topics in HCI from ones of long standing importance in the field, such as evaluating interfaces (for example, the paper by Theodor Fahlén, Taufik Akbar Sitompul and Rikard Lindell on Evaluating Graphical User Interfaces for Handling Latency in Remote Crane Operation  ) to topics which have only recently come to the fore (for example the paper by Freya Smith, Malak Sadek and Céline Mougenot on Empowering End-users in Co-Designing AI  ). In addition, although this is the British HCI Conference, it also brought together papers from a range of other countries including China, Iceland, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA.
