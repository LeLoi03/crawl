 LIMITS AND MARGINS OF GAMES  

 welcome  
  to digra  
  seville 2023  

 The 2023 DiGRA International Conference  is an initiative of the Digital Games Research Association  , an academic organisation formally established in 2003 in Finland.  

 This new edition will take place on 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 June 2023 in Seville, Spain  , under the theme Limits and Margins of Games  .  

 The organizing committee of the DiGRA 2023 conference is particularly interested in exploring the limits and margins of games.  
 The video game taxon seems insufficient today to describe the theoretical and practical nature linked to this means of expression.  
 The negotiation of limits and margins, and their evaluation over time, constitutes the necessary re-centering operation that modern game studies have been developing since their birth in the late 1990s.  
 However, everything suggests that at this moment we stand at a crossroads: the entering of VR as a significant agent, the exponential growth of independent proposals, the strengthening of digital industries as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemicâ€¦ are facts that impact on the old general agreements about the medium, significantly altering its theoretical roadmap.  
 As a result of these concerns, and with the aim of building an international framework for a dialogue about them, we proposed the Limits and Margins of Games as the central theme to this yearâ€™s edition.  
 We hope to be able to offer you an experience on a par with previous editions and a unique meeting point in the south of Europe.  
 Welcome to DiGRA 2023!
