 Summary :  This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Inductive Logic Programming, ILP 2023, held in Bari, Italy, during November 13⁰́₃15, 2023. The 11 full papers and 1 short paper included in this book were carefully reviewed and selected from 18 submissions. They cover all aspects of learning in logic, multi-relational data mining, statistical relational learning, graph and tree mining, learning in other (non-propositional) logic-based knowledge representation frameworks, exploring intersections to statistical learning and other probabilistic approaches
