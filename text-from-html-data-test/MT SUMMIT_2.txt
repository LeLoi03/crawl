  Workshops  
 WAT 2023  
 The Workshop on Asian Translation (WAT) is an open machine translation evaluation campaign focusing on Asian languages. WAT gathers and shares the resources and knowledge of Asian language translation to understand the problems to be solved for the practical use of machine translation technologies among all Asian countries.  
  WAT 2023   
  
 ALT 2023：Ancient Language Translation Workshop  
 This workshop aims to provide an opportunity for practitioners and scholars of interest to learn about the challenges and latest developments in the field of machine translation for ancient languages. Participants will engage in discussions and hands-on activities to develop a deeper understanding of the field and the techniques used to address the unique challenges posed by translating texts written in ancient languages.

    Call for workshops and tutorials  
 Workshops and tutorials will take place on 4 September and 5 September, 2023.  
 Chairs:  Thepchai Supnithi, Jiajun Zhang [email protected]  [email protected]   
    Workshops  
 We welcome not only proposals on deeply technical research and development topics but also on, for instance, the collection and curation of training data, best practices in training MT systems, human/computer interaction among translators, interpreters, and other users of MT output, and the evolving role of translation automation in the commercial translation production pipeline. Topics about machine translation on Asian languages are especially welcome.  
  
    Tutorials  
 Tutorials are a forum for experts in MT and MT-related areas to deliver concentrated training on a topic of interest in half-day teaching sessions.
