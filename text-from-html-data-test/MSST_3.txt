  International Conference on Massive Storage Systems and Technology (MSST)  
   Back to list   
   
 Library Release Date:   
 Friday, April 14, 2023    

 Abstract:   
 The 37th MSST storage conference will be held the week of May 22, 2023 at Santa Clara University. As an initial resumption of the traditional in-person conference, MSST 2023 will hold three days of events, including five tutorials on Monday May 22 about file systems, storage, and metadata. The Invited Track runs on Tuesday May 23 and Wednesday May 24. Several panels are planned and breaks are provided to encourage the hallway conversations which have also been a proud part of the MSST tradition. There is a mix of talks, ranging from production systems to highly speculative research, and a few broader perspective type analyses.
