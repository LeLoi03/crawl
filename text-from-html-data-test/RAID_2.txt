 Overview  
 Top Research Topics at Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection?  
 Computer security (40.44%) 
  Intrusion detection system (31.07%) 
  Malware (13.97%) 
  The aim of Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection is to expand the discussion of research in Computer security, Intrusion detection system, Malware, Data mining and Anomaly detection. The research on Computer security featured in the event combines topics in other fields like Software, The Internet, Host (network) and Internet privacy. Intrusion detection system research featured in Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection incorporates concerns from various other topics such as Computer network, Real-time computing and Embedded system.  
 The works on Computer network deal in particular with Network packet. The presentations focused mostly on Malware in an attempt to further explore topics in Operating system. The study on Data mining presented is investigated in conjunction with research in Set (abstract data type).  
 Artificial intelligence research discussed connects with the study of Pattern recognition.  
 What are the most cited papers published at the conference?  
 Anomalous Payload-Based Network Intrusion Detection (802 citations) 
  Probabilistic Alert Correlation (738 citations) 
  The 1999 DARPA off-line intrusion detection evaluation (715 citations) 
  Research areas of the most cited articles at Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection:  
 The published papers primarily tackle Intrusion detection system, Computer security, Data mining, Malware and Anomaly detection. While work presented in the most cited articles provide substantial information on Intrusion detection system, it also covers topics in Real-time computing, Network security and Network packet. The Exploit studies presented in the conference articles fall under the field of Computer security, but they also have connections to other fields such as Context (language use).  
 What topics the last edition of the conference is best known for?  
 Operating system 
  The Internet 
  Computer network 
  The previous edition focused in particular on these issues:  
 The scientific interests tackled in Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection are Computer security, Cloud computing, Operating system, Malware and Android (operating system). While the event primarily focused on Computer security, it also opened dialogues on the discipline of Extortion. Some problems in Cloud computing that were presented in Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection overlapped with concepts under Virtual device, Distributed computing, Test case and Internet privacy.  
 Many of the research works in Operating system, specifically Hypervisor, Cloud computing security and Plaintext, closely connected to disciplines like Cold boot attack and Secure input and output handling. While it focused on Malware, it was also able to explore topics like Anomaly detection and Root cause. While work presented in Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection provided substantial information on Android (operating system), it also covered topics in Exploit, JavaScript and Implementation.  
 The most cited articles from the last conference are:  
 Redemption: Real-Time Protection Against Ransomware at End-Hosts (55 citations) 
  Mining on Someone Else’s Dime: Mitigating Covert Mining Operations in Clouds and Enterprises (38 citations) 
  CFI CaRE: Hardware-Supported Call and Return Enforcement for Commercial Microcontrollers (28 citations) 
  Papers citation over time  
 A key indicator for each conference is its effectiveness in reaching other researchers with the papers published at that venue.  
 The chart below presents the interquartile range (first quartile 25%, median 50% and third quartile 75%) of the number of citations of articles over time.

 Publication chance based on affiliation  
 The publication chance index shows the ratio of articles published by the best research institutions at the conference edition to all articles published within that conference. The best research institutions were selected based on the largest number of articles published during all editions of the conference.  
 The chart below presents the percentage ratio of articles from top institutions (based on their ranking of total papers).Top affiliations were grouped by their rank into the following tiers: top 1-10, top 11-20, top 21-50, and top 51+. Only articles with a recognized affiliation are considered.  

 Research.com  

 During the most recent 2017 edition, 4.76%  of publications had an unrecognized affiliation. Out of the publications with recognized affiliations, 30.00%  were posted by at least one author from the top 10 institutions publishing at the conference. Another 15.00%  included authors affiliated with research institutions from the top 11-20 affiliations. Institutions from the 21-50 range included 30.00%  of all publications and 25.00%  were from other institutions.  
 Returning Authors Index  
 A very common phenomenon observed among researchers publishing scientific articles is the intentional selection of conferences they have already attended in the past. In particular, it is worth analyzing the case when the authors participate in the same conference from year to year.  
 The Returning Authors Index presented below illustrates the ratio of authors who participated in both a given as well as the previous edition of the conference in relation to all participants in a given year.

 Returning Institution Index  
 The graph below shows the Returning Institution Index, illustrating the ratio of institutions that participated in both a given and the previous edition of the conference in relation to all affiliations present in a given year.

 The experience to innovation index  
 Our experience to innovation index was created to show a cross-section of the experience level of authors publishing at a conference. The index includes the authors publishing at the last edition of a conference  , grouped by total number of publications throughout their academic career (P) and the total number of citations of these publications ever received (C).  
 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups:  
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25), 
  Competent - P < 10 or C < 100 (the number of publications less than 10 or the number of citations less than 100), 
  Experienced - P < 25 or C < 625 (the number of publications less than 25 or the number of citations less than 625), 
  Master - P < 50 or C < 2500 (the number of publications less than 50 or the number of citations less than 2500), 
  Star - P ≥ 50 and C ≥ 2500 (both the number of publications greater than 50 and the number of citations greater than 2500). 

 The chart below illustrates experience levels of first authors in cases of publications with multiple authors.
