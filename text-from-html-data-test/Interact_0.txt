  The Train Strikes  
  
  27-August-2023  
  
  To find out whether your train is cancelled or not, you must look at the website of the company actually running your train (the companies share normal timetables, but they are not sharing the strike information.  
   
  The company should be on your ticket, but if you are not sure ask one of the local organisers for help.  
   
  The companies that you are most likely to have (and the relevant pages on their websites to check) are:  

  LNER (trains to London and Edinburgh)   
   
  Grand Central (trains to London)   
  Not many trains and more affected by engineering work than the strikes   

  TransPennine Express (Trains to Manchester Airport)   
   
  Northern (Trains to Manchester Airport)   

 ABOUT THIS EVENT  
 INTERACT 2023 is the 19th International Conference of Technical Committee 13 (Human- Computer Interaction)   of IFIP (International Federation for Information Processing)   .  
   
  The INTERACT Conference is held every two years. It started in 1984   , making it one of the longest running conferences on human-computer interaction.  
   
  The INTERACT 2023 Conference will be both in-person and online.  
   
  The Conference will be colocated with the British Computer Society HCI 2023 Conference.  
   
  Visit the BCS HCI Conference page >    
 Theme  
 The theme of the 19th conference is “Design for Equality and Justice”  . Increasingly computer science as a discipline is becoming concerned about issues of justice and equality – from fake news to rights for robots, from the ethics of driverless vehicles to the gamergate controversy.  
   
  The HCI community is surely well placed to be at the leading edge of such discussions within the wider computer science community and in the dialogue between computer science and the broader society.  
   
  Justice and equality are both particularly important concepts both for the City of York and the University of York. The City of York, has a long history of working for justice and equality.  
 Location: York  
 York has a long history of working for justice and equality from the Quakers and their philanthropiic chocolate companies, to current initiatives:  
    
 York continues to work for justice and equality to this day. It is the UK’s first Human Rights City   , encouraging organizations and citizens to “increasingly think about human rights, talk about human rights issues and stand up for rights whether that’s at work, school or home”.  

 The City of York has also launched “One Planet York”   , a network of organisations working towards a more sustainable, resilient and collaborative “one planet” future.  

 York is now working to become the first “Zero emissions” city centre, with much of the medieval centre already car free.
