   The 34th International Workshop on Principles of Diagnosis (DX'23) will be held at the Redwood Glen Camp and Convention Center  , 1430 Wurr Road, Loma Mar, CA, USA, where the Siden Conference Center will be available to us. When registering for DX'23, you will be able to book a full package that includes registration, lodging, and meals.  
 Redwood Glen is a retreat site in the Santa Cruz mountains. There is no public transportation to Redwood Glen or anyplace nearby. One of the chairs will be at Redwood Glen from 2PM onwards on Monday. When you arrive, do not go to the front desk, but drive to the Siden conference center right away and one of us will hand you your room key. Please be aware that there are two Redwood Glen's in the Santa Cruz mountains far apart and make sure to go to the one on Wurr road.  
 Your transportation options are as follows:  
 Renting a car is the simplest way to reach the venue. Please make sure you use a navigation device or app, since paper maps are out of date. A number of roads have been washed out recently, so please consider also the instructions available from the | Redwood Glen website | and bringing a copy of their | pdf instructions | . Redwood Glen suggests to use the address 1430 Wurr Road, Loma Mar, CA 94021 when using your navigation device. 
  Most Uber/Lyft drivers will take you there. Some will reject you because they are unlikely to get a return ride nearby, so you'll get rejected a couple of times. Costs vary by the time of the day and will be in the range of $75-$100 from San Francisco airport. The trip will take an hour+ (depeding on the route). 
  We will collect arrival times and try to coordinate rides for people who need them. So we will be asking people to let us know who can help and who needs help. 
  Worst case, we will arrange for someone to pick you up. Johan will distribute his cell phone number so that you will be able to contact him. Please note that cellphone coverage is spotty in the mountains, so please leave a voicemail and he will check periodically. 
  Very worst case, make your way to Johan's place (the address will be distributed). Someone will be there. Please note that Uber/Lyft will always work there. It is much closer to Redwood Glen. 
  Returning to the airport is even more difficult because Uber/Lyft typically won't come to the mountains for a pickup. Hopefully there will be enough people with cars.
