 Effective risk assessment methodologies are the cornerstone of a successful Critical Infrastructure Protection program. The extensive number of risk assessment methodologies for critical infrastructures clearly supports this argument. Risk assessment is indispensable in order to identify threats, assess vulnerabilities and evaluate the impact on assets, infrastructures or systems taking into account the probability of the occurrence of these threats. This is a critical element that differentiates a risk assessment from a typical impact assessment methodology

 This report proposes a set of science-for-policy future directions for AI and child’s rights. It connects research and policy to gain insights by the interplay among different stakeholders and to go beyond the identification of ethical guidelines towards methods for practical future implementations. For the formulation of the proposed directions, we considered the current relevant policy initiatives by major international organizations and the recent coordinated actions on AI by the European Commission as well as the state-of-the art of the scientific work on AI-based technologies for children with a focus on three applications, conversational agents, recommender systems and robotic systems. In addition, we took into consideration the results of two workshops with young people and three workshops with experts and policymakers that contributed to the formulation of a set of requirements, methods and knowledge gaps as an integrated agenda for research and policy on AI and the rights of the child.

 Deceptive directories and "vulnerable" logs: a honeypot study of the LDAP and log4j attack landscape

 The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) has been widely used to query directory services. It is mainly utilized for reading, writing, and searching directory services like the Active Directory. The vast adoption of LDAP for authentication has entailed several attack attempts like injection attacks and unauthorized access due to third-party key storage. Furthermore, recent vulnerabilities discovered in libraries like the Log4j can lead adversaries to obtain unauthorized information from the directory services through pivoting attacks. Moreover, the LDAP can be configured to operate on UDP, motivating adversaries to exploit it for Distributed Reflection Denial of Service attacks (DRDoS). This paper presents a study of attacks on the LDAP by deploying honeypots that simulate multiple profiles that support the LDAP service and correlating the attack datasets obtained from honeypots deployed by the Honeynet Project community. We observe a total of 39, 388 malicious events targeting the honeypots and discover 273 unique attack sources performing pivot attacks in a period of one month.

 Sustainability Budgets: A Practical Management and Governance Method for Achieving Goal 13 of the Sustainable Development Goals for AI Development

 Climate change is a global priority. In 2015, the United Nations (UN) outlined its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which stated that taking urgent action to tackle climate change and its impacts was a key priority. The 2021 World Climate Summit finished with calls for governments to take tougher measures towards reducing their carbon footprints. However, it is not obvious how governments can make practical implementations to achieve this goal. One challenge towards achieving a reduced carbon footprint is gaining awareness of how energy exhaustive a system or mechanism is. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used to solve global problems, and its use could potentially solve challenges relating to climate change, but the creation of AI systems often requires vast amounts of, up front, computing power, and, thereby, it can be a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. If governments are to take the SDGs and calls to reduce carbon footprints seriously, they need to find a management and governance mechanism to (i) audit how much their AI system ‘costs’ in terms of energy consumption and (ii) incentivise individuals to act based upon the auditing outcomes, in order to avoid or justify politically controversial restrictions that may be seen as bypassing the creativity of developers. The idea is thus to find a practical solution that can be implemented in software design that incentivises and rewards and that respects the autonomy of developers and designers to come up with smart solutions. This paper proposes such a sustainability management mechanism by introducing the notion of ‘Sustainability Budgets’—akin to Privacy Budgets used in Differential Privacy—and by using these to introduce a ‘Game’ where participants are rewarded for designing systems that are ‘energy efficient’. Participants in this game are, among others, the Machine Learning developers themselves, which is a new focus for this problem that this text introduces. The paper later expands this notion to sustainability management in general and outlines how it might fit into a wider governance framework.

 Purpose Based on communication privacy management (CPM) theory, this study aimed to explore how gender and age criteria, motivational criterion (locatability), benefit-risk ratio criteria (perceived benefits of privacy information disclosure and privacy concerns), contextual criteria (privacy experience) and boundary coordination and turbulence (perceived effectiveness of privacy policy) interact and combine in leading to voice assistant (VA) users' intention to reveal or conceal their privacy information. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire was designed and distributed to car drivers who have intelligent VA use experience while driving. A total of 230 valid responses were collected. The fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) approach was used to analyse the data. Findings Via configuration analysis with fsQCA, five equivalent configurations leading to the high intention of disclosing privacy information, and one configuration leading to the intention of concealing privacy information were identified. Four theoretical configurational propositions were proposed. Moreover, the theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed. Originality/value This study offers some insightful implications in the field of private information communication in artificial intelligence applications as well as practical implications for intelligent VA application design. The findings provide empirical evidence of privacy communication management in the context of smart VA usage.

 D-dimensional developed MHD turbulence: Double expansion model

  Developed magnetohydrodynamic turbulence near two dimensions d   d      up to three dimensions has been investigated by means of renormalization group approach and double expansion regularization. A modification of standard minimal subtraction scheme has been used to analyze the stability of the Kolmogorov scaling regime which is governed by the renormalization group fixed point. The exact analytical ... [Show full abstract]  expressions have been obtained for the fixed points. The continuation of the universal value of the inverse Prandtl number u  =  1.562   u=1.562      determined at d  =  2   d=2      up to d  =  3   d=3      restores the value of u  =  1.393   u=1.393      which is known in the kinetic fixed point from usual ϵ   \epsilon      -expansion. The magnetic stable fixed point has been calculated and its stability region has been also examined. This point losses stability: (1) below critical value of dimension d  c   =  2.36   d_c=2.36      (independently on the a   a      -parameter of a magnetic forcing) and, (2) below the value of a  c   =  0.146   a_c=0.146      (independently on the dimension).
