 The International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management (IC3K)  is to bring together researchers, engineers and practitioners on the areas of Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management.  
 Sponsored by the Institute for Systems and Technologies of Information, Control and Communication (INSTICC) IC3K is composed of three co-located conferences:  
 KDIR – International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Information Retrieval | The primary focus of KDIR is to provide a major forum for the scientific and technical advancement of knowledge discovery and information retrieval. 
  KEOD – International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Ontology Development | KEOD aims at becoming a major meeting point for researchers and practitioners interested in the study and development of methodologies and technologies for Knowledge Engineering and Ontology Development. 
  KMIS – International Conference on Knowledge Management and Information Sharing | KMIS aims at becoming a major meeting point for researchers and practitioners interested in the study and application of all perspectives of Knowledge Management and Information Sharing. 
  Since 2014 IC3K is held in conjunction with the International Joint Conference on Computational Intelligence (IJCCI) and since 2018 in conjunction with IJCCI and some other conferences all organized by INSTICC.
