  24th International Symposium on Fundamentals of Computation Theory, FCT 2023  

 September 18-21, 2023, Trier, Germany  
 News  
 Venue: All talks will be in room C10 on Campus 1, Univ. Trier. Rooms C2, C3 and C4 will be also available for common research during the conference and the subsequent workshop. All the rooms are in the C building (see | Campus 1 map | ). A more detailed conference program is available below. 
  Registration is | now open | . For the authors of accepted papers, we request that at least one author will register with "full registration". Non-full online registrations are for free. Only to fully-registered participants, printed proceedings can be delivered. We will close the registration server on THU, Sept. 14th, 2023. 
  List of accepted papers appears below. 
  Titles of the invited talks have been added below to the speakers. 
  The | submission server | is closed now. We are currently evaluating the submissions. As planned, notifications will be sent out by mid-July. 
  Thanks for submitting original research in Theoretical Computer Science, formatted using LNCS style: at most 14 pages (including references) plus a clearly marked appendix. Firm abstract deadline: May 26th, 2023; full papers must be submitted until June 1st, 2023. The reviewing is single-blind. 
  We plan to have a 1-day informal workshop on “Graph Labelling in Computer Science” (GLiCS) after the conference, on September, 22nd. Details will be fixed soon. 
  Special Issue for the best papers of FCT 2023 approved with the prestigious | Journal of Computer and System Sciences | . 
  Four invited speakers have confirmed their participation, details below. 
  Further algorithmic papers will be invited for another Special Issue with | Algorithms | . 
  Publication of conference proceedings as an | LNCS volume | of the ARCoSS subline approved by Springer. 
  There will be a best paper and a best student paper award sponsored by the publisher Springer. 
  We are grateful for a further special sponsorship of the conference from the publisher MDPI.
