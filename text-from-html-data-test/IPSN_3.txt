 The International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks  (IPSN) is a leading annual forum on research in networked sensing and control, broadly defined. IPSN brings together researchers from academia, industry, and government to present and discuss recent advances in both theoretical and experimental research. Its scope includes signal and image processing, information and coding theory, databases and information management, distributed algorithms, networks and protocols, wireless communications, collaborative objects and the Internet of Things, machine learning, mobile and social sensing, and embedded systems design. Of special interest are contributions at the confluence of multiple of these areas.  
 IPSN'20 is part of CPS-IoT Week 2020  , co-located with conferences HSCC, ICCPS, IoTDI and RTAS.
