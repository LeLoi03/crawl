 Fast Software Encryption (FSE)  
 The Conference on Fast Software Encryption (FSE) has been sponsored by the IACR since 2004. FSE concentrates on fast and secure primitives for symmetric cryptography, including the design and analysis of block ciphers, stream ciphers, encryption schemes, analysis and evaluation tools, hash functions, and MAC algorithms.  
 FSE Steering Committee
