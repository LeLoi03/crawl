   Theme    
 WCAE provides a forum for educators in computer architecture to discuss and share their experiences and teaching philosophy. Past WCAEs have been held in conjunction with HPCA, ISCA, and Micro. Over 220 papers on computer architecture education have been presented at the workshop since its inception in 1995. Participants will come away from the workshop with new ideas on delivering courses in computer architecture. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following.  
 Topics of interest    
  
 Approaches to introductory courses 
  Advanced courses 
  Online resources 
  Resources for "flipped" classes 
  Materials for active learning 
  Lecture vs. hybrid vs. flipped classes 
  Lab support for distance education 
  Textbook development 
  Critical evaluation of textbook approaches 
  Metrics for evaluating learning gains 
  Tools and techniques for autograding non-programming assignments 
  Integration of research into teaching 
  Industrial support for teaching | Resources & techniques for teaching ... | quantum architecture & programming 
  GPU architecture & programming 
  multicore/many-core issues 
  comp. arch. concepts with FPGAs
