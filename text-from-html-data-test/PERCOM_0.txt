 PerCom 2023  
  
 The 21st International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom 2023)   
 March 13-17, 2023 in Atlanta, USA.  

  Conference Overview   
 IEEE PerCom, now in its 21st year, will be held in Atlanta, Georgia (USA), during March 13-17, 2023, as a physical in-person conference. PerCom is the premier annual scholarly venue in pervasive computing and communications. Pervasive computing is constantly at the forefront of mobile systems research, and has found its way into many commercial systems due to tremendous advances in a broad spectrum of technologies and topics such as wireless networking, mobile and distributed computing, sensor systems, ambient intelligence, and smart devices.  
 IEEE Percom 2023 will be held in person. Remote presentations and pre-recorded videos are not allowed unless all authors of an accepted paper are under special circumstances that prevent them from attending the conference in person. Requests for such exceptions will be considered carefully by the organizing committees. We are sympathetic to concerns and sentiments about our in-person focus. We will fully accommodate remote authors/speakers if they have Visa-related travel issues or COVID/health-related travel issues.
