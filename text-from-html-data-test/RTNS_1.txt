 Building a Cyber-Physical Metaverse  
 The Metaverse has first been coined in literature as a virtual world for humans to interact. More recently, this term has been used for a new form of social network, connecting people around the world through Extended Reality (XR). This talk will propose a Metaverse for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), not only enabling interaction of humans with humans, but broadening the concept to include sensors, actuators, and physical machines, represented in the form of interconnected digital twins (DTs). This Cyber-Physical Metaverse (CPM) need not and likely will not be distinct from the Metaverse humans are interacting in. However, the focus is rather on interconnecting devices to enable functionality, including those with real-time and safety requirements, on a scale never seen before. The talk will outline the technical challenges and solutions paving the way towards this vision.  
   
 Dirk Ziegenbein  
 is chief expert for cyber-physical systems engineering and leads a program developing methods and technologies for dynamic distributed systems at Bosch Corporate Research in Stuttgart, Germany. Dirk received a Master’s degree from Virginia Tech and a Ph.D. from Technical University of Braunschweig for his dissertation on modeling and design of embedded systems. He held several positions in R&D (software component technology, scheduling analysis, software architectures for multi-cores, autonomous systems design) and product management (embedded software engineering tools).
