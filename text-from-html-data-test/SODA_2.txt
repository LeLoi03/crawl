 Overview  
 Top Research Topics at Symposium on Discrete Algorithms?  
 Combinatorics (54.68%) 
  Discrete mathematics (43.30%) 
  Algorithm (16.40%) 
  Symposium on Discrete Algorithms investigates areas of study like Combinatorics, Discrete mathematics, Algorithm, Time complexity and Upper and lower bounds. While the conference focused on Combinatorics, it was also able to explore topics like Bounded function, Set (abstract data type) and Constant (mathematics). The conference focuses on Discrete mathematics as well as the interrelated topic of Polynomial.  
 The studies tackled, which mainly focus on Algorithm, apply to Theoretical computer science as well. The Binary logarithm research dealing mostly with Log-log plot is the focus of the event. The event is concerned with the study of Approximation algorithm and Mathematical optimization in general.  
 It facilitates discussions on Mathematical optimization that incorporate concepts from other fields like Scheduling (computing) and Competitive analysis. The conference features Competitive analysis research that overlaps with concepts in Online algorithm. The event connects research in Chordal graph with the related topic of Indifference graph.  
 What are the most cited papers published at the conference?  
 k-means++: the advantages of careful seeding (4841 citations) 
  Authoritative sources in a hyperlinked environment (1412 citations) 
  Data structures and algorithms for nearest neighbor search in general metric spaces (927 citations) 
  Research areas of the most cited articles at Symposium on Discrete Algorithms:  
 The published articles focus on Combinatorics, Discrete mathematics, Algorithm, Mathematical optimization and Approximation algorithm. While work presented in the published papers provide substantial information on Combinatorics, it also covers topics in Upper and lower bounds and Set (abstract data type). The studies on Discrete mathematics discussed at the most cited publications can also contribute to research in the domains of Bounded function, Data structure and Constant (mathematics).  
 What topics the last edition of the conference is best known for?  
 Combinatorics 
  Algorithm 
  Statistics 
  The previous edition focused in particular on these issues:  
 Symposium on Discrete Algorithms facilitates discussions on Combinatorics, Discrete mathematics, Binary logarithm, Time complexity and Algorithm. The concepts on Combinatorics presented in the conference can also apply to other research fields, including Matching (graph theory) and Upper and lower bounds. The tackled Discrete mathematics research is interrelated with Bounded function which concerns subjects like Treewidth.  
 The Binary logarithm works featured in the event incorporate elements from Graph (abstract data type), Deterministic algorithm, Open problem, Space (mathematics) and Data structure. The conference explores research in Graph (abstract data type) and the adjacent study of Omega. The conference explores research in Time complexity and the adjacent study of Class (set theory).  
 The most cited articles from the last conference are:  
 A Refined Laser Method and Faster Matrix Multiplication (63 citations) 
  Rapid Mixing for Colorings via Spectral Independence (18 citations) 
  Improved Deterministic Network Decomposition (18 citations) 
  Papers citation over time  
 A key indicator for each conference is its effectiveness in reaching other researchers with the papers published at that venue.  
 The chart below presents the interquartile range (first quartile 25%, median 50% and third quartile 75%) of the number of citations of articles over time.

 Publication chance based on affiliation  
 The publication chance index shows the ratio of articles published by the best research institutions at the conference edition to all articles published within that conference. The best research institutions were selected based on the largest number of articles published during all editions of the conference.  
 The chart below presents the percentage ratio of articles from top institutions (based on their ranking of total papers).Top affiliations were grouped by their rank into the following tiers: top 1-10, top 11-20, top 21-50, and top 51+. Only articles with a recognized affiliation are considered.  

 Research.com  

 During the most recent 2021 edition, 2.14%  of publications had an unrecognized affiliation. Out of the publications with recognized affiliations, 29.51%  were posted by at least one author from the top 10 institutions publishing at the conference. Another 20.77%  included authors affiliated with research institutions from the top 11-20 affiliations. Institutions from the 21-50 range included 20.77%  of all publications and 28.96%  were from other institutions.  
 Returning Authors Index  
 A very common phenomenon observed among researchers publishing scientific articles is the intentional selection of conferences they have already attended in the past. In particular, it is worth analyzing the case when the authors participate in the same conference from year to year.  
 The Returning Authors Index presented below illustrates the ratio of authors who participated in both a given as well as the previous edition of the conference in relation to all participants in a given year.

 Returning Institution Index  
 The graph below shows the Returning Institution Index, illustrating the ratio of institutions that participated in both a given and the previous edition of the conference in relation to all affiliations present in a given year.

 The experience to innovation index  
 Our experience to innovation index was created to show a cross-section of the experience level of authors publishing at a conference. The index includes the authors publishing at the last edition of a conference  , grouped by total number of publications throughout their academic career (P) and the total number of citations of these publications ever received (C).  
 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups:  
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25), 
  Competent - P < 10 or C < 100 (the number of publications less than 10 or the number of citations less than 100), 
  Experienced - P < 25 or C < 625 (the number of publications less than 25 or the number of citations less than 625), 
  Master - P < 50 or C < 2500 (the number of publications less than 50 or the number of citations less than 2500), 
  Star - P ≥ 50 and C ≥ 2500 (both the number of publications greater than 50 and the number of citations greater than 2500). 

 The chart below illustrates experience levels of first authors in cases of publications with multiple authors.
