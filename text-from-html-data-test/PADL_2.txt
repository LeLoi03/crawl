 26th International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages   
  (PADL 2024)   
 https://popl24.sigplan.org/home/PADL-2024   
 London, United Kingdom, January 15-16, 2024   
 Co-located with ACM POPL 2024   

 Conference Description  
 Declarative languages comprise several well-established classes of formalisms, namely, functional, logic, and constraint programming. Such formalisms enjoy both sound theoretical bases and the availability of attractive frameworks for application development. Indeed, they have been already successfully applied to many different real-world situations, ranging from database management to active networks to software engineering to decision support systems.  
 New developments in theory and implementation fostered applications in new areas. At the same time, applications of declarative languages to novel and challenging problems raise many interesting research issues, including designing for scalability, language extensions for application deployment, and programming environments. Thus, applications drive the progress in the theory and implementation of declarative systems, and benefit from this progress as well.  
 PADL is a well-established forum for researchers and practitioners to present original work emphasizing novel applications and implementation techniques for all forms of declarative programming, including functional and logic programming, database and constraint programming, and theorem proving.  
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Innovative applications of declarative languages 
  Declarative domain-specific languages and applications 
  Practical applications of theoretical results 
  New language developments and their impact on applications 
  Declarative languages and software engineering 
  Evaluation of implementation techniques on practical applications 
  Practical experiences and industrial applications 
  Novel uses of declarative languages in the classroom 
  Practical extensions such as constraint-based, probabilistic, and reactive languages 
  PADL 2024 especially welcomes new ideas and approaches related to applications, design and implementation of declarative languages going beyond the scope of the past PADL symposia, for example, advanced database languages and contract languages, as well as verification and theorem proving methods that rely on declarative languages.  
 Submissions  
 PADL 2024 welcomes three kinds of submission:  
 Technical papers (max. 15 pages): Technical papers must describe original, previously unpublished research results. 
  Application papers (max. 8 pages): | Application papers are a mechanism to present important practical | applications of declarative languages that occur in industry or in | areas of research other than Computer Science. Application papers | are expected to describe complex and/or real-world applications that | rely on an innovative use of declarative languages. Application | descriptions, engineering solutions and real-world experiences (both | positive and negative) are solicited. 
  Extended abstracts (max. 3 pages): | Describing new ideas, a new perspective on already published work, | or work-in-progress that is not yet ready for a full | publication. Extended abstracts will be posted on the symposium | website but will not be published in the formal proceedings. 
  All page limits exclude references. Submissions must be written in English and formatted according to the standard Springer LNCS style, see  
  https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines   
 Page numbers (and, if possible, line numbers) should appear on the manuscript to help the reviewers in writing their reports. So, for LaTeX, we recommend that authors use:  
 \pagestyle{plain}  
  \usepackage{lineno}  
  \linenumbers  
 The conference proceedings of PADL 2024 will be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally published workshops proceedings may be submitted but the authors should notify the program chairs where it has previously appeared. Papers should be submitted electronically at  
  https://padl2024.hotcrp.com   
 Important Dates  
 Paper submission: October 5, 2023 (AoE)  
  Notification: November 9, 2023  
  Symposium: January 15-16, 2024  
 Distinguished Papers  
 The authors of a small number of distinguished papers will be invited to submit a longer version for journal publication after the symposium. For papers related to logic programming, that will be in  
  the journal Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)  
  https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/theory-and-practice-of-logic-programming   
  and for papers related to functional programming, in Journal of Functional Programming (JFP)  
  https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-functional-programming   
  The extended journal submissions should be substantially (roughly 30%) extended: explanations for which there was no space, illuminating examples and proofs, additional definitions and theorems, further experimental results, implementational details and feedback from practical/engineering use, extended discussion of related work, and so on. These submissions will then be subject to the usual peer review process by the journal, although with the aim of a swifter review process by reusing original reviews from PADL.
