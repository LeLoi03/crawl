 Background The International Conference on Mathematics of Program Construction (MPC) aims to promote the development of mathematical principles and techniques that are demonstrably practical and effective in the process of constructing computer programs. MPC 2022 is going to be held as part of the Computational Logic Autumn Summit of 2022 ( CLAS 2022). Previous conferences were held in: – Porto, Portugal (2019); – Königswinter, Germany (2015); – Madrid, Spain (2012); – Québec City, Canada (2010); – Marseille, France (2008); – Kuressaare, Estonia (2006); – Stirling, UK (2004); – Dagstuhl, Germany (2002); – Ponte de Lima, Portugal (2000); – Marstrand, Sweden (1998); – Kloster Irsee, Germany (1995); – Oxford, UK (1992); – Twente, The Netherlands (1989). Scope MPC seeks original papers on mathematical methods and tools put to use in program construction. Topics of interest range from algorithmics to support for program construction in programming languages and systems. Typical areas include type systems, program analysis and transformation, programming language semantics, security, and program logics. The notion of a ‘program’ is interpreted broadly, ranging from algorithms to hardware. Theoretical contributions are welcome, provided that their relevance to program construction is clear. Reports on applications are welcome, provided that their mathematical basis is evident. We also encourage the submission of ‘programming pearls’ that present elegant and instructive examples of the mathematics of program construction.  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2022-04-17
