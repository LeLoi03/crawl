 SETA is the leading international conference in the areas of sequences and their applications to communication and cryptography. It has been held in various locations around the world in Singapore (Republic of Singapore) 1998, Bergen (Norway) 2001, Seoul (South Korea) 2004, Beijing (China) 2006, Lexington (USA) 2008, Paris (France) 2010 and Waterloo (Canada) 2012. The conference provides a forum for the research communities of these domains, and covers all of the fundamental, computational and implementation aspects of these fields. The SETA proceedings will be published by Springer. The eighth International Conference on Sequences and Their Applications (SETA’14) will be held from November 24 to 28, 2014, in Melbourne, Australia. Previously unpublished papers on all technical aspects of sequences and their applications in communications, cryptography, and combinatorics are solicited for submission to SETA’14. Topics include: Randomness of sequences Correlation (periodic and aperiodic types) and combinatorial aspects of sequences (difference sets) Sequences with applications in coding theory and cryptography Sequences over finite fields/rings/function fields Linear and nonlinear feedback shift register sequences Sequences for radar distance ranging, synchronization, identification, and hardware testing Sequences for wireless communication Pseudorandom sequence generators Correlation and transformation of Boolean functions Multidimensional sequences and their correlation properties Linear and nonlinear complexity of sequences  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2016-01-20
