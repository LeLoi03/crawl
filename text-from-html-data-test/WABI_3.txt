 WABI   
  
  Wonderful Algorithms in Bioinformatics   

 The annual WABI conference* brings together researchers from all over the world working on the algorithmic aspects of computational biology for 3 days of contributed papers, invited talks, and poster sessions.   
 WABI was started in 2001 by Bernard Moret and Tandy Warnow at the invitation of Erik Meineche Schmidt, the organizer of the first ALGO meeting. It has been held every year since, in Europe (in conjunction with ALGO) and North America. WABI proceedings are published in established series (  Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science   from 2001 to 2016 and the  Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics   since 2017) and each year a selection of papers are invited for publication in  Algorithms for Molecular Biology   .   
  
  WABI steering committee:  Vincent Moulton (U. East Anglia, UK),  Nadia Pisanti (U. Pisa, Italy), Mona Singh (Princeton U., USA), and  Jens Stoye (Bielefeld U., Germany)  .   
  
  WABI is held in even years in Europe, in conjunction with ALGO, and, since 2015, in odd years in North America, in conjunction with ACM-BCB.   
 WABI 2025 will be held at the University of Maryland, College Park, MA, USA. A web site will be set up soon.

 *WABI started in 2001 as the "Workshop on Algorithms in Bioinformatics", but since it soon developed into a typical conference format, we are now not using the term "Workshop" any more. We believe "Wonderful" is a highly suitable alternative.
