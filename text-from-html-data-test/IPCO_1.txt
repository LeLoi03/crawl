    *Call for Participation*  
 The 24th Conference on Integer Programming and Combinatorial Optimization (IPCO) will take place on June 21–23, 2023 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison (WI), USA. The conference will be preceded by a summer school (June 19-20). IPCO is a forum for researchers and practitioners working on various aspects of integer programming and combinatorial optimization. The aim is to present recent developments in theory, computation, and applications in these areas.  
  The website of IPCO 2023 can be found at https://optimization.discovery.wisc.edu/ipco-2023-madison/

 *Call for Poster Submissions*  
 IPCO 2023 will feature a poster session and a best poster award. The poster session will take place on June 21, 2023.  
 We particularly welcome posters from Ph.D. students and postdocs. Poster abstracts can be submitted at https://forms.gle/vKkv4sq5PaSh1MtZ8.  The abstract format is: a PDF file, one letter-size page maximum, one-inch margins, 11-point font, single-space. The deadline for poster abstract submissions is April 1, 2023.  
 The local committee will select poster presenters, subject to the number of available poster slots. A committee will evaluate posters during the poster session and select the best poster. We anticipate that we might be able to provide some travel support to a limited number of students.  
 The committee will communicate notifications of acceptance by April 15, 2023. Poster presenters are required to register for the conference.  
 Please contact posters-ipco@wid.wisc.edu  if you have any questions.
