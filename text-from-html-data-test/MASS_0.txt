 The 20th IEEE International Conference on   
  Mobile Ad-Hoc and Smart Systems   
  (MASS 2023)   

  September 25 - 27, 2023   
   
  Toronto, Canada   

 ABOUT IEEE MASS 2023  
 IEEE MASS is a premier annual forum for sharing original, novel ideas in mobile ad-hoc networks and smart systems, defined broadly. As wireless ad-hoc networks continue to evolve and specialize into a number of application scenarios and environments, and sensor-based systems and technologies increasingly permeate our everyday life and become the inner fabric of the Internet of Things and cyber-physical systems, the unfolding of smart environments such as smart cities, smart farming, smart healthcare, and smart manufacturing, to name a few, demand integrated solutions that can make intelligent use of both cloud and edge systems, while applying machine learning and artificial intelligence tools to handle their growing complexity and to leverage the vast amount of available data created.  
 Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society and IEEE Computer Society's TCDP, the 20th edition of the IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Smart Systems (MASS) will be held in Toronto, Canada in September 2023, and it aims at bringing together researchers, developers, and practitioners to address recent advances in mobile ad-hoc and smart systems, covering algorithms, theory, protocols, systems & applications, experimental evaluations and testbeds, security/privacy, as well as AI/ML-based smart design.  
 Accepted papers for IEEE MASS 2023 will be included in IEEE Xplore Digital Library after they are presented at the conference. Information and instructions on how to prepare for a presentation will be provided. The organizing committee and the program committee will endeavor to ensure the high quality of the conference program and the excellent experience of conference authors and attendees. Thank you for your understanding and support!
