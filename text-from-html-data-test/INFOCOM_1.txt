 Update: IEEE INFOCOM 2023 to Go Hybrid in the New York Area     
 Due to residual logistic issues associated with the COVID pandemic, INFOCOM 2023 conference site has been moved to the New York area, USA (from Tokyo, Japan) with new meeting dates of May 17-20, 2023. INFOCOM 2023 will be offered in hybrid mode with the in-person conference to be held on the beautiful campus of Stevens Institute of Technology, across the Hudson river from Manhattan, New York City. After holding INFOCOM virtually for three years, we are excited to be able to offer in-person experience of INFOCOM to our attendees in 2023.
