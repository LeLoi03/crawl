  IEEE ISORC  was founded in 1998 (with its first meeting in Kyoto, Japan) to address research into the application of real-time object-oriented distributed technology. Since then, ISORC has continually evolved to meet the latest challenges faced by researchers and practitioners in the real-time domain with an emphasis on object-, component- and service-oriented systems and solutions.  
 ISORC is a single-track conference,  with a lively community. We have hosted a number of associated workshops, and are proud of our spirit of openness. We seek to encourage diverse views and new approaches to all Real-Time Issues and Challenges for novel applications and systems in RT computing issues.  
 Papers are to be submitted through the HotCRP system  .  
 For our 23rd symposium, we are meeting in USA,  in the city of Nashville  , Tennessee from May 23 - 25, 2023  . Our meetings will take place at Vanderbilt University School of Engineering (Featheringill Hall Auditorium room 134).   . For more information on IEEE ISORC 2023 and its location, calls for papers, workshops, and events, please use the menu bar at the top of the screen of the main page. We look forward to seeing you in USA in Nashville 2023!

 Title: Explainable Safety 
 Abstract 
 Safety-critical systems should have their safety properties authoritatively established before they are considered for deployment. If this safety validation is performed via "black-box" methods (e.g., ones based on Deep Learning and related techniques) that are difficult for humans to comprehend, then an accompanying explanation should be provided as to why one may trust that the claim that safety has been validated. But what constitutes an acceptable explanation, and how do we verify the veracity of such explanations? -- these issues will be investigated in this presentation, with a particular focus on the explainability of safety properties relating to timing correctness (i.e., schedulability). 
 Bio: Prof. Sanjoy Baruah 
 Dr. Sanjoy Baruah is Ina Champ Urbauer Professor at the department of Computer Science and Engineering Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA  
  Dr. Sanjoy Baruah (Fellow, IEEE) was with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA, from 1999 to 2017, and The University of Vermont, Burlington, VT, USA from 1993 to 1999. He joined the Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA, in September 2017. His research interests and activities are in real-time and safety-critical system design, scheduling theory resource allocation and sharing in distributed computing environments, and algorithm design and analysis. He is a Fellow of the IEEE, and the recipient of the 2014 Outstanding Technical Contributions and Leadership Award of the IEEE Technical Committee on Real-Time Systems.
