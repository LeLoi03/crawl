 Abstract  
   
 IEEE ICCI*CC'23: Stanford University, August 19-21, 2023. Themes: Fundamental Challenges to Basic Research on the Theories and Methodologies of AI and Cognitive/Intelligent Computing. • What is the next generation of intelligent computers underpinned by discoveries in intelligence science: General cognitive computers vs. pretrained AI systems? [Ref. 1: The Odyssey to Cognitive Computers.] • May the classic preprogrammed (von Neumann) computers deal with infinitive and unpredictable real-world problems at run-time? [Ref. 2: Cognitive Computing and Autonomous AI (AAI).] • Will the pretrained AI systems (such as Chat-GPT) be able to exhaustively cover the entire state space of machine reasoning beyond the coverage of their training models: Enumerational knowledge (empirical) vs. human knowledge (Induction/deduction-based)? [Ref. 3: What can’t Chat-GPT do?] • Will intelligence science enable AI systems to learn human inference mechanisms rather than let them to collect infinitive factors and unstructured knowledge by so called large-language models? How are the essential forms of human intelligence and wisdom generated beyond big data and empirical learning? [Ref. 4: Intelligent Mathematics.]

 [ 17  ],  [18  ],   [19]  is  a  transdisciplinary  field  that  studies  the    
 internal  information  processing  mechanisms  of  the  brain  [ 20 ]   ,    
 [ 21  ],  [  22  ],  the  underlying  abstract  intelligence   (   I)  theories

 Cognitive Computing (CC) [3] ,  [4], [ 15  ],  [ 16  ], [ 27  ], [ 28  ], [ 50  ]  is     
 cutting-edge paradigms of intelligent computing methodologies   
 based  on  CI  ,   which  implements  compu  tational  intelligence  by   
 autonomous  inferences  and  perceptions  mimicking  the   
 mechanisms  of  the  brain.  CI  and  CC  have  led  not  only  to   
 synergize  theories  of  modern  intelligence,  in  formation,   
 computer,  cogniti on  ,  brain,  software,  knowledg  e  sciences  for   
 enabling  AI  ,  cybernetics,  computational  intelligence,  rob  ot ic  s,   
 cognitive  linguistics,  and  neuroinformatics,  but  also  enables   
 novel applications in  cognitive computers  [ 50  ],  [ 65  ], [ 66  ], [ 83 ] ,      
 cognitive robots [ 67  ]  , [ 68   ]  , [ 69  ]  ,   cognitive learning  [70] −  [ 79 ] ,       
 and autonomous  systems  [80]  −  [90],  as well  as the  AI, IT, and   
 software industries.   
 The  IEEE  ICCI*CC series  on  Cognitive  I  nformatics  and   
 Cognitive  Computing  is   the  flagship  conferences  of  its  field   
 sponsored by IEEE CS,  CIS, and SMCS.  Following the past  20    
 successful  conferences  (ICCI’02  through  ICCI*CC’2 1)  [11]  −     
 [ 97 ],  the  21st   IEEE   ICCI*CC’2  2  focuses  on  themes  of     
 Autonomous  AI,  Cognitive  Robots,  Cognitive  Computers,   
 Autonomous  Systems,  Brain-inspired  Systems,  and   
 Autonomous Machine Learning [ 28  ],  [ 40  ], [ 42  ], [ 56  ],  [ 57  ], [ 58  ],   
 [ 71 ], [  93  ],  [  95 ] −   [  99  ],  [  120  ], [  121 ],  [122],  [123], [124],  [125],     
 [ 126 ], [127], [  12  8].     
 A  Hierarchical  Intelligence  Model  (HIM)  [ 26 ]    is     
 introduced  to  describe  the  structure  of  intelligence   scien  ce   
 studied  in CI/CC.  Acco  rding to  HIM,  the  levels  of  human  and   
 AS  intelligence  are  aggreg  ated  from  reflexive,  imperative,    
 adaptive , to autonomous   and  cognitive  intelligence  as shown in    
 Figure  1  .  HIM  explains  that  natural  and  machine  intelligence   
 share the same recursive and hierarchical structure  . In HIM, the   
 higher  the  level  of  intelligent  forms,  the  mor e   complex   and   
 difficult  for  implementation  in  intelligence  science  and   
 computational intelligence  .  HIM indicates that both  human and   
 machine intelligence are formed layer- by  -layer from the bottom   
 up. Witho  ut the  underpinn  ing layers,  the  upper  layers  may  not   
 be implemented.   
 According  to  the  HIM  model,  th  e  higher  layers  of    
 intelligence  science  st ud y  au    tonomous  and  cognitive   
 intelligence,  which  are  explained  by  the  Laye  red  Reference    
 Model  of  the  B  rain  (LRMB)  [ 21 ]    in  Figure  2 .  The  f  our  lower     
 layers  of  LRMB,  such  as those  of  sensation,  action, memory,    
 and percep  tion, are  subconscious  mental function  s of  the brain     
 that are  collectively  classified as  the  Brain ’s  Operating  System     
 (BOS ).   While  the  three  higher  lay  ers  encompassing  those  of     
 cognition,  inference,  and   intelligence  are  classified  as  the    
 Brain ’s  Intelligence Generator (BIG  ) based on BOS.

 LRMB  provides  a brain/co  gnitive  science  foundation  for   
 modeling  Brain-Inspired  Systems   (BIS)  [20].  Based  on  this   
 perspective, any AS is equivalent to a BIS, or vice versa,  which   
 is  essentially  characterized  by  run-time  derived  intelligent   
 behaviors  beyond  those  of  pretrained  or  predetermined  ones   
 [100,  101 ].   LRMB  reveals  that  the  brain  can  be  formally    
 embodied  by  52  cognitive  processes  [ 21  ]  at  seven  recursive   
 layers  from  the bottom   up.  I  n  this  view,  any  complex mental   
 process  or  intelligent  behavior  is  a  temporary  composition  o  f   
 fundamental  processes  of  LRMB  at  run-time.  On  the  basis  of    
 LRMB,  the  nature  of  intelligence  m  ay  b  e  rigo  rously  red  uced   
 onto lower-layer  cognitive objects  such  as data,  information,  and   
 knowledge  in  the f  ollowing  subsections.  According  to  LRMB,   
 the  theoretical  bottleneck  and  technical  challenges  towards    C    
 are  the  lack  of a   fully auto  nomous  intelligent  engine  at  the  top    
 layer  constrained  by  current  pretrained  AI   [101 ]   and   
 preprogramed  computing  technologies  [ 64  ].  Therefore,  fr  om     
 brain  science   point  of  view,  the  next  generation  of  Cognitive    
 Computers (  C)    [4 ]   is a   brain-inspired  intelligent  computer f  or    
 Autonomous In  telligence Generation  (AIG)  underpinned  by an    
 Intelligent Operating System (IOS ) [ 20    ] mimicking the b  rain.     
 This work presents a summary of the plenary panel (Part I)   
 on recent  breakthroughs  in cognitive  informatics  and  cognitive    
 computing towards autonomous AI. Th  e distinguished panelists   
 represent a  group of  the world’s  preeminent s  cholars and  experts   
 in  basic  research  and  industrial  innovations  in  the   
 transdisciplinary  field  of  CI/CC .   The  talks,  discussions,  and   
 interactions  with  audience  show  the  panelists’  visions  and   
 perspectives  on  the  future  development  of  general  AI  and   
 autonomous machine intelligence generation across  the fields of   
 intelligent  science,  computational  intelligence,  general  AI,   
 computer science,  system science,  intelligent math  ematics, and   
 engineering  applications  from  a  wide  spectrum  of  modern   
 industries.  Though,  it  is  noteworthy  that  individ  ual  statements   
 and  opinions  included  in  this  p  anel  summary  may  not   
 necessarily be shared by all panelists.

 Autonomous  systems  (AS)  are  brain-inspired  sy  stems that    
 are  advanced   AI  for  run-time  intelligent  generation  [ 80  ].  The   
 ultimate  goal  of  AS  is  to  enable  Autonomous  AI  ( AAI  )   [ 10  0]   
 that  may  think  and  act  beyond  traditional  pre-trained  and   
 preprogrammed  AI   solutions  [ 64,  100 ]   .    AS  en  able   
 nondeterministic behaviors at run  -time closer to that of h  umans   
 at the level  of cognitive  intelligen ce  . Well  known and  potential   
 paradigms  of  AS  may  encompass  brain-inspired  AI  systems   
 such  as  those  of  deep  machine  learn  ing  systems,  machine   
 consciousness  and  awareness  implementations,  cognitive   
 robots,  self-driving  vehicles,  auton  omous  drones,  real-time   
 machine  inference  engines,  brain-machine  interfaces,  and   
 knowledge-based intelligent systems.   
 A  set  of  fundamental  challenges  to  AS   for  enab  ling   
 Au tonomous  Intelligence  Generation  (AIG )  is    identified  as     
 follows:   
 1)  What  are  the  necessary  and  sufficient  conditions   for   
 enabling AS?   
 2 ) Why had  there rarely  fully function  ing AS   developed in     
 the past 60 years?   
 3)  Does  that  of  Challenge  (2)  indicate  a   theoretical  or    
 technical challenge , or both?

 4)  How  mature  are  o  ur  computing   platforms   for   
 implementing AS, AAI, and AIG ?    
 5)  Is Stored-Program-Controlled  (SPC) computer  s, or von   
 Neumann  machines,  adequate  en  ough  for  designing  and   
 implementing  AS  ,  AAI,  and  AIG?  If  not,  how may  cognitive   
 computers ( κC  )  [4] help?   
 6)  Are our programming languages  sufficiently expressive   
 for implementing AS and  AIG? What  would happen to  AS if  the   
 deterministic conditional  if -then-else   structur  es were exhausted    
 at run-time?   
 7)  Are  our  mathematical  means   ready  for  formally   
 expressing AS? How would  the indeterministic or  unpredictable   
 behaviors  of  AS b  e  formally  d  escribed  in  algorithms  beyond   
 classic programming languages?   
 8)  Are  ty  pical  neural-network-based  regressive  learning    
 systems an AS? Would they merely be  a reflexive system based    
 on pretraining?   
 9)  Is our inference  power adequate for  expressing real-time     
 indeterministic behaviors of AS for AAI  and AIG?   
 10)  How  may  an  AS  be  trusted   when  its  state  space  is   
 infinitive in  de facto  ,  such as  those of self  -driving vehicles  and   
 mission-critical robots?   
 These  fundamental  questions  have  been  centric  in  basic   
 research  on  CI/CC  in  gen  eral,  and  autonomous  systems  /   
 autonomous  AI  /  au  tonomous  intelligence  generation  in   
 particular,  underpinned  by  intelligent  mathematics  .   (  This

 Norbert  Wiener  [102 ]   invented  the  word  cybernetics  and   
 wrote  a  book  by  that  name.  The  subject  was  feedback  and   
 control in the human body.  The new book [5] , “Cybernetics  2.0:    
 a  General  Theory  of  Ad  aptivity  and  Homeostasis  in  the  Brain   
 and in the Body ” follows in Wiener’s  footsteps. It is different as    
 it introd  uces learnin  g algorithms  to  Wiener's  subject.  Learning   
 algorithms did not exist in Wiener’s day.     
 In the  synapse,  information  is  carried  by  neurotransmitte  r    
 which  in  turn  binds  to  neuroreceptors.  The  synapse  is  the   
 coupling  device  from  to  neuron.  The  strength  o  f  the  coupling,   
 the “weigh  t”, is  proportional  to  the  number of  receptors.  Their   
 numbers  can  increase  or  decrease,  as  upregulation  or   
 downregulation. A  mystery in  neuroscience is, wh  at is nature’s    
 algorithm  f  or  controlling  upregulation  and  downregulation?    
 Start  with  Hebbian  learning  and  generalize  it  to  cover   
 downregulation  as  well  as upregu  lation, an  d inhibitory  as  well   
 as ex  citatory  synapses.  What  results  is a  surp  rise!  We h  ave an   
 unsupervised form of the LMS (least mean square) algorithm of   
 Widrow  and  Hoff.  The  Hebbian  -LMS  algorithm  encompasses   
 Hebb’s  learning  rule  (fire  together  ,  wire  together),  and   
 introduces homeostasis  into the  equation.  A  neuron’s  “normal”        
 firing  rate  is  set  by  homeostasis.  Physical   evidence  supports   
 Hebbian- LMS  as  being  nature’  s  learning  rule.  LMS  binds    
 nature’s learning to learning in artificial neural network  s.    
 The same Hebbian-  LMS algorithm is key to  the control  of   
 all  th  e  o  rgans  of  the  body,  where  hormones  bind  to   
 hormonereceptors and there is  upregulation and downregulation   
 in  the  control  process.  (  This  section  is  contributed  by  Prof.

 Over the recent  years, we have  been witnessing spectacular   
 achievements  of  Mach  ine  Learning  with  highly  visible   
 accomplishments encountered, in particular, in nat  ural language   
 processing  an  d  computer  vision  impacting  numerous  areas  of   
 human  endeavours.  Driven  inheren  tly  by  the  technologically   
 advanced  learning  and  architectural  developments,  Machine   
 Learning  constructs  are  highly  impactful  coming  with  far   
 reaching  consequences;  just  to  mention  autonomous  veh  icles,   
 health  care  imaging,  decision  -making  in  critical areas,  among    
 others.   
 We advocate that the design and analysis of ML constructs   
 have  to  be  carried  out  in  a  holistic  man  ner  by  identifying  and   
 addressing  a  series  of  central  and  unavoidable  societal  quests.   
 The  key  challenges  on  the  list  of  interest  concerns   
 interpretability, energy conciseness (being also identified on  the   
 agenda  of  green  AI),  efficient  quantification  of  quality   of  ML   
 constructs,  their  brittleness  and  concep  tual  stability  coming   
 hand  in  hand  with  the  varying  levels  of  abstraction.   These   
 quests are  highly intertwined  and exhibit  relationships  with the   
 technological  end  of  ML.   As  such,  they  deserve  pr  udent   
 attention, in particular when  a multicriterial  facet of the  problem   
 is considered.   
 The  talk  elab  orates  on  the  above  challenges,  offers   
 definitions  an  d  identifies  the  linkages  among  them.  In  the   
 pursuit  of  coping  with  such  challenges,  we  ad  vocate  that   
 Granular  Computing  can  play  a  pivotal  role  offering  a   
 conceptual environment and realizing  algorithmic development.   
 As a detailed  study, we discuss  the ideas of  knowledge transfer   
 showing  how  a   thoughtful  and  prudently  arranged knowledge   
 reuse  to  support  energy-aware  ML  computing.  We  discuss   
 passive and active modes of knowledge transfer.  In both modes,   
 the essential role  of information  granularity is  identified. In the   
 passive approach, information granularity serves a  s a vehicle to   
 quantify  the  credibility  of  the  transferred  knowledge.  In  the   
 active approach, a  new  model is  constructed in  the  target domain   
 whereas  the  design  is  guided  by  the  loss  function,  which   
 involves granular regularization  produced by  the  granular model   
 transferred  from  the  source  domain.  A  generalized  scenario  of   
 multi-source  domains  is  d  iscussed.  Kno  wledge  distillat  ion   
 leading  to  model  compression  is al  so  studied  in  the  context  of   
 transfer  lear  ning.  ( This  section  is  co  ntributed  by  Prof.  Witold

 Symbiotic  autonomous  systems  (SAS)  ar  e  meant  as   
 advanced  intelligent  information  systems  which  involve  a   
 synergistic  cooperation  and  collaboration  between   a  part  of   
 broadly  perceived  autonomous  systems  and   a  cogn  ition  based   
 part, related to the human stakeholder  , and the two parts should   
 operate in a symbiosis [ 80  ]  , [ 81   ].   
 This combination should  guarantee an  added value  in terms   
 of the  effectiveness  and efficiency  of  the systems’  operation  and,   
 above  all,  problem  solving  in  which  a  considerable  part  is   
 related  to  decision  making,  also  profiting  from  some  added   
 values  im  plied  by,  for  instance,  collective  intelligence  and   
 behavior.   
 A  growing  complexity  of  the  world  implies  a  growing   
 complication of decision-making problems, for instance,  related   
 to more  and mo  re stakeholders,  much uncertain,  imprecise  and   
 lacking information,  and an  explicit human  centricity, that  is, a   
 crucial  role  of  the  human  being  in  all  decision  pro  cesses  [ 66 ]   .    
 This all complicated these p  rocesses in particular in  the context   
 of the SAS.   
 We are concerned with an effective and efficient setting, at   
 least now and  the near future,  to run such  decision processes in   
 which the human being is still a decisive stakeholder but h  e/she   
 should  be  aided  or  supported  by  some  additional  “units”,    
 humans  (e.  g.  advisors)  or  “mach  ines”  (e.g.  algorithms  and   
 computer  systems),  where  the  human  being  should  not  be   
 replaced, at least for dealing with sophisticated tasks.    
 We first  consider  the case  when  a  human d  ecision maker,   
 who knows about  the domain  of his  activities  but not necessarily   
 about  solution  tools, is  aided by  a domain  expert who  knows   
 solution tools  but n  ot necessarily  the do  main. We  advocate the   
 use of  the  judge-advisor  type app  roaches. They  are  augmented   
 with  some  AI  (artificial  intelligence)  tools  and  techniques,   
 notably  machine  learning  models  which  can  help fin  d patter  ns   
 and  relationships  in bigger  and  bigger  data  sets. Mo  reover, we   
 deal  with   consistency   of  the  AI  models  employed  with  some   
 inherent  human  characteristics,  the  cognitive  biases,  and  show   
 that  this  is  crucial  for  a  synergistic  collaborative  partnership   
 between  human   beings  and  AI  models/systems,  n  otably   
 operating autonomously.   
 We  also  show  how  such  a  synergistic  cooperation  and   
 collaboration  can  be  implemented   by  employing  a  decision   
 support system  (DSS) to  combine  the power  of the  computer  and   
 the  power  of  the  humans,  notably  using  the  data  or  document   
 driven  DSSs.  This  gives  rise  to  a  so  -called  AI-enabled  DSSs   
 which  employ  advanced  tools  and  techniques  o  f  AI  for  the   
 gathering  and analysis  of  data  and  evidence,  identification  and   
 diagnosis  of  problems,  proposing  courses  of  actions  with  their   
 analyses,  etc.  to  better  “mimic”  human  c  ognitive  capab  ilities,    
 observe  s  ome  inherent  human  characteristic  features,  provide   
 comprehensive and trustworthy procedures  and forms  of results,   
 and –  in general  –  help alleviate limitation o  f a sheer autonomy   
 of  the  system.  ( This  section  is  contributed   by  Prof.  Janusz

 To relieve the  burden  on video  storage, streaming and  other   
 video  services,  researchers  from  the  video  community  have   
 developed a series of v  ideo coding standards. Among  them, the   
 most  up- to  -date  is  the  High  Efficiency  Video  Coding  (HEVC)   
 or H.266  standard, which  has successfully  halved the  coding bits   
 of  its p  redecessor,  H.264/AVC,  without  significant  increase  in   
 perceived  distortion.  With  the  rap  id  growth  of  network   
 transmission  capacity,  enjoying  high  definition  video   
 applications  anytime  and  anywhere  with  mobile  display   
 terminals  will  be  a d  esirable  feature  in  the  near  future.  Due  to   
 the lack  of  hardware  computing  power  and limited  bandwidth  ,   
 lower  co  mplexity  and  higher  compression  efficiency  video   
 coding  scheme  are  still  desired.  For  higher  video  co  mpression   
 performance,  the  key  optimization  problems,  mainly  decision   
 making and resource allocation problem, shall be solved.    
 In the  panel, I  will  discuss the  most recent  research  and new   
 developments  on  deep  neural netwo  rk-based  video  coding  and   
 its  applications  such  as  saliency   detection,  perceptual  visual   
 processing and others.  Optimization techniques  [103], [104]  on   
 the prediction  of integer  DCT  coefficients, intra  mode  prediction   
 have been proposed  to reduce  the complexity of  the video  coder.   
 Machine learning techniques [105], [106]  are further developed   
 for low complexity optimization for HEVC.    
 Recently, much efforts have  been devoted  to promoting the   
 coding performance of video coding with  deep neural networks.   
 By integrating  the neural  network based  modules into  different   
 parts  of  th  e  hybrid  video  coding  framework,  such  as  intra   
 prediction [107], inter prediction [108], and loop  filtering [109],   
 significant  coding  performance  improvement  has  been   
 achieved. This is  very different  from the trad  itional approaches   
 used  in  video  coding.  It  is  h  oped  applying  these  intelligent   
 techniques  to  video  coding  could  go  further  and  have  more   
 choices in trading  off between  costs, complexity and  utilizations   
 of resources. ( This section is contributed by Prof.  Sam Kwong  )

 Despite  impressive  results in  the  last  decade,  learning in   
 engineered  au  tonomous  systems  is  still  application  dependent   
 and  subject  to constrain  ts.  Some  argue  that  real p  rogress  will   
 come  when  human  cognition-inspired  learning  systems  are   
 available.  Their  desiderata,  including  conditional  learning,   
 adaptation,  self-organization,  modularity,  and  sparsity,  ar  e   
 known [ 111 ].     
 With that  in mind,  the long-term  research should  focus on   
 developing  a  unifying,  comprehensive,  principled  learning   
 system  routed   in  signal  processing,  statistics,  and  adaptive   
 systems  principles.  The  presenter  h  as  argued  that challenging   
 problems  can  be  solved  using  a  partitioning  approach  to   
 learning.  Partitioning  -based  learning  decomposes  a  learning   
 task  into  considerably  simpler  tasks,  and  it  then  uses  an   
 inference unit to adapt the simple learners to achieve the o  verall   
 261   

 objective  [ 11  2].  The  partition  between  learning  more   
 manageable conditional tasks  and  updating  an overall  adaptation   
 modu le  is  conceptu  ally  simple,  quite  natural, and  in  line  with    
 views  in  neuroscience  and  human  learning  [ 11  3].  In  principle,   
 partitioning is  a  natural setting  for  studying learning  problems,   
 and  its  flexible  structure  can  produce  learners  meeting   
 computational, communications, and resource-usage constraints   
 in  necessary  application  settings.  The  benefits  o  f  a  unifying   
 learning  theory  are  two-fold.  Firstly,  it  unifies  previous,   
 seemingly unrelated results. Secondly, better i  deas and tractable   
 solutions  can  em  erge.  These  solutions  will  open  t  he  d  oor  for   
 innovative  products  in  k  ey  technology  areas,  su  ch  as  artificial   
 intelligence  (AI)  and  information  communication  technologies   
 (ICT).   
 In  the  short  term,  work  in  this ar  ea  should  commence  on   
 narrow-focused learning a  nd autonomy tasks. A  list of possible   
 activities  in  the  next two-  to  -five  years  may  include  but  is  not   
 limited to:   
 • Learn  to  Estimate   –  i.e.,  develop  an  ad  aptive     
 probability density estimator for contrastive learners.   
 • Learn to Decide  – i.e., develop a sequential decision     
 learner for partially observable dynamic environments.    
 • Learn  to  Inference   –  i.e.,  develop  a  framework  f  or     
 distributed learning and collaborative inference on the edge.    
 The  practical  side  should  focus  on  the  analysis,  design,   
 implementation,  and  evaluation   with  specific  constrain  ts  on   
 end-user  applications  [ 11  4].  Solutions  pro  moting  well-being   
 and  quality   of  life  should  be  targeted.  For  ex  ample,  open   
 research  problems  (challenges)  from  EEG  -based  brain-   
 computer interaction (BCI)  can be used to  test and demonstrate   
 the  utility  of  learning  algorithms  [ 11  5].  ( This  section  is

 This  talk  starts  with  an  overview  on  the  rise  of   
 interpretable machine learning (I-ML), an  d briefly compares  the   
 two almost  opposite  recent  trends in  machine  learning,  end- to  -   
 end learnin  g and  I-ML.  Then a  recently  conceived  idea  for the   
 design  of  ODMTCNet,  a  unique  hybrid  architecture  for  image   
 feature  representation,  is  presented.  The  motivation  for  this   
 design is two  folds (the first  highlight of the  talk): 1) The human   
 brains learn naturally and coherently fro  m multiple information   
 streams, even  from data  collected  by a  single  type of  sensor, e.g.,    
 audio,  visual,  etc;  and  2)  The  prediction  by  Kolmogorov   
 Superposition Theorem on  neural  network-based representation.   
 Specifically,  ODM  TCNet  embeds  discriminant  canonical   
 correlation  analysis  (DCCA)  in  a  neural  network  ar  chitecture   
 and  features  two  key  in  terpretable  characteristics:  a)  Upper   
 bound on the number of  filters in each  CNN layer is analytically   
 determined;  b)  Training  is  acco  mplished  by  statistical   
 optimization.  Experimen  tal  results  co  nvincingly  suppo  rt  the   
 design with ODMTCNet soundly outperforming state- of  -the-art   
 methods.   
 Then comes  the  second highlight  of  the talk,  the reveal  of   
 several  stunning  properties  of  ODMTCNet:  1)  Optimal   
 performance  of  the  network  is  reached  with  only  2  -  3  neural   
 network  layers  (a  shallow  NN),  approaching  the  bound   
 predicted  in  Kolmogorov  Superposition  Theorem;  2)  The   
 number of free  parameters to  train in  ODMTCNet is  on the  scale   
 of  several  hundreds,  drastically  lower  than  the  hundreds  of   
 millions,  or  even  billions  of  free  parameters  in  state-  of  -the-art   
 DNNs and thus enabling training on CPU scale processors; 3) it   
 is  capable  of  working  with  small  samples,  complying  with   
 human experience th  at people can  generalize well from  a small   
 set of data samples; and 4) It is able to  take image features in all   
 popular formats as  input, pixel values,  hand-crafted features and   
 DNN  features,  and  shows  clearly  the  advantage  of   
 preprocessing.   
 Anticipation:  With  network  architecture  approaching   
 Kolmogorov's prediction and training on CPU scale processors,   
 ODMTCNet is  expected  to  open  up  a  new  and  accessible path   
 for  a ll   researchers  and  practitioners  interested  in  machine   
 learning  research  and real  -world  applications.   ( This  section  is

 Every day  more  computer-based  devices  are  connected  to   
 the internet. This is the idea behind the I  nternet of Things (IoT),   
 a  development  of  the  Internet  in  which  all  objects  have   
 network ed  connectivity, allowing them to send and receive data    
 and provide services to the users. Among these services  , Indoor   
 Positioning  Systems  (IPS),   Real  -Time  Locating  Systems   
 (RTLS),  and  Proximity  Based  Services  (PBS)  are  a  set  of   
 technologies  that  will  play  a  key  role  in  the  transformation  of   
 smart  infrastructure   [116],  [117],  [118],  [ 119 ]   .   Lo  calization  is   
 the  process  of  locating  any  entity  with  very  high  accuracy   
 (possibly in centimeters), while  PBS is a  suite of techniques  that   
 can be used  to personalize th  e experience  that a tenant  receives   
 from  the  surrounding  objects.  Such  tech  nologies  requir  e  high   
 detection accuracy, ene  rgy efficiency,  wide reception  range, low    
 cost, and  availability. In  this t  alk, we  will provide  insights i  nto   
 various  in  door  localization-enabling  technologies,  techniques,   
 and services.  We  will al  so dis  cuss how  they  can ac  celerate the    
 incorporation of IoT devices in smart city applications. We will   
 cover the challenges an  d propose some potential  solutions such   
 that indoor  localization-enabling  technologies  and  services can   
 be  thoroughly  integrated  with   IoT-  equipped  smart  city   
 applications.  ( This  section  is  contributed  by  Dr.  Petros

 Cognitive computers (κC) are intelligent processors advanced from data and information processing to autonomous knowledge learning and intelligence generation. This study presents a retrospective and prospective review of the odyssey toward κC empowered by transdisciplinary basic research and engineering advances. A wide range of fundamental theories and innovative technologies for κC is explored, and a set of underpinning intelligent mathematics (IM) is created. The architectures of κC for cognitive computing and Autonomous Intelligence Generation (AIG) are designed as a brain-inspired cognitive engine. Applications of κC in autonomous AI (AAI) are demonstrated by pilot projects. This study reveals that AIG will no longer be a privilege restricted only to humans via the odyssey to κC toward training-free and self-inferencing computers.

 It is recognized that the kernels of human knowledge and theories of abstract sciences have been archived in mathematical forms with indispensable generality and abstractedness. Intelligent Mathematics (IM) is contemporary mathematics for manipulating complex mathematical entities in the brain and intelligence systems known as hyperstructures (H) for formalizing rigorous expressions, inferences, and computational intelligence generation. H are nonnumerical abstract entities beyond those of real numbers (R) and bits (B). Therefore, IM becomes highly demanded across modern Abstract Sciences as counterparts of classic entity-oriented Concrete Sciences. IM is particularly demanded in Intelligent Science underpinning classic AI, autonomous AI (AAI) and contemporary Cognitive Computers (kC). In other words, IS may only be advanced based on IM rather than pretrained AI or preprogrammed technologies, because the inherent limitations of classic approaches may not be able to solve the fundamental challenges towards autonomous intelligence generation by kC. A pinnacle of IM is the recent proofs of the world top-ten hardest problems known as the Goldbach conjecture and the Twin-Prime conjecture by the author. IM has led to unprecedented theories and general methodologies for implementing kC towards autonomous intelligence generation by autonomous inference machines.

 Basic Research on Machine Vision Underpinned by Image Frame Algebra (VFA) and Visual Semantic Algebra (VSA) [Keynote]

 Computer vision [1], [2], [3], [4], [5] studies properties of machine vision, its semantic understanding, and general manipulations by Intelligent Mathematics (IM) [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. Computer vision has been studies from various aspects such as algorithmic methods, analysis methods, pattern recognition, and neural-network- regression (AI) technologies [2], [3]. However, there is a lack of fundamental theories for enabling autonomous image recognition and processing by machines. Basic research on contemporary IM has revealed that formal manipulations of visual objects by intelligent machines may be rigorously implemented by Image Frame Algebra (IFA) [8], [18] in the front-end and Visual Semantic Algebra (VSA) [19] in the back-end. IFA formally manipulates visual images as general 2D matrices by a set of algebraic operators such as modeling, analyses, syntheses, feature elicitation, and pattern recognition [4], [5], [18]. Then, its counterpart, VSA, transforms the geographic relations of visual objects to their semantic interpretations by algebraic analyses and compositions. The coherent theory of IFA and VSA provides a formal methodology for machine-enabled image processing and comprehension. This keynote presents a theoretical framework of machine vision underpinned by IFA and VSA for the structural denotations of visual objects and functional manipulations of visual mechanisms [3], [8], [9]. It demonstrates how the persistent challenges to machine vision may be rigorously and efficiently solved by the IFA/VSA methodology. Case studies on applying IFA/VSA for rigorous visual pattern detection, recognition, analysis, and composition in real world will be demonstrated [5], [18], [20]. As two coherent paradigms of IM, among others [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], IFA and VSA have been applied not only in robot visual and spatial reasoning, but also in computational intelligence and AI for rigorously representing and manipulating of visual objects and patterns by machine cognition and recognition [31], [32], [33], [34], [35] [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69], [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], [76], [77], [78], [79].

 The emergence of abstract sciences as a counterpart of classic concrete sciences is presented in this work. The framework of abstract sciences encompasses data, information, knowledge, and intelligence sciences from the bottom up. It is found that intelligence is the ultimate level of cognitive objects generated in human brains aggregated from data (sensory), information (cognition), and knowledge (comprehension). However, there is a lack of rigorous studies and coherent theories towards the theoretical framework of abstract sciences as the counterpart of classical concrete sciences. This paper explores the cognitive and mathematical models of abstract mental objects in the brain. The taxonomy and cognitive foundations of them are explored. A set of mathematical models of data, information, knowledge, and intelligence is formally created in intelligent mathematics. Based on the cognitive and mathematical models of the cognitive objects, formal properties and relationship of contemporary data, information, knowledge, and intelligence sciences are rigorously explained.

 Autonomous software requirement analysis and specifications is not only an ultimate goal of cognitive computing, but also a persistent challenge to theories and technologies of software engineering. A cognitive computing model is demanded to autonomously elicit and rigorously refine software requirements in order to generate a set of formal specifications. This paper presents a novel methodology for the design of a cognitive computing method for Software Requirement Elicitation and Specifications (SRES) based on the latest advances in software science and intelligent mathematics. SRES is implemented as an interactive system for capturing software requirements and generating formal specifications. The SRES methodology and experiments are demonstrated for solving real-world and complex software engineering problems enabled by cognitive computing theories underpinned by intelligent mathematics.

 On the Goldbach Theorem: A Formal Proof of Goldbach Conjecture by the Theory of Mirror Prime Decomposition (Keynote)    
   
 Conference Paper    
 Full-text available    
 Dec 2022 

 Yingxu Wang 
    
 This keynote lecture presents the proof of Goldbach Conjecture based on the author's recent discoveries: a) The universality and infinity properties of the set of Mirror Primes (Pu) adjacent to arbitrary even numbers; and b) The recursive property of Pu, P, and N beyond classical discrete or random treatments. They lead to the establishment of the Theorem of Mirror Prime Decompositions (MPD) as a necessary counterpart of the axiom of Euclidean Prime Factorization. The MPD theorem enables a formal proof of the Goldbach conjecture to be a rigorous theorem in number theory. The philosophy of this work are underpinned by the basic research initiative on Intelligent Mathematics (IM), which provides a set of unprecedented mathematical means for rigorously modeling and manipulating nontraditional abstract entities in contemporary sciences such as AI and computational intelligence in data science, knowledge science, and intelligence science for enabling machine knowledge learning, autonomous intelligence generation, and symbiotic human-machine societies.

 Astrocytes are increasingly understood to be important regulators of central nervous system (CNS) function in health and disease; yet, we have little quantitative understanding of their complex architecture. While broad categories of astrocytic structures are known, the discrete building blocks that compose them, along with their geometry and organizing principles, are poorly understood. Quantitative investigation of astrocytic complexity is impeded by the absence of high-resolution datasets and robust computational approaches to analyze these intricate cells. To address this, we produced four ultra-high-resolution datasets of mouse cerebral cortex using serial electron microscopy and developed astrocyte-tailored computer vision methods for accurate structural analysis. We unearthed specific anatomical building blocks, structural motifs, connectivity hubs, and hierarchical organizations of astrocytes. Furthermore, we found that astrocytes interact with discrete clusters of synapses and that astrocytic mitochondria are distributed to lie closer to larger clusters of synapses. Our findings provide a geometrically principled, quantitative understanding of astrocytic nanoarchitecture and point to an unexpected level of complexity in how astrocytes interact with CNS microanatomy.

  Cognitive computers (κC) are intelligent processors advanced from data and information processing to autonomous knowledge learning and intelligence generation. This study presents a retrospective and prospective review of the odyssey toward κC empowered by transdisciplinary basic research and engineering advances. A wide range of fundamental theories and innovative technologies for κC is ... [Show full abstract]  explored, and a set of underpinning intelligent mathematics (IM) is created. The architectures of κC for cognitive computing and Autonomous Intelligence Generation (AIG) are designed as a brain-inspired cognitive engine. Applications of κC in autonomous AI (AAI) are demonstrated by pilot projects. This study reveals that AIG will no longer be a privilege restricted only to humans via the odyssey to κC toward training-free and self-inferencing computers.

  The theoretical bottlenecks and technical challenges towards fully intelligent and autonomous AI are fundamentally rooted in current technologies of pretrained AI and preprogramed computing. Basic studies in contemporary Intelligence Science have revealed that the natural intelligence of the brain is not directly generated by data nor implemented by predetermined behaviors. This leads to ... [Show full abstract]  contemporary transdisciplinary investigations into the nature of general intelligence shared by human and machines, their theoretical foundations, and novel mathematical means for expressing and manipulating the unprecedented intelligent entities across the real and abstract worlds. It is discovered that human and machine intelligence is dually aggregated from (sensory | data), (neural signaling | information), (semantic networks | knowledge), and (autonomous behaviors | intelligence) in a recursive framework, where the former are embodied in neural structures of the brain, while the latter are represented in abstract (mathematical) forms in autonomous AI. Therefore, natural intelligence (NI) and AI are equivalent counterparts in philosophy and mathematics sharing a unified theoretical foundation of intelligence science represented by the Hierarchical Intelligence Model (HIM), which are compatible to those of human brain as revealed by the Layered Reference Model of the Brain. The unified theoretical framework of intelligence science based on HIM and LRMB has triggered Cognitive AI (CAI) and symbiotic human-machine intelligence underpinned by Intelligent Mathematics (IM). IM has shed light to the solving of challenging NI/AI problems by a rigorous and generic methodology. A pinnacle of IM is the recent proofs of the world top-ten hardest problems: the Goldbach conjecture and the Twin-Prime conjecture. Paradigms of IM encompass inference algebra, concept algebra, semantic algebra, real-time process algebra (RTPA), system algebra, causal probability algebra, big data algebra, image frame algebra, relation algebra, etc. IM leads to unprecedented theories and methodologies for implementing cognitive computers and cognitive robots towards a symbiotic NI and AI coherently sharable by human brain and intelligent machines in order to achieving the ultimate aims of intelligence science and autonomous computing.
