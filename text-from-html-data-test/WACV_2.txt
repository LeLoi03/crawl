  CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS   

 We invite workshop proposals for the 2023 IEEE Winter Conference of Applications on Computer Vision (WACV 2023). WACV 2023 is planned as an in-person conference with associated in-person workshops in Waikoloa, Hawaii, January 3-7, 2023. However, proposals for purely virtual workshops will also be considered.  
 The workshop proposals should focus on topics related to computer vision and its applications, interdisciplinary themes with other scientific and application areas, as well as emerging challenges or competitions. The format, style, and content of accepted workshops are under the control of the workshop organizers and largely autonomous from the main conference. Workshop organizers are expected to manage their technical programs, invite experts in the domain, and maintain a website for the workshop. Workshop registration and logistics will be handled by the main conference.  
 We encourage workshop proposals aimed at creating or strengthening communities.  
 Accepted workshops will be held on either 3 January 2023 or 7 January 2023. The workshop paper submission, review, acceptance notification, and final manuscript submission should all be handled between 10 October 2022 (tentative deadline for submission of workshop papers) and 19 November 2022 (firm camera-ready workshop paper due date).
