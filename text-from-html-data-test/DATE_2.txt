EDAA is the main sponsor of DATE, the premier Design, Automation and Test Conference in Europe.  
 EDAA Outstanding Dissertations Award 2025  
 In recognition of the importance of university research to the advancement of design, automation and test, and to encourage young researchers to work in the field, EDAA has established an award for outstanding Ph.D. dissertations in 4 categories:  
 Topic 1 – New directions in systems design methods and tools, simulation and validation, embedded software design and optimization for embedded, cyber-physical, secure and learning systems 
  Topic 2 – New directions in system-on-chip platforms co-design, novel architectures for future computing in design flows, and power management. 
  Topic 3 – New directions in logic, physical design and CAD for analog/mixed-signal, nanoscale and emerging technologies (such as quantum-, neuromorphic- or biological computing). 
  Topic 4 – New directions in safety, reliability, security-aware hardware design, validation and test 
  In each category, one award can be given. Each award consists of a 1000 € prize and certificate. The awards will be presented at the DATE 20 25   conference, where the awardees need to be present.  
 Nomination

 Wed, 17 Jul 2024 17:16   DATE 2025 - Call for Papers    
 The DATE conference is the main European event bringing together designers and design automation users, researchers and vendors as well as specialists in the hardware and software design, test and manufacturing of electronic circuits and systems. DATE puts a strong emphasis on both technology and systems, covering ICs/SoCs, reconfigurable hardware and embedded systems as well as embedded software.  
 The three-day event consists of a conference with regular papers, late breaking results papers and extended abstracts, complemented by timely keynotes, special days, focus sessions, embedded tutorials, half-day workshops and multi-partner project sessions. The event will also host the Young People Programme and unplugged sessions fostering the networking and the exchange of information on relevant issues, recent research outcomes and career opportunities.  
 DATE 20 25   is the 28th edition of an event that has always been the place for researchers, young professionals and industrial partners to meet, present their research and discuss the current development and next trends, with high emphasis on social interaction.  
 At DATE 20 25   , the DATE community, again, comes together for the conference in an intensive three-day format, focussing on interaction as well as further strengthening the community. The vast majority of regular papers will be presented in technical sessions using short flash-presentations, where the emphasis is on poster-supported live interactions (in addition to the common full-length presentation videos available before, during and after the conference). By this, we continue to focus on the core value of conferences: meeting, discussing and exchanging.

 Dr. Ingrid Verbauwhede is currently a full professor in the research group COSIC at KU Leuven and an adjunct professor at UCLA. She is recognized as a pioneer in hardware security. She is an expert in interdisciplinary research linking design for security with novel technologies and circuits as well as in investigating the requirements of novel cryptographic algorithms on secure hardware and HW/SW co-design. Her ability to cross the gap between cryptographic algorithm and protocol development, and actual implementation in hardware, software, and embedded systems has been widely recognized. In fact, she has made outstanding contributions, resulting in highly cited work, in several key aspects of EDA: electronic design for security, design automation and integration of security in digital EDA design flows, and test for security, with a focus on attacks and countermeasures to resist side-channel and fault attacks. Her work's application covers ASICs, FPGAs, and embedded microcontrollers. She has more than 450 publications in international journals and conferences and, according to Google Scholar, she has more than 30000 citations and an overall H-index of 90.
