 CLOSED: Call for Papers: IEEE VIS 2023  
 22 - 27 October 2023 | Melbourne, Australia   

 Share this on:           

 Submissions Due: 21 March 2023   
 Important Dates  
 Abstract Submission: | 21 March 2023 
  Paper Submission | : 31 March 2023 
  Conference Dates:  22-27 October 2023  
    
  In 2021, IEEE VIS  transitioned from the three sub-conferences (VAST, InfoVis, and SciVis) to one unified conference. IEEE VIS 2023 solicits novel research contributions and innovative applications in all areas of visualization.  
 Area 1: Theoretical & Empirical    
 This area focuses on theoretical and empirical research topics that aim to establish the foundation of VIS as a scientific subject. 
  Area 2: Applications    
 This area encompasses all forms of application-focused research. 
  Area 3: Systems & Rendering    
 This area focuses on the themes of building systems, algorithms for rendering, and alternate input and output modalities. 
  Area 4: Representations & Interaction    
 This area focuses on the design of visual representations and interaction techniques for different types of data, users, and visualization tasks. 
  Area 5: Data Transformations    
 This area focuses on the algorithms and techniques that transform data from one form to another to enable effective and efficient visual mapping as required by the intended visual representations. 
  Area 6: Analytics & Decisions    
 This area focuses on the design and optimization of integrated workflows for visual data analysis, knowledge discovery, decision support, machine learning, and other data intelligence tasks. 
  Where will papers appear?  Full papers accepted to IEEE VIS will appear in a special issue of the IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG) and will be indexed in IEEE Xplore  . Plan S has provided verbal approval of IEEE’s hybrid journal portfolio, including TVCG, for transformative status, allowing TVCG to accept articles from authors whose funders require Plan S  compliance.  
  Submission​ ​Guidelines  
 As the leading academic event on visualization research, IEEE VIS expects important, impactful, and potentially transformative contributions. Submissions will be judged on their scientific quality and novelty, potential impact, degree to which the evidence supports the findings, appropriateness of methodology, and the research process followed. After the initial notification of review results, selected papers are only conditionally accepted and will undergo a full revision and review cycle: only papers that improve according to the required changes will be accepted after the second round review.  
 IEEE VIS 2023 also features a separate short papers track. You can find more information in the | call for participation for short papers | . 
  When preparing your submission, please make sure that you carefully read and adhere to the | paper submission guidelines | . 
  Reviewers should be familiar with the | guidelines for reviewing papers for VIS | . 
    Open Access Policy  
 Visualization research is better communicated and acted on if it is freely accessible to the research community, practitioners, and the general public. Therefore, all paper authors are encouraged to share their accepted paper in an open access repository before the print deadline in accordance with IEEE copyright regulations. Additionally, funding agencies and research organisations may have specific rules such as Plan S compliance and it’s the authors responsibility to check and comply with their respective organizational rules. For instructions on how to post an accepted paper to an open access repository, please see the VIS Open Practices Guidelines (link coming soon)
