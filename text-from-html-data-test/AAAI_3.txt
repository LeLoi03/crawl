 Call for Participation  
 AAAI is pleased to present the AAAI-23 Workshop Program. Workshops will be held Monday and Tuesday, February 13-14, 2022. The final schedule will be available in November. The AAAI-23 workshop program includes 32 workshops covering a wide range of topics in artificial  
  intelligence. Workshops are one day unless otherwise noted in the individual descriptions. Registration in each workshop is required by all active participants, and is also open to all interested individuals. Workshop registration is available to AAAI-23 technical registrants as well. Registration information will be mailed directly to all invited participants in December.  

 Submission Requirements  
 Submission requirements vary for each workshop. Submissions are due to the organizers on November 4, 2022 (please check individual workshop websites for extensions). Please submit your papers for review directly to the individual workshop according to their directions. Do not mail submissions to AAAI. Workshop organizers will notify submitters of acceptance by November 18, 2022, unless otherwise noted on their supplementary website. If the organizer is planning a formal publication, they will provide specific information about how to submit camera-ready copy. For further information about a workshop, please contact the chair of that workshop.  
 Formats  
 AAAI two-column format is often preferred, but not required, for workshop submissions. The AAAI 2023 Press author kit with style files, macros, and guidelines for this format is linked below. (Note that the 2023 author kit includes a AAAI copyright slug, which should be removed for workshop publications.)
