  Terms & Conditions  
 All cancellations received on or before March 20, 2023, are entitled to a refund, minus a $50 processing fee.  No refunds will be given after March 20th. Regrettably, cancellations received after that date cannot be honored. The conference committee recognizes that sometimes last-minute cancellations can’t be avoided. However, the conference incurs expenses for which it is liable based on registration counts. Cancellations must be submitted in writing to [email protected]   . Registrants who find themselves unable to attend should be aware that registrations are transferable, but in general the conference committee cannot assist in finding an appropriate replacement. Substitutions for paid registrants may be made up until April 21, 2023 with written notice to [email protected]   .  
 In the event that you need to change from an in-person conference registration to a virtual conference registration,  CHI will grant a refund for the difference. Changes in registration must be sent to [email protected]   on or before Friday, April 21st.  
 In the event that the workshop is canceled due to circumstances beyond the organizers’ control, refunds are not guaranteed  . If refunds are issued, the amount will depend on the expenses and financial commitments incurred by the workshop as of the cancellation date.  
 Student registration rates are for full-time students only.
