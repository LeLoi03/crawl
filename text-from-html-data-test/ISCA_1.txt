 Keynote: Computing in the Foundation Model Era   
 Location: Cypress 2  
   
 Abstract   
  Generative AI applications with their ability to produce natural language, computer code and images are transforming all aspects of society. These applications are powered by huge foundation models such as GTP-3 which are trained on massive unlabeled datasets. Foundation models have 10s of billions of parameters and have obtained state-of-the-art quality in natural language processing, vision and speech applications. These models are computationally challenging because they require 100s of petaFLOPS of computing capacity for training and inference. Future foundation models will have even greater capabilities provided by more complex model architectures with longer sequence lengths, irregular data access (sparsity) and irregular control flow. In this talk I will describe how the evolving characteristics of foundation models will impact the design of the optimized computing systems required for training and serving these models. A key element of improving the performance and lowering the cost of deploying future foundation models will be optimizing the data movement within the model using specialized hardware. In contrast to human-in-the-loop applications such as conversational AI, an emerging application of foundation models is in continuous batch processing applications that operate without human supervision. I will describe how continuous batch processing and real-time machine learning can be used to create an intelligent network data plane.

 Keynote: Taking on the World's Challenges: The Role of Computing Research and Innovation   
 Location: Cypress 2  
   
 Abstract   
  Throughout human history, society has faced great opportunities and challenges, and has used its available toolkit to navigate them. Today, many of the global opportunities and challenges we face will require the full engagement of the computing innovation and research community to take on. Resiliently navigating climate trends will require computing techniques and systems to model the future, as well as innovative techniques to mitigate carbon footprint by employing telepresence, optimizing logistics, and more. Another grand challenge of our era is the ability for us as individuals and as groups to communicate with each other in a way that upholds accuracy, integrity, privacy, and trust. The computing research and innovation ecosystem has the power to help. This talk will discuss how the different elements of this ecosystem — academia, industry, professional organizations, and governments — can work together to meet these challenges. It will be a call to action on how we can best navigate the next decade and beyond to do so.

 Title: Reflecting on 50 Years of Computing Research, and Future Outlook   
 Location: Cypress 2  
   
 Abstract   
  The conferences at FCRC represent areas that have laid the foundation for computing. As part of its 50th anniversary celebration, the Computing Research Association (CRA) is organizing this panel to reflect on the contributions of the field by the communities represented by these conferences. The panelists will discuss global computing research and its impact, digging into the evolution of programming languages, computer architecture, parallel and distributed computing, theory, and AI. We will consider how technological advances and external forces -- such as industry and government organizations — shaped this evolution. Given a present where computing is transforming every industry and every facet of daily life, it is a good time to recall the critical steps that brought the field to this point. The panelists will share perspectives on the future by considering what has been learned from computing’s past.

 Keynote: Constructing and Deconstructing Trust: Employing Cryptographic Recipe in the ML Domain   
 Location: Cypress 2  
   
 Abstract   
  For decades now cryptographic tools and models have been developed to transform platforms controlled by worst case adversaries to trustworthy platforms. In this talk I will describe how to use a general cryptographic recipe and specific cryptographic tools to build trust in various phases of the machine learning pipelines or prove that at times it is impossible to achieve. We will touch on achieving verification, robustness and privacy. If time permits, we will show how cryptographic tools can be brought to build trust in the legal domain.
