 EMMSAD 2025   

 EMMSAD is a two-day international working conference on Exploring Modeling Methods for Systems Analysis and Development. The  30th  event of EMMSAD will be held on June 16-17, 2024 co-located with  CAiSE 2025    in Vienna, Austria.   
 EMMSAD aims to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners interested in modeling methods for Systems Analysis and Development to meet and exchange research ideas and results.   
 The best paper will  receive an award  . Furthermore, all  candidates for the best paper award  will also be invited to submit enhanced versions for consideration in a special issue of  Software and System Modelling (SoSyM) journal   . The status of the special issues can be viewed in the  publication section   .
