 Conference Program   
 Rough Sets were introduced by Zdzisław Pawlak in the early '80s and developed further as a method of knowledge representation and processing on the basis of uncertain data and incomplete information. Nowadays, Rough Set theory is widely recognised to have great importance in several fields, including artificial intelligence, mathematics, knowledge representation and machine learning, as evidenced by the increasing number of works concerned with its applications and theoretical foundations.  
  
 The 2023 International Joint Conference on Rough Sets (IJCRS 2023) will take place in Krakow (Poland) from October 5 to October 8, 2023, and will be hosted by the Department of Applied Computer Science of the AGH University of Science and Technology. IJCRS is the principal international conference sponsored by the International Rough Set Society (IRSS).  

  The aim of the IJCRS conference is to be the main location for disseminating novel foundational results and practical applications, enabling the discussion of problems and exchange of ideas, as well as bringing together academic and industrial perspectives, centred around rough sets and related disciplines (such as granular computing, three-way decisions and fuzzy sets).  
  
 Our goal is to invite you to join both IJCRS and ECAI  conferences and enjoy beautiful historical city of Krakow at the beginning of October!  
 Best regards,

  Conference Chairs of IJCRS 2023  

 Paper Submission, Fees & Registration  
 There are two types of submissions:  
 Full papers (12–16 pages) will be published in the LNCS/LNAI Springer post-proceedings 
  Extended abstracts (1–4 pages) will be published in the online pdf book of abstracts 
  Both forms will be treated equally: when designing the conference program of oral presentations 
  when selecting materials for the special issue in one of international journals 
  Papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. All accepted papers must be presented at the conference, and will be published in the conference post-proceedings, both in print and digitally. (By Springer in the LNCS/LNAI series, barring any unforeseen circumstances.)  
 Abstracts may describe work-in-progress as well as research that has been published elsewhere during the past year. Abstracts will not be included in the post-proceedings but must be presented at the conference.  
 All submissions must be prepared in the LNCS/LNAI Springer format   
  
 REGISTRATION FEES:  
 1. Regular onsite: 500 EUR  
 2. Student onsite: 400 EUR  
 3. Regular online: 300 EUR  
 4. Student online: 200 EUR  
 5. Non-author online: 100 EUR  
  
 Registration fee is the necessary condition to include a paper / abstract in the conference program.  

  Note that for this edition IJCRS will have post-proceedings: informal pre-proceedings will be shared for exclusive use of the conference participants before the conference.  
 Papers on the topics of the conference (see list below) that have been rejected as borderline from ECAI are welcome for submission to IJCRS and will be considered and re-reviewed in the context of IJCRS.  
 Each submitted paper will be reviewed by at least three independent and anonymous reviewers.  
 The submission address is: https://equinocs.springernature.com/service/IJCRS2023

 Plenary Panel On Intelligent Informatics  
 Artificial Intelligence has captured public's imagination with the recent commercial release of Generative AI applications. This panel will discuss the current state of AI and near future research opportunities. We will explore the following issues:  
   
 What are practical problems that you think AI is likely to provide solutions for over next decade? 
  What subset of these problems comes under the umbrella of intelligent informatics? 
  What are the strengths and weaknesses of the recent Generative AI applications? 
  Where does soft computing in general and rough sets in particular fit into the post ChatGPT world? 
  Provide supplementary techniques and algorithms? 
  Benefit from large deep learning models to solve long standing problems in soft computing? 
  Provide better knowledge representations? 
  How have recent advances in AI affected your research plans?
