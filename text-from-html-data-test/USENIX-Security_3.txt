 USENIX Security '23 Call for Papers  

 USENIX Security '23 is SOLD OUT.  
 Please do not plan to walk into the venue and register on site.  
  The event has reached maximum physical capacity, and we will not be able to accommodate any additional registrations.  

 The USENIX Security Symposium brings together researchers, practitioners, system administrators, system programmers, and others interested in the latest advances in the security and privacy of computer systems and networks. The 32nd USENIX Security Symposium will be held August 9–11, 2023, in Anaheim, CA.  
 Important:  In 2023, we are introducing substantial changes to the review process, aimed to provide a more consistent path towards acceptance and reduce the number of times papers reenter the reviewing process. Detailed information is available at USENIX Security Publication Model Changes  .   
 All researchers are encouraged to submit papers covering novel and scientifically significant practical works in computer security.

 Symposium Topics  
 Refereed paper submissions are solicited in all areas relating to systems research in security and privacy. This topic list is not meant to be exhaustive; USENIX Security is interested in all aspects of computing systems security and privacy. Papers without a clear application to security or privacy of computing systems, however, will be considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review.

 Refereed Papers  
 Papers that have been formally reviewed and accepted will be presented during the Symposium and published in the Symposium Proceedings. By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it. Alternative arrangements will be made if global health concerns persist. If the conference registration fee will pose a hardship for the presenter of the accepted paper, please contact conference@usenix.org  .  
 A major mission of the USENIX Association is to provide for the creation and dissemination of new knowledge. In keeping with this and as part of USENIX's open access policy, the Proceedings will be available online for registered attendees before the Symposium and for everyone starting on the opening day of the technical sessions. USENIX also allows authors to retain ownership of the copyright in their works, requesting only that USENIX be granted the right to be the first publisher of that work. See our sample consent form  for the complete terms of publication.  
 Go to Paper Submission Policies and Instructions  page for more information.  
 Artifact Evaluation  
 View the Call for Artifacts  .  
 Symposium Activities  
 Invited Talks, Panels, Poster Session, Lightning Talks, and BoFs   
  In addition to the refereed papers and the keynote presentation, the technical program will include invited talks, panel discussions, a poster session, lightning talks, and Birds-of-a-Feather sessions (BoFs). You are invited to make suggestions regarding topics or speakers in any of these sessions via email to the contacts listed below or to the program co-chairs at sec23chairs@usenix.org  .  
   
 Invited Talks and Panel Discussions  
 Invited talks and panel discussions will be held in parallel with the refereed paper sessions. Please submit topic suggestions and talk and panel proposals via email to sec23it@usenix.org  by January 31, 2023.  
   
 Poster Session  
 Would you like to share a provocative opinion, an interesting preliminary work, or a cool idea that will spark discussion at this year's USENIX Security Symposium? The poster session is the perfect venue to introduce such new or ongoing work (note that this year all poster submissions should present unpublished work). Poster presenters will have the entirety of the evening reception to discuss their work, get exposure, and receive feedback from attendees.  
 To submit a poster, please submit a draft of your poster, in PDF (maximum size 36" by 48"), or a one-page abstract via the poster session submission form  by July 6, 2023. Decisions will be made by July 13, 2023. Posters will not be included in the proceedings but may be made available online if circumstances permit. Poster submissions must include the authors' names, affiliations, and contact information. At least one author of each accepted poster must register for and attend the Symposium to present the poster.  
  Lightning Talks  
 We will host a Lightning Talks session (also previously known as Work-in-Progress/Rump session) on the evening of Wednesday, August 9, 2023. This is intended as an informal session of short and engaging presentations on recent unpublished results, work in progress, or other topics of interest to USENIX Security attendees. As in the past, talks do not always need to be serious and funny talks are encouraged! For full consideration, submit your lightning talk via the lightning talk submission form  , through Wednesday, July 26, 2023, 11:59 pm AoE. You can continue submitting talks via the submission form until Monday, August 7, 2023, 12:00 pm PDT. However, due to time, there is no guarantee of full consideration after the initial deadline.  
 Birds-of-a-Feather Sessions (BoFs)  
 Birds-of-a-Feather sessions (BoFs) will be held Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday evenings. Birds-of-a-Feather sessions are informal gatherings of persons interested in a particular topic. BoFs often feature a presentation or a demonstration followed by discussion, announcements, and the sharing of strategies. BoFs can be scheduled on-site or in advance. To schedule a BoF, please send an email to the USENIX Conference Department at bofs@usenix.org  with the title and a brief description of the BoF; the name, title, affiliation, and email address of the facilitator; and your preference of date and time.
