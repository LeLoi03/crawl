 VINCI 2024    
  
 Visual communication through graphical or sign languages has long been conducted among human beings of different backgrounds or cultures, and in recent decades between humans and machines. In today's digital world, visual information is typically encoded with various metaphors commonly used in daily life to facilitate rapid comprehension and easy analysis during the communication process. Visual information communication generally encompasses information visualization, graphical user interfaces, visual analytics, and visual languages. Visual information is increasingly being used to facilitate human-human communication through the Internet and mobile devices.   
 VINCI is the premier international forum for researchers and industrial practitioners to discuss the state of the art in visual communication theories, designs, and applications.  The 17th International Symposium on Visual Information Communication and Interaction   (VINCI'24)   will be held during  December   11  -  13  , 2024, in Hsinchu, Taiwan.   
 VINCI'24 includes tracks of  Technical Papers  ,  Art Papers  , and  Art and Media Galleries  . All accepted papers will be included in the ACM Proceedings as formal publications and EI-indexed. Selected papers will be invited to be extended for publication i  n special issues of  PRESENCE: Virtual and Augmented Reality   (SCI-indexed; MIT Press; 3-4 papers for fast-tracked review in 2 months) and   International Journal of Digital Media Design   (Taiwan Humanities Core Index)  .   

 Paper Submission    
  
 Submissions that address research and development and experience reports on the above topics are strongly encouraged. Papers can be submitted as full papers, short papers and posters. Art and Media Galleries can be submitted as media demos and artworks. Each submitted symposium paper will be peer-reviewed by at least three International Program Committee members. You are welcome to submit a paper to VINCI 2024. All accepted papers and posters will appear in the proceedings of VINCI 2024 published by ACM ICPS and made available in the  ACM Digital Library   (EI indexed).

 All paper submissions should be made through the  CMT    conference management system. The review process will be single-blind. We encourage to submit an anonymized version of your manuscript by removing all author and affiliation information from submissions and supplemental files as well as substituting your paper's ID number for the author's name.
