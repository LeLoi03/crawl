 As the first international conference in networking science & practice, ITC was founded in 1955 by enthusiastic scientists and engineers willing to deploy networks in a holistic way. During the past 66 years, it has served as a forum for all theoretical fundamentals and engineering practices for large-scale deployment and operation of communication and information networks. Following the successful 19th ITC’2005 in Beijing and 25th ITC 2013 in Shanghai, the 34th ITC will come back to China again, to be held in another most innovative city of Shenzhen on 14-16 September, 2022 under the theme of “Teletraffic Engineering for Smart Networking”. You are warmly welcome to come and see the miracle city of Shenzhen and the appealing ICT industry there led by Huawei, ZTE, Tencent, Dajiang, etc. Full details of submission procedures are available on the ITC 2022 website. Main Conference (MC) Authors are invited to submit original scientific papers to the main conference for presentation and publication in the Conference Proceedings. Best paper(s) will be selected from accepted papers. To better match your papers to most appropriate TPC members and reviewers, the authors are suggested to select one field from the following four major areas: 1. Traffic Modeling and Queueing Theory (MQ) 2. Data Science and Analytics (DA) 3. Machine Learning for Teletraffic Engineering (ML) 4. Network Science and Resource Management (NR) Invited Tracks (IT) Proposals for organizing Invited Sessions on selected topics together with the tentative invited speakers should be submitted to the corresponding chair. Chair: Shuguang Cui (The Chinese Univ. of Hong Kong, shuguangcui@cuhk.edu.cn) Tutorials (TU) Proposals are sought for Tutorials on the latest topics in network science and traffic engineering , which should be first submitted to the corresponding chairs for review . Chair: Kohei Shiomoto (Tokyo City Univ., shiomoto@tcu.ac.jp) Panels (PA) Proposals are sought for Panels on the latest topics in network science and traffic engineering, which should be first submitted to the corresponding chairs for review. Chair: Sabine Wittevrongel (Univ. of Gent, Sabine.Wittevrongel@ugent.be) Workshops (WS) Workshops with the most latest research results on a specific topic are also welcome. The proposals should be first submitted to the corresponding chairs for review. Chair: Zhiyuan Jiang (Shanghai Univ., jiangzhiyuan@shu.edu.cn)  最后更新 Dou Sun  在 2023-06-11
