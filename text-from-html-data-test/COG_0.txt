 Call for Papers      

 Remote Policy    
  In discussion with members of the community, IEEE CoG 2023 will be primarily an in-person conference. However, the organization acknowledges that for a wide variety of reasons not all members can physically attend the conference and that traveling may simply be impossible. Therefore, the conference will provide the possibility for remote presentation (prerecorded but live streamed) for remote authors. At least one remote author must register for the conference by the payment of one regular registration (IEEE Member or Non-Member). After registration, make an official request for remote presentation using this form: https://forms.gle/TM9iJ96zf1LBVjHw8   

 Code of Conduct    
  IEEE CoG 2023 follows IEEE’s nondisrimination policy  , which prohibits discrimination, harassment, and bullying against any person for any reason (e.g., age, race, political affiliation), and IEEE’s Code of Ethics  , which commits members to the highest ethical and professional conduct. The organization further commits to providing a harassment-free, accessible, and pleasant conference experience where every participant feels welcome and included. Participants can contact any member of the Organization  in confidence. They can also make use of IEEE’s Ethics Reporting Line  .
