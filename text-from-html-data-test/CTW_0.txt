 19th Cologne-Twente Workshop on  
  Graphs and Combinatorial Optimization   
 June 20 - 22, 2023, Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany   

 Welcome  
   The Cologne-Twente Workshop on Graphs and Combinatorial Optimization 2023 welcomes contributions on theory and applications of discrete algorithms, graphs and combinatorial optimization in the wider sense.  
 The series of Cologne-Twente Workshops on Graphs and Combinatorial Optimization started with meetings organized every two years by the universities of Cologne and Twente. The organizational base was later expanded by other universities. Since 2003 the workshop is held (almost) every year.  
 CTWs are especially intended to let doctoral students and young researchers present the results of their research activities in a friendly and highly interactive atmosphere.
