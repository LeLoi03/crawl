 About

  Call for Papers 
  Formal techniques can help analyse programs, precisely describe program behaviour, and verify program properties. Modern programming languages are interesting targets for formal techniques due to their ubiquity and wide user base, stable and well-defined interfaces and platforms, and powerful (but also complex) libraries. New languages and applications in this space are continually arising, resulting in new programming languages (PL) research challenges.  
 Work on formal techniques and tools and on the formal underpinnings of programming languages themselves naturally complement each other. FTfJP is an established workshop which has run annually since 1999 alongside ECOOP, with the goal of bringing together people working in both fields.  
 The workshop has a broad PL theme. The most important criterion is that submissions will generate interesting discussions within this community. The term “Java-like” is somewhat historic and should be interpreted broadly: FTfJP solicits and welcomes submissions relating to programming languages in general, beyond Java, including submissions related to C#, Scala, and similar languages, and submissions on more general topics that may be relevant to such languages.  
 Example topics of interest include:  
 Language design and semantics 
  Type systems 
  Concurrency and new application domains 
  Specification and verification of program properties 
  Program analysis (static or dynamic) 
  Program synthesis 
  Security 
  Pearls (programs or proofs) 
  FTfJP welcomes submissions on technical contributions, case studies, experience reports, challenge proposals, and position papers.

 Time Band   
   
 By setting a time band, the program will dim events that are outside this time window. This is useful for (virtual) conferences with a continuous program (with repeated sessions).  
  The time band will also limit the events that are included in the personal iCalendar subscription service.   Display full program    Specify a time band   -

 Call for Papers  
  
 Contributions are sought in two categories:  
 Full Papers (6 pages, excluding references) present a technical contribution, case study, or detailed experience report. We welcome both complete and incomplete technical results; ongoing work is particularly welcome, provided it is substantial enough to stimulate interesting discussions. 
  Short Papers (2 pages, excluding references) should advocate a promising research direction, or otherwise present a position likely to stimulate discussion at the workshop. We encourage e.g. established researchers to set out a personal vision, and beginning researchers to present a planned path to a PhD. 
  All submissions and reviews will be managed within EasyChair. Submissions should be made via https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ftfjp2023  . There is no need to indicate the paper category (long/short).  
 Both types of contributions will benefit from feedback received at the workshop. Submissions will be peer reviewed, and will be evaluated based on their clarity and their potential to generate interesting discussions. Reviewing will be single blind, there is no need to anonymize submissions.  
 The format of the workshop encourages interaction. FTfJP is a forum in which a wide range of people share their expertise, from experienced researchers to beginning PhD students.  
 All authors should use the official “ACM Master article template”, which can be obtained from the ACM Proceedings Template pages ( https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template  ). Latex users should use the “sigconf” option as well as “review” (to produce line numbers for easy reference by the reviewers). To that end, the following latex code can be placed at the start of the latex document: \documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart}   
 All questions about submissions should be emailed to Aaron Tomb aarontomb@gmail.com
