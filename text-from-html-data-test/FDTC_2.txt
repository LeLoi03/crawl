FDTC 2023: Workshop History  
 People and topics  
 The Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography (FDTC) workshop brings together researchers and engineers from academia and industry who have an interest in the effect of faults, accidental or malicious, on digital devices that implement cryptographic algorithms.  
 The FDTC workshop includes topics such as: modeling the reliability of cryptographic systems and protocols; reliable cryptographic systems and algorithms; fault models for HW and SW cryptographic devices; fault injection attacks on cryptographic systems and protocols; classical and novel techniques of fault diagnosis and tolerance for cryptographic systems; and case studies.  
 Foundation and sequel  
 To promote the exchange of ideas among active researchers in this field, the first workshop devoted to Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography (FDTC) was organized in June 2004 in Florence, Italy. The workshop has since then become an annual event which travels through Europe, America and Asia.  
 A selection of papers from the first three sessions of FDTC (2004-05-06) is published in the LNCS series by Springer-Verlag and is available via SpringerLink  . Since 2007, the proceedings of FDTC are published by Conference Publishing Services and are available on the IEEE Digital Library  .
