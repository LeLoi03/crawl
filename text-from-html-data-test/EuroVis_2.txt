 EuroVis 2023 in Leipzig  

 June 26, 2023 

 The 25th Eurographics Conference on Visualization  ( EuroVis 2023  )  was hosted as an in-presence event at the Leipzig University, in Germany, from June 12 to 16. Our researchers Marc Satkowski and Julián Méndez had the pleasure of attending the wonderful talks, with Julián also presenting our invited Computer Graphics Forum  ( CGF  )  article “ Evonne: A Visual Tool For Explaining Reasoning with OWL Ontologies and Supporting Interactive Debugging  “, a result of our collaborative work within the Transregional Collaborative Research Centre 248 ( CPEC  )  .  
   
  EuroVis is the annual Visualization Conference organized by the Eurographics Working Group on Data Visualization. It has been a Eurographics and IEEE co-supported international visualization symposium held in Europe annually since 1999, as a conference since 2012. This year’s event saw many advances with respect to visualization of scalar and vector fields, networks and hypergraphs, high-dimensional data, machine learning processes and parameter spaces, as well as contributions towards visual analytics, perception, interaction and immersion.
