 Guimarães (Portugal) - Hybrid  
 12th-14th July, 2023  

 20th International Conference on Distributed Computing and Artificial Intelligence  
 Guimarães (Portugal) | 12th-14th July, 2023 | www.dcai-conference.net   

  The 20th International Conference on Distributed Computing and Artificial Intelligence 2023 is an annual forum that will bring together ideas, projects and knowledge associated with distributed computing and artificial intelligence, and their application in different areas. This meeting will be held in Guimarães (Portugal) within PAAMS'23  , from 12th to 14th July, 2023.  
 Nowadays, most computing systems, ranging from personal laptops/computers to cluster/grid/cloud computing systems, are capable of parallel and distributed computing. Distributed computing performs an increasingly important role in modern signal/data processing, information fusion and electronics engineering (e.g., electronic commerce, mobile communications and wireless devices). Particularly, applying artificial intelligence in distributed environments is becoming an element of high added value and economic potential. Research on Intelligent Distributed Systems has matured over the last decade and many effective applications are now being deployed. Artificial intelligence is changing our society. Its application in distributed environments, such as the Internet, electronic commerce, mobile communications, wireless devices, distributed computing, is becoming more widespread, and is becoming an element of high added value and economic potential, in both industry and research. These technologies are changing constantly as a result of the large research and technical effort being undertaken in both universities and businesses. The exchange of ideas between scientists and technicians from both academic and business backgrounds is essential to facilitating the development of systems that meet the demands of today's society. Technology transfer in this field is still a challenge and for that reason this type of contributions will be given special consideration at this symposium.
