 Introduction  
   
 The 13th International Conference on Pattern Recognition Systems (ICPRS) is an annual event that follows ICPRS-22, ICPRS-21, ICPRS-19, ICPRS-18, ICPRS-17 and ICPRS-16, a continuation of the successful Chilean Conference on Pattern Recognition that reached its 6th edition in 2014. In 2023 it is organised by the Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral (Guayaquil - Ecuador) and the Chilean Association for Pattern Recognition (ACHiRP, a member of the IAPR), endorsed by the IAPR (International Association for Pattern Recognition) and co-sponsored by IEEE Ecuador Chapter, IEEE CIS Society. As in previous years, papers deemed to be of the required standard AND presented at the conference, will be normally indexed in IEEE Xplore. Please note that the publishers might reject papers which are too similar to previous publications, even if the work is presented at the conference. All paper submissions need to be submitted via Conftool to be peer-reviewed by an international panel of experts.  
 Sponsor Type:3; 5; 5
