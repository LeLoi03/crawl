 Welcome to FLINS 2022 and ISKE 2022   
 FLINS, an acronym introduced in 1994 and originally for Fuzzy Logic and Intelligent Technologies in Nuclear Science, is now extended into a well-established international research forum to advance the foundations and applications of computational intelligence for applied research in general and for complex engineering and decision support systems.    

 The principal mission of FLINS is bridging the gap between machine intelligence and real complex systems via joint research between universities and international research institutions, encouraging interdisciplinary research and bringing multidiscipline researchers together.   

 FLINS 2022 is the fifteenth in a series of conferences on Machine learning, Multi agent and Cyber physical systems. The conference will be held in  Tianjin, China ( Conference Venue  )  . It follows the successful previous FLINS Conferences since 1994, where these conference information can be seen in  Introduction to FLINS  . FLINS 2022 will be jointly held with the 17th International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Knowledge Engineering (ISKE2022).    

 FLINS 2022 will be again published as a book by the World Scientific and it will be  included in the ISI proceedings, EI Compendex for indexing as well as indexed in Scopus. Special issues of several (   Sustainability, International Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems     and     Journal of Smart Environments and Green Computing   ) SCI indexed journals  will be devoted to a strict refereed selection of extended papers.
