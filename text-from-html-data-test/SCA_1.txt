 SCA 2024   
 The 23rd annual Symposium on Computer Animation (SCA) will take place in Montréal, Canada, from August 21 to August 23, 2024.  
 SCA is the premier forum for innovations in the software and technology of computer animation. It unites researchers and practitioners working on all aspects of time-based phenomena. Our focused, intimate gathering, with a single track program and emphasis on community interaction, makes SCA the best venue to exchange research results, get inspired, and set up collaborations.  
 We invite submission of original, high-quality papers and posters on computer animation, broadly defined as computation dealing with time-varying phenomena. Accepted full papers will be published in the journal Computer Graphics Forum  , a leading journal for in-depth technical articles on computer graphics. Posters will be published in the conference proceedings indexed by ACM and Eurographics. Best Paper Awards will be given to excellent submissions that push the leading edge. Please refer to our call-for-paper  page for paper submission information.
