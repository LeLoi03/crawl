 Welcome!  
   
 The Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education is organized by the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE)  and is the organization’s flagship conference. The SIGCSE Technical Symposium addresses problems common among educators working to develop, implement and/or evaluate computing programs, curricula, and courses. The symposium provides a forum for sharing new ideas for syllabi, laboratories, and other elements of teaching and pedagogy, at all levels of instruction. The symposium provides a diverse selection of technical sessions and opportunities for learning and interaction.  
 SIGCSE TS 2023 will be held from March 15 - 18, 2023. The conference is hybrid with both online and in-person attendance options. All in-person sessions will take place in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
