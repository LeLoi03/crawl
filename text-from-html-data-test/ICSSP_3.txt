 International Software and Systems Process Association  

 Advancing software and other processes in science, technology, and practice    

 Who We Are  

 The ISSPA is an association for software engineers, systems engineers, and other professionals with a special interest in process as a distinguished field of research and development.  

 The ISSPA originated from the idea that software engineering can make distinctive contributions to the study of process. It recognizes, however, that processes broadly are multidimensional in their influences, concerns, and impacts; hence, it welcomes contributions from across scientific, engineering, social, and other disciplines.

 What We Do  

 The ISSPA has organized the annual International Conference on Software and Systems Process (ICSSP) since 2011. ICSSP 2024  (ISSP 18) was colocated with EuroSPI 2   in September, 2024 in Munich, Germany.   
   
 ICSSP 17  was held in Melbourne in May, 2023 in collaboration with the Data61 group of the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. Proceedings of past ICSSP conferences have been published by the ACM Special Interest Group in Software Engineering, the IEEE Computer Society Press, and Elsevier Lecture Notes in Computer Science. You can find out more about upcoming and past ICSSP conferences here  .

 Why It Matters  

 Software is ubiquitous in the world today. The ability to address the demanding and often conflicting requirements for critical software and software-based systems starts with the processes by which the software is developed, deployed, used, and maintained.  

 These processes, which we refer to as the domain of software and systems process, are a point of origin for consequences that radiate to individuals, institutions, society, and the environment. Software and systems processes therefore play a fundamental role in determining the character and quality of modern life. For that reason, the ISSPA believes that advancing both the state of the art and the state of the practice in software and systems process is vital to the future prosperity and security of the world.
