 Call for papers, 39th conference on the Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics  
 Deadline:  3/31/2023  
 CALL FOR PAPERS: MFPS XXXIX (MFPS 2023) 39th Conference on Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics June 20-23, 2023 in Bloomington, IN, USA Joint with CALCO https://coalg.org/calco-mfps-2023/mfps/ ========================================================== IMPORTANT DATES (anywhere on earth): Abstract Submission: March 24, 2023 Paper Submission: March 31, 2023 Notification: May 10, 2023 Pre-proceedings : May 24, 2023 Final (post-proceeding) versions : Autumn 2023 ========================================================== We are delighted to announce the 39th Conference on the Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics (MFPS 2023). It will take place at Indiana University Bloomington, with an option for remote participation. MFPS conferences are dedicated to the areas of mathematics, logic, and computer science that are related to models of computation in general, and to semantics of programming languages in particular. This is a forum where researchers in mathematics and computer science can meet and exchange ideas. The participation of researchers in neighbouring areas is strongly encouraged. Topics include, but are not limited to, the following: bio-computation; concurrent qualitative and quantitative distributed systems; process calculi; probabilistic systems; constructive mathematics; domain theory and categorical models; formal languages; formal methods; game semantics; lambda calculus; programming language theory; quantum computation; security; topological models; logic; type systems; type theory. We also welcome contributions that address applications of semantics to novel areas. ------------------------------------------------- INVITED SPEAKERS: Robert Harper, Carnegie Mellon University (Joint with CALCO) Assia Mahboubi, Inria (Joint with CALCO) Azalea Raad, Imperial College London Alex Simpson, University of Ljubljana ------------------------------------------------- SPECIAL SESSIONS: TO BE ANNOUNCED ------------------------------------------------- PROGRAM COMMITTEE: Henning Basold, LIACS, Leiden University Andrej Bauer, University of Ljubljana Robin Cockett, University of Calgary Liron Cohen, Ben-Gurion University Adrian Francalanza, University of Malta Francesco Gavazzo, University of Pisa Sergey Goncharov, Dept. of Comput.
