 POPL 2023  
   
 Welcome to the website of the 50th ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL 2023). For the fiftieth POPL and the 50th anniversary of POPL, we will be back where POPL #1 happened: Boston, Massachusetts.  
 The annual Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages is a forum for the discussion of all aspects of programming languages and programming systems. Both theoretical and experimental papers are welcome on topics ranging from formal frameworks to experience reports. We seek submissions that make principled, enduring contributions to the theory, design, understanding, implementation or application of programming languages.  
 The symposium is sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN, in cooperation with ACM SIGACT and ACM SIGLOG.  
   
 The talk recordings are now available on SIGPLAN youtube channel  :
