 18 - 24 September 2023, 7th International Joint Conference on Rules and Reasoning (RuleML+RR 2023), Oslo, Norway  
 Date: 18 - 24 September 2023   
 Location: Oslo, Norway   
 Deadline: Monday 20 March 2023   
 The 7th International Joint Conference on Rules and Reasoning (RuleML+RR 2023) is the leading international joint conference in the field of rule-based reasoning. One of the main goals of RuleML+RR is to build bridges between academia and industry in the area of semantic reasoning.  
 The RuleML+RR 2023 conference is part of the event “Declarative AI: Rules, Reasoning, Decisions, and Explanations” and is co-located with DecisionCAMP 2023 and the Reasoning Web Summer School. It features the RuleChallenge and a Doctoral Consortium as associated events.  
   
 We are looking for high-quality papers related to theoretical advances, novel technologies, and artificial intelligence applications that involve rule-based representation and reasoning.  
 We accept the following submission formats for papers:  
  * Long papers (up to 15 pages in LNCS style including references)  
  * Short papers (up to 8 pages in LNCS style including references)  
  Long papers should present original and significant research and/or development results. Short papers should concisely describe general results or specific applications, systems, or position statements. All submissions must be prepared in Springer's LNCS style  .  
 Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference/workshop with formal proceedings. Double submission to a workshop with informal proceedings is allowed. Papers put on arXiv are also allowed as long as they are not refereed (i.e., formally reviewed by peers). Papers can be submitted using EasyChair  .  
   
 For more information, see https://2023.declarativeai.net/events/ruleml-rr  or contact Raoul Koudijs at raoulxluoar at  gmail.com  .
