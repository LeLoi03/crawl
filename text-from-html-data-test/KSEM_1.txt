 Final Paper  
 Please submit the files including your camera-ready paper and copyright form using your EasyChair author account.  Follow the instructions after the login for uploading two files: (a) either a zipped file containing all your LaTeX sources or a Word file in the RTF format, and (b) PDF version of your camera-ready paper. The page limit is strict. Please follow strictly the author instructions of Springer-Verlag when preparing the final version.  Springer required this conference to list the email address of all authors. Please make sure to list the email boxs of all authors to avoid future revision and delay.  
   
  We encourage the inclusion of ORCIDs in the publication.  For more information see here  .  
   
  Our publisher has recently introduced an extra control loop: once data processing is finished, they will contact all corresponding authors and ask them to check their papers. We expect this to happen shortly before the printing of the proceedings. At that time your quick interaction with Springer-Verlag will be greatly appreciated. Copyright Form  
 Please upload a signed and completed copyright form to us as soon as possible. The Springer copyright forms can be found at HERE   . Please refer to the following picture to fill out the first page of the form.  

  One of the authors must sign the form on behalf of all of the authors of a particular paper, having gained their permission to do so. He or she signs for and accepts responsibility for releasing the material on behalf of any and all co-authors. The corresponding author must be available to check the paper before it is published. Please note that once a paper has been delivered to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the paper cannot be made. Authors' names cannot be added or deleted, their order cannot be changed, and the corresponding author cannot be altered. You should scan the form into PDF or any other standard image format. We greatly appreciate your cooperation in these matters. Thank you again for your contribution to KSEM 2023.
