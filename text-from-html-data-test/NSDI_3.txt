  Exhibitors will have access to the conference food and beverage. Luncheon is only provided on Tuesday. 
  Anyone who is registered to attend sessions (e.g., a staff member with a full conference pass) may also double as an exhibitor. Any exhibitor who would like to attend sessions will not be allowed unless registered as a full attendee with either a sponsor pass or a regular registration.
