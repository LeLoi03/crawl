   CURRENT CONFERENCE  
  CAADRIA 202  5  
  22 — 29 MARCH 2025  
  Tokyo    

  The Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA) promotes teaching and research in CAAD in Asia, and has members on six continents.  
 It organizes an annual conference, the first of which was held in 1996 in Hong Kong. Since then, 20 conferences have been held in Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand. The conferences provide an opportunity for teachers, students, researchers, and practitioners to meet each other and learn about the latest research in the field. The proceedings of the conferences are available both online and in research libraries around the world.  
 CAADRIA was founded with the following objectives:  
 To facilitate the dissemination of information about CAAD among Asian schools of architecture, planning, engineering, and building sciences. 
  To encourage the exchange of staff, students, experience, courseware, and software among schools. 
  To identify research and develop needs in CAAD education and to initiate collaboration to satisfy them. 
  To promote research and teaching in CAAD that enhances creativity rather than production. 
  CAADRIA is one of the four founding organizations of the International Journal of Architectural Computing (IJAC), and supervises one issue each year. IJAC is published by Multi-Science in both paper and electronic versions.
