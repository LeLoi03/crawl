  The Integrated Healthcare Timetabling Competition 2024   
   Submitted by watt  on Mon, 2024-10-07 07:26    
 Building on the success of the earlier timetabling competitions, the Integrated Healthcare Timetabling Competition 2024 intends to stimulate research focusing on the challenges of integrated optimization problems.  
 The considered optimization problem integrates three critical problems in healthcare: surgical case planning, patient admission scheduling and nurse-to-room assignment.

 PATAT 2022  

 Submitted 4 years 10 months ago by Greet  .   

 Event Location:   
 Irish College  Janseniusstraat 1    
 3000  Leuven  Belgium   
   
 See map: Google Maps    

 BE   

 Date:   
 Tuesday, August 30, 2022  to Friday, September 2, 2022    

 Description:   
 The 2020 silver anniversary edition of PATAT was originally intended to be held by KU Leuven in Bruges (Belgium), but had to be postponed until 2022 in light of the pandemic. The conference will now instead be held in the equally beautiful city of Leuven (Belgium)  , the university's home town, and will run from Tuesday 30th August until Friday 2nd September 2022  . The venue will be the Irish College, which promises to offer the perfect setting for researchers and practitioners to reflect, present and discuss on the substantial progress made by the timetabling academic community over the last twenty-seven years as well as to anticipate where we might be headed throughout the coming decades. To complement this historical reflection and anticipation of the future, a range of exciting plenary talks will be given by experts in established areas of timetabling as well as newly emerging ones. We therefore wish to extend a warm invitation to anyone with an interest in timetabling or related problems to participate by submitting a paper by March 23rd 2022  .  
 Some topics of interest for the conference include, but are certainly not limited to, the following: timetabling problems (e.g., educational timetabling, timetabling in transport, employee rostering, sports timetabling, timetabling in healthcare), timetabling algorithms (e.g., mathematical programming, heuristic search, metaheuristics - Evolutionary Computation, Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, Ant Colony Methods, hyper-heuristics, machine learning, matheuristics, constraint-based methods, algorithm portfolios, parallel/distributed computing, multi-objective/multi-criteria approaches), foundational/theoretical studies (e.g. complexity issues), timetabling tools and applications, and any optimization issues related to timetabling.  
 A special track is planned, dedicated to the International Timetabling Competitions on University Course Timetabling (ITC 2019) and Sports Timetabling (ITC 2021)  
 We are pleased to announce that the invited speakers who were confirmed in principle for the 2020 edition have agreed, travel restrictions permitting, to deliver plenary talks at the 2022 edition:  
 Celso C. Ribeiro, Computer Science, Universidade Federal Fluminense, Brazil 
  Sigrid Knust, Institut für Informatik, Universität Osnabrück, Germany 
  Andrea Schaerf, Polytechnic Department of Engineering and Architecture, University of Udine, Italy 
  Deepak Ajwani, School of Computer Science, University College Dublin, Ireland 
  Peter Nightingale, Department of Computer Science, University of York, UK 
  We look forward to welcoming you to Leuven where you will be free to sample some of the finest versions of the very best things life has to offer: Belgian chocolate, beer and fries!
