   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- The 20th International Conference on Mobile Systems and Pervasive Computing (MobiSPC) Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada August 14-16, 2023 http://cs-conferences.acadiau.ca/mobispc-23/  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mobile Systems and Pervasive Computing (MobiSPC) have evolved into an active area of research and development. This is due to the tremendous advances in a broad spectrum of technologies and topics, including wireless networking, mobile and distributed computing, sensor systems RFID technology, and the ubiquitous mobile phone. MobiSPC- solicits papers that focus on the theory, systems, practices and challenges of providing users with a successful mobile or wireless experience. This includes how mobile computing changes how people pervasively use their computers, computing resources and applications, as well the systems services and technologies enabling those applications. MobiSPC-2023 will provide a leading-edge, scholarly forum for researchers, engineers, and students alike to share their state-of-the-art research and developmental work in the broad areas of pervasive computing and mobile systems.
