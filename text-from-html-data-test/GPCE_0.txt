  ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts & Experiences (GPCE) is a venue for researchers and practitioners interested in techniques that use program generation, domain-specific languages, and component deployment to increase programmer productivity, improve software quality, and shorten the time-to-market of software products. In addition to exploring cutting-edge techniques of generative software, our goal is to foster further cross-fertilization between the software engineering and the programming languages research communities.  
 Generative and component approaches and domain-specific abstractions are revolutionizing software development just as automation and componentization revolutionized manufacturing. Raising the level of abstraction in software specification has been a fundamental goal of the computing community for several decades. Key technologies for automating program development and lifting the abstraction level closer to the problem domain are Generative Programming for program synthesis, Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) for compact problem-oriented programming notations, and corresponding Implementation Technologies aiming at modularity, correctness, reuse, and evolution. As the field matures Applications and Empirical Results are of increasing importance.  
 GPCE 2023 will be co-located with SPLASH, SAS, and SLE. The conference will be hosted in Lisbon, Portugal.

 Call for Papers  
  
 The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts & Experiences (GPCE) is a programming languages conference focusing on techniques and tools for code generation, language implementation, and product-line development.  
 New in GPCE 2023   
 This year, GPCE considers the following additional topics of interest:  
 AI/ML techniques for generating code, and 
  low code / no code approaches. 
  Also, GPCE solicits an additional paper category:  
 Generative Pearl: is an elegant essay about generative programming. Examples include but are not limited to an interesting application of generative programming and an elegant presentation of a (new or old) data structure using generative programming (similar to Functional Pearl in ICFP and Pearl in ECOOP). 
  Topics of Interest:   
 GPCE seeks conceptual, theoretical, empirical, and technical contributions to its topics of interest, which include but are not limited to:  
 program transformation, staging, 
  macro systems, preprocessors, 
  program synthesis, 
  code-recommendation systems, 
  domain-specific languages, 
  generative language workbenches, 
  language embedding, language design, 
  feature-oriented programming, 
  domain engineering, 
  feature interactions, 
  applications and properties of code generation, 
  language implementation, 
  product-line development, 
  (NEW!) AI/ML techniques for generating code, and 
  (NEW!) low code / no code approaches. 
  GPCE promotes cross-fertilization between programming languages and software development and among different styles of generative programming in its broadest sense.  
 Authors are welcome to check with the PC chair whether their planned papers are in scope.  
 Paper Categories   
 GPCE solicits four kinds of submissions:  
 Full Papers: reporting original and unpublished results of research that contribute to scientific knowledge for any GPCE topics. Full paper submissions must not exceed 12 pages excluding the bibliography. 
  Short Papers: presenting unconventional ideas or new visions in any GPCE topics. Short papers do not always contain complete results as in the case of full papers, but can introduce new ideas to the community and get early feedback. Note that short papers are not intended to be position statements. Accepted short papers are included in the proceedings and will be presented at the conference. Short paper submissions must not exceed 6 pages excluding the bibliography, and must have the text “(Short Paper)” appended to their titles. 
  Tool Demonstrations: presenting tools for any GPCE topics. Tools must be available for use and must not be purely commercial. Submissions must provide a tool description not exceeding 6 pages excluding bibliography and a separate demonstration outline including screenshots also not exceeding 6 pages. Tool demonstration submissions must have the text “(Tool Demonstration)” appended to their titles. If they are accepted, tool descriptions will be included in the proceedings. The demonstration outline will only be used for evaluating the submission. 
  (NEW!) Generative Pearl: is an elegant essay about generative programming. Examples include but are not limited to an interesting application of generative programming and an elegant presentation of a (new or old) data structure using generative programming (similar to Functional Pearl in ICFP and Pearl in ECOOP). Accepted Generative Pearl papers are included in the proceedings and will be presented at the conference. Generative Pearl submissions must not exceed 12 pages excluding the bibliography (but may be shorter), and must have the text “(Generative Pearl)” appended to their titles. 
  Paper Selection   
 The GPCE program committee will evaluate each submission according to the following selection criteria:  
 Novelty. Papers must present new ideas or evidence and place them appropriately within the context established by previous research in the field. 
  Significance. The results in the paper must have the potential to add to the state of the art or practice in significant ways. 
  Evidence. The paper must present evidence supporting its claims. Examples of evidence include formalizations and proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, and case studies. 
  Clarity. The paper must present its contributions and results clearly. 
  Best Paper Award   
 Following the tradition, the GPCE 2023 program committee will select the best paper among accepted papers. The authors of the best paper will be given the best paper award at the conference.  
 Paper Submission   
 Papers must be submitted using HotCRP: https://gpce23.hotcrp.com/   
 All submissions must use the ACM SIGPLAN Conference Format “acmart”  . Be sure to use the latest LaTeX templates and class files  , the SIGPLAN sub-format, and 10-point font. Consult the sample-sigplan.tex  template and use the document-class \documentclass[sigplan,anonymous,review]{acmart}  .  
 To increase fairness in reviewing, GPCE 2023 uses the double-blind review process  which has become standard across SIGPLAN conferences:  
 Author names, institutions, and acknowledgments should be omitted from submitted papers, and 
  references to the authors’ own work should be in the third person. 
  No other changes are necessary, and authors will not be penalized if reviewers are able to infer authors’ identities in implicit ways.  
 For additional information, clarification, or answers to questions, contact the program chair: amir (dot) shaikhha (at) ed (dot) ac (dot) uk
