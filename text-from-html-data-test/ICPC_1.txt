 Program comprehension is a vital software engineering and maintenance activity. It is necessary to facilitate reuse, inspection, maintenance, reverse engineering, reengineering, migration, and extension of existing software systems. ICPC (formerly IWPC) provides an opportunity for researchers and industry practitioners to present and discuss both the state of the art and the state of the practice in the general area of program comprehension.
