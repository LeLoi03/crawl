 2009  
 This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the International Symposium on Logical Foundations of Computer Science, LFCS 2009, held in Deerfield Beach, Florida, USA in January 2008. The volume presents 31 revised refereed papers carefully selected by the program committee. All current aspects of logic in computer science are addressed, including constructive mathematics and type theory, logical foundations of programming, logical aspects of computational complexity, logic programming and constraints, ...

 Bulletin of the Section of Logic Volume 36:1/2 (2007), pp. 67–78  Andrew Schumann    
 2015  
 In this paper I propose the non-Archimedean multiple-validity. Further, I build an infinite-order predicate logical language in that predicates of various order are considered as fuzzy relations. Such a language can have non-Archimedean valued semantics. For instance, infinite-order predicates can have an interpretation in the set [0, 1] of hyperreal (hyperrational) numbers. Notice that there exists an effectively axiomatizable part of non-Archimedean valued predicate logic, namely the class of higher-order formulas such that all their predicate quantifiers are universal (or existential). There exist various many-valued logical systems (see [9]). However non-Archimedean valued predicate logic has not been constructed yet. The idea of non-Archimedean multiple-validity is that (1) the set of truth values is uncountable infinite and (2) this set isn’t well-ordered. This idea can have a lot of applications in probabilistic reasoning (see [7], [13], [8]). In this paper I show that infini...
