 About NSS 2023  
 While the attack systems have become more easy-to-use, sophisticated, and powerful, interest has greatly increased in the field of building more effective, intelligent, adaptive, active and high performance defense systems which are distributed and networked. The conference will cover research on all theoretical and practical aspects related to network and system security, such as authentication, access control, availability, integrity, privacy, confidentiality, dependability and sustainability of computer networks and systems.  
 Founded in 2007, the aim of the NSS (International Conference on Network and System Security) series  is to provide a leading edge forum to foster interaction between researchers and developers with the network and system security communities, and to give attendees an opportunity to interact with experts in academia, industry, and governments. NSS 2023 is the 17th edition of the International Conference on Network and System Security series, which started in 2007. Previous editions were held in: Fiji (2022)  ; Tianjin, China (2021)  ; Melbourne, Australia (2020)  ; Sapporo, Japan (2019)  ; Hong Kong, China (2018)  ; Helsinki, Finland (2017)  ; Taipei (2016)  ; New York City, USA (2015)  ; Xi'an, China (2014)  ; Madrid, Spain (2013)  ; Wu Yi Shan, China (2012)  ; Milan, Italy (2011)  ; Melbourne, Australia (2010)  ; Gold Coast, Australia (2009)  ; Shanghai, China (2008)  ; and Dalian, China (2007).  
 About SocialSec 2023  
 Social Networks and Big Data have pervaded all aspects of our daily lives. With their unparalleled popularity, social networks have evolved from the platforms for social communication and news dissemination, to indispensable tools for professional networking, social recommendations, marketing, and online content distribution. Social Networks, together with other activities, produce Big Data that is beyond the ability of commonly used computer software and hardware tools to capture, manage, and process within a tolerable elapsed time. It has been widely recognised that security and privacy are the critical challenges for Social Networks and Big Data applications due to their scale, complexity and heterogeneity.  
 SocialSec 2023 is the 9th edition of the International Symposium on Security and Privacy in Social Networks and Big Data series  , which started in 2015. Previous editions were held in Xi'an, China (2022)  ; Fuzhou, China (2021)  ; Tianjin, China (2020)  ; Copenhagen, Denmark (2019)  ; Santa Clara, CA, USA (2018)  ; Melbourne, Australia (2017)  ; Fiji (2016)  ; and Hangzhou, China (2015)  .
