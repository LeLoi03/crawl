 RANLP (Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing)  is one of the most influential and competitive NLP conferences. The event is held biennially and grew out of the International Summer schools “Contemporary topics in Computational Linguistics” which were organised for many years as international training events. Previous RANLP conferences (1995, 1997, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2021 and 2023) featured keynote talks by leading experts in NLP as well as presentations/papers of high quality, rigorously reviewed by a Programme Committee of well-known researchers. After 2009, the papers accepted at RANLP and the associated workshops have been included in the ACL Anthology. The RANLP proceedings are indexed by SCOPUS and DBLP. The Proceedings has its own Scopus SJR, in 2023 it is 0,299. The conference will be preceded by a Summer School on Deep Learning and Large Language Models in NLP as well as 4-6 tutorials on current topics of particular interest and cutting edge technologies. RANLP 2025 will be followed by selected workshops on specialised NLP topics as well as shared tasks. A Student Research Workshop will be held in parallel with the main conference. The Student Research Workshops (now 9 th  edition) have become active discussion fora for young researchers.  
  Expected conference submission deadline: end of April/beginning of May 2025  (please regularly check http://ranlp.org/ranlp2025/   for updated information)
