 Financial Cryptography and Data Security is a major international forum for research, advanced development, education, exploration, and debate regarding information assurance, with a specific focus on commercial contexts. The conference covers all aspects of securing transactions and systems. Original works focusing on both fundamental and applied real-world deployments on all aspects surrounding commerce security are solicited. Submissions need not be exclusively concerned with cryptography. Systems security and interdisciplinary works are particularly encouraged.  
 The goal of the conference is to bring security and cryptography researchers and practitioners together with economists, bankers implementers and policy-makers. Intimate and colourful by tradition the FC program features invited talks, academic presentations technical demonstrations and panel discussions. In addition, several workshops  will be held in conjunction with the FC conference.  

 This conference is organized annually by the International Financial Cryptography Association  . | Program Chairs | Foteini Baldimtsi
