 ALIFE 2023: The International Conference on Artificial Life. Sapporo - Japan, 24th-28th July 2023.     
   
 From sites  .google  .com  -  November 29, 2022 1:01 AM      
          Conference Theme: Ghosts in the machine  
  Artificial life seeks to unravel the mysteries of life and mind, to naturalise the “ghosts in the machine”. What is life? What is the mind? Are these two concepts related?  
 These ghosts are however elusive, and difficult to identify or even just define at times. To try and learn more about the mind, research in artificial life and other related fields has more recently focused on studies of complexity, emergence, agency, autonomy, or information theory. As a results, this has led to major advancements in robotics, synthetic biology and artificial intelligence, among others. The main research programs in these areas however seem to be simply forgetting about the mind, rather than trying to explain it.  
 At the same time, with the advent of new technologies such as brain-machine interface, cyborgization, virtual/augmented reality and the metaverse, the boundaries between agents/living organisms and their environment have began fluctuating. Minds are no longer in our (living organism) shells, expanding beyond current spatial boundaries and into a new form of the "extended mind" hypothesis. At ALIFE 2023, we will bring back the focus to studies of the mind, facing the challenges and embracing the opportunities that come with studies of an often neglected but ever so important concept in both artificial life research and our daily lives.

 Complex thinking and artificial intelligence, Octobe  r 28, 2024, Online     
   
 From ces  .uc  .pt  - September 11, 9:40 PM      
 Workshop | October 28, 2024, 13h00-19h30 (GMT+1), Online  

 Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have also opened new possibilities for Human-AI interaction towards systems of co and augmented intelligence. On the other hand, developments regarding the practice of complex thinking, as a mode of coupling with the world that is organisationally coherent with the properties that organise complex natural and social systems, has been proposed as potentially leading to more effective ecosystemically positive and sustainable possibilities for action. It is hypothesised that more complex modes of thinking may lead to creative and abductive leaps capable of guiding effective interventions and the process of managing change in “real-world” complex systems, in conditions of uncertainty and risk. The CT & AI project will explore possibilities and limits of the interaction of a framework for the practice and promotion of Complex Thinking (CT) with AI tools based on LLMs (e.g. Chat GPT, Gemini). It aimed at developing and evaluating preliminary protocols to guide the integration of methods and tools for promoting CT with the use of AI tools towards generating complex understandings for practice and research. Finally, it aimed at exploring stakeholders (policy-makers, practitioners, scientists/academics) stances regarding the use of AI in relation to CT.

 School on Biological Physics across Scales: Pattern Formation. November 11 – 22, 2024, São Paulo, Brazil     

 From www  .ictp-saifr  .org  - August 8, 8:01 PM      
  
 Systems as different as the cellular cytoskeleton, microbial communities in soil, and savanna landscapes have in common the emergence of patterns: random yet organized spatial structures that form in an otherwise translationally invariant space. These structures emerge due to the local, individual-level interactions of agents – proteins, cells, trees – that, on a larger scale, result in nonlinear dynamics for the density field. Crucial phenomena hinge on the formation of these patterns: mitosis, embryo development, bacterial population survival, ecosystem’s robustness to aridification.  
 While broadly different in scale, these systems can be theoretically described by similar statistical physics frameworks, an approach pioneered by Alan Turing in 1952 and still the focus of very active development. The goal of this school is to bring together experts on these different systems using mathematical modeling, experimental approaches and modern data-driven techniques to engage in an interdisciplinary dialogue about pattern formation in living systems.  
 There is no registration fee and limited funds are available for travel and local expenses.

 Date:  September 30 – October 4, 2024   
   
 Venue:  IFT-UNESP, São Paulo, Brazil   
   
 Active matter describes systems whose constituent elements consume energy locally in order to move or to exert mechanical forces. As such, active matter systems are intrinsically out of thermodynamic equilibrium. Examples include flocks or herds of animals, collections of cells, components of the cellular cytoskeleton and even artificial microswimmers. Active matter is a rapidly growing field involving diverse scientific communities in physics, biology, computational sciences, applied mathematics, chemistry, and engineering. Numerous applications of active matter are constantly arising in biological systems, smart materials, precision medicine, and robotics.  
   
  This school is intended for graduate students and researchers interested in the physics of active matter. The lectures will cover well-tested and successful theoretical approaches as well as a discussion of experimental results. To achieve this purpose, leading experts will present lectures on fundamental aspects of active matter and a pedagogical exposition of its recent trends.  
   
  Applicants are invited to submit abstracts for poster presentations.  
   
  There is no registration fee and limited funds are available for travel and local expenses.   

 Lecturers:    
 Julia M Yeomans | (University of Oxford, UK): | From Active Nematics to Mechanobiology 
  Rodrigo Soto | (Universidad de Chile, Chile): | Computational Modeling of Active Systems 
  Aparna Baskaran | (Brandeis University, USA): | Theoretical Foundations of Active Matter: Lessons from Ideal Microscopic Models

 Eleventh International Conference on Guided Self-Organization (GSO-2025)     

 From www  .guided-self  .org  - May 29, 12:12 AM      
 ​"Guided Self-Organization: Machine Learning in Embodied Agents"  
  The 11th International Conference on Guided Self-Organization takes place during 12-14 February 2025 in Tübingen, Germany. GSO-2025 is organized by The University of Tübingen, The Hamburg University of Technology, The Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, and The International Association for Guided Self-Organization (TIA-GSO).  
  Research Aims and Topics  
  The goal of Guided Self-Organization (GSO) is to leverage the strengths of self-organization (simplicity, parallelization, adaptability, robustness, scalability) while still being able to direct the outcome of the self-organizing process. GSO typically has the following features: (i) an increase in organization (structure and/or functionality) over some time; (ii) the local interactions are not explicitly guided by any external agent; (iii) task-independent objectives are combined with task-dependent constraints.  
 GSO "aims to regulate self-organization for specific purposes, so that a dynamical system may reach specific attractors or outcomes. The regulation constrains a self-organizing process within a complex system by restricting local interactions between the system components, rather than following an explicit control mechanism or a global design blueprint." Information theory, nonlinear dynamics and network theory are core to many of these methods, and quantifying complexity, its sources and effects is a common theme.  
  ​  
  The GSO-2025 conference will bring together invited experts and researchers in machine learning, artificial life, self-organizing systems, and complex adaptive systems, with particular emphasis on autonomous agents, information theory, critical phenomena and emergent behaviour. Special topics of interest include: reinforcement learning, intrinsic motivations, origin of life, systems biology, physics of life, unconventional computation, swarm intelligence, measures of complexity, criticality, complex networks, information-driven self-organization (IDSO), etc.  
 The program includes three days, with five keynote talks, and a number of regular onsite presentations on each day. There are no registration fees for the conference.

 ICTP – SAIFR » School on Water: From the Anomalies to the Biological and Technological Applications     

 From www  .ictp-saifr  .org  - May 9, 5:49 AM      
 School on Water: From the Anomalies to the Biological and Technological Applications    
   
 Date:  September 2 – 7, 2024   
   
 Venue:  IFT-UNESP, São Paulo, Brazil   
   
 We can all agree that a liquid that occupies 70 percent of Earth’s surface and two-thirds of our body is very important. Do we already know everything about water? Water has more than 70 thermodynamic, dynamic and structural anomalies and also shows new strange behavior upon analysis of the biological or material nanostructures. For instance, at nanoconfinement, water violates the hydrodynamic equations. Since water is present everywhere, understanding how the anomalies affect different systems is relevant. In this school, we explore the water anomalies starting from the basic ideas of phase transitions and critical phenomena, and show how they can be measured from scattering experiments and simulations of the nanoscale results.  
   
  There is no registration fee and limited funds are available for travel and local expenses.   

 Lecturers:    
 Gustavo Appignanesi | (Universidad Nacional del Sur, Argentina): | Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Surfaces and Interfaces 
  Marcia Barbosa | (UFRGS, Brazil): | Nanoconfined Water 
  Paola Gallo | (Roma Tre University, Italy): | Dynamics and Supercooled Water

 Workshop: Demystifying machine learning for population researchers. November 5-6, Rostock, Germany     
   
 From www  .demogr  .mpg  .de  - April 30, 9:51 PM      
 Advances in computational power and statistical algorithms, in conjunction with the increasing availability of large datasets, have led to a Cambrian explosion of machine learning (ML) methods. For population researchers, these methods are useful not only for predicting population dynamics but also as tools to improve causal inference tasks. However, the rapid evolution of this literature, coupled with terminological disparities from conventional approaches, renders these methods enigmatic and arduous for many population researchers to grasp.  
 This workshop on November 5 to 6, 2024 at the Max Planck Intsitute for Demographic Research (MPIDR) in Rostock, Germany, clarifies the goals, techniques, and applications of machine learning methods for population research. The workshop covers  
 an introduction to ML methods for population researchers, 
  showcases of ML applications to answer causal questions, 
  discussions of the current developments of ML for population health, fertility and family dynamics, and 
  fosters critical discussions about the shortfalls of these techniques. 
  The main focus of this workshop is on ML techniques using quantitative population data and research questions, not on ML language models. The workshop consists of keynotes, contributed sessions, and a tutorial.

 School on Modelling Infectious Disease Dynamics. May 6 – 12, 2024. São Paulo, Brazil     

 From www  .ictp-saifr  .org  - February 27, 11:02 PM      
  
 The recent COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the power of modeling to support policymaking. However, most South American countries lack capacity in the field of modeling. This seven-day school will address how modeling allows us to use the health resources we currently have more efficiently, increasing their impact, improving people’s well-being, and saving lives as a result. The school includes a course on epidemic models, on numerical treatment of models and on epidemiological data analysis, and will be focused on group work involving “hands-on” modeling challenges. There will be classes in the morning and group projects in the afternoon. Participants from all areas related to the subject are welcome to apply. Knowledge of basic differential calculus is required.

 ICTP – SAIFR » Minicourse on Bayesian Machine Learning for Scientific Research     

 From www  .ictp-saifr  .org  - September 11, 9:42 PM      
  
 October 28 – November 1, 2024  
 São Paulo, Brazil  
 ICTP-SAIFR/IFT-UNESP  

 We will present five 3-hour lectures that will introduce participants to the world of Bayesian Machine Learning for scientific purposes. The minicourse is tailored to suit both senior and junior researchers, catering to their respective levels of experience and interest.  
   
  In the first block of each lecture, we aim to transmit the big picture of the lecture’s topic with a focus on the details from a supervising point of view. The fine points and subtleties will be addressed here, but without strict demonstrations or supplied code. This block is intended for both seniors and juniors: for seniors as a summary that shows how to apply these tools to scientific research; and for juniors as an entrance to the second block in which we put our hands in the dough. We conclude the block with an extended coffee break where we expect that the proposed ideas trigger discussions around each participant’s field of study and how to apply it in their data.  
   
  The second block is very hands-on and is intended for juniors, but seniors interested in getting actively involved in the calculations are welcome as well. We present, discuss and write code. Participants are engaged in coding exercises and discussing practical applications. This block emphasizes practical skills and real-world problem-solving. We use different libraries, and we deploy statistical software especially designed to tackle the presented problems  
   
  The minicourse is generally designed for any scientific career. We use mostly physics examples, but the material will be useful and insightful for any other field with hard scientific research. We will try to adapt and discuss the problems within the participants’ fields of research.  
   
  Participants are expected to have taken courses in algebra and analysis, be familiar with multi-dimensional vectors and expressions, have some knowledge of probability and statistics, and be prepared for non-trivial abstract reasoning and thinking. Juniors, in addition, are expected to have some knowledge of Python.  
   
  There is no registration fee and limited funds are available for local expenses.

 Lake Como School on Computational Social Science: Advances, Challenges and Opportunities     

 From css  .lakecomoschool  .org  - February 5, 10:23 AM      
  
 May 13-17, 2024 Villa del Grumello, Como, Italy  
 Over the past decade, computational social science (CSS) has risen as an interdisciplinary field that combines methods and theories from computer science, statistics, and social sciences to study complex social phenomena using computational tools and techniques.   

 By leveraging the power of computing and data, computational social scientists aim to uncover patterns and trends in complex social systems that may be difficult or impossible to discern through traditional research methods.   

 Topics of interest include social networks, online communities, opinion dynamics, and collective decision-making, among others. Computational social science has become increasingly important as our world becomes more digitised, and its insights have significant implications for fields such as public policy, marketing, and sociology.   

 The First edition of the school  Computational Social Science: Advances, Challenges and Opportunities  is designed to provide an intensive and immersive learning experience for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and early career faculty interested in utilising computational methods to study social phenomena.   
 The school will be open to  45 selected students.  Application deadline: February 25th  , 2024
