 Overview  
 Top Research Topics at Computational Intelligence and Games?  
 Artificial intelligence (52.39%) 
  Machine learning (20.46%) 
  Computational intelligence (11.57%) 
  The conference investigates areas of study like Artificial intelligence, Machine learning, Computational intelligence, Human–computer interaction and Evolutionary computation. Topics in Artificial intelligence explored in Computational Intelligence and Games were investigated in conjunction with research in Monte Carlo tree search and Game theory. Monte Carlo method and Tree (data structure) are the foundational disciplines used for the Monte Carlo tree search research featured in the event.  
 The event explores research in Machine learning and the adjacent study of Video game. Many of the studies tackled connect Evolutionary computation with a similar field of study like Evolutionary algorithm. While the event focused on Game mechanics, it was also able to explore topics like Game design and Combinatorial game theory.  
 The presented Game design research focuses mostly on Non-cooperative game and, on occasion, topics in Repeated game. The majority of Repeated game studies are focused on the issues of Simultaneous game. Combinatorial game theory research presented falls under the umbrella topic of Sequential game.  
 What are the most cited papers published at the conference?  
 ViZDoom: A Doom-based AI research platform for visual reinforcement learning (307 citations) 
  Towards automatic personalised content creation for racing games (243 citations) 
  Player modeling using self-organization in Tomb Raider: Underworld (215 citations) 
  Research areas of the most cited articles at Computational Intelligence and Games:  
 The conference papers tackle a plethora of topics, such as Artificial intelligence, Machine learning, Human–computer interaction, Computational intelligence and Game design. The published papers tackle studies in Video game and the interrelated subject of Monte Carlo tree search to gain insights into Artificial intelligence. Issues in Game design were discussed in the most cited publications, taking into consideration concepts from other disciplines like Game mechanics and Non-cooperative game.  
 Papers citation over time  
 A key indicator for each conference is its effectiveness in reaching other researchers with the papers published at that venue.  
 The chart below presents the interquartile range (first quartile 25%, median 50% and third quartile 75%) of the number of citations of articles over time.

 Publication chance based on affiliation  
 The publication chance index shows the ratio of articles published by the best research institutions at the conference edition to all articles published within that conference. The best research institutions were selected based on the largest number of articles published during all editions of the conference.  
 The chart below presents the percentage ratio of articles from top institutions (based on their ranking of total papers).Top affiliations were grouped by their rank into the following tiers: top 1-10, top 11-20, top 21-50, and top 51+. Only articles with a recognized affiliation are considered.  

 Research.com  

 During the most recent 2016 edition, 5.32%  of publications had an unrecognized affiliation. Out of the publications with recognized affiliations, 24.72%  were posted by at least one author from the top 10 institutions publishing at the conference. Another 15.73%  included authors affiliated with research institutions from the top 11-20 affiliations. Institutions from the 21-50 range included 20.22%  of all publications and 39.33%  were from other institutions.  
 Returning Authors Index  
 A very common phenomenon observed among researchers publishing scientific articles is the intentional selection of conferences they have already attended in the past. In particular, it is worth analyzing the case when the authors participate in the same conference from year to year.  
 The Returning Authors Index presented below illustrates the ratio of authors who participated in both a given as well as the previous edition of the conference in relation to all participants in a given year.

 Returning Institution Index  
 The graph below shows the Returning Institution Index, illustrating the ratio of institutions that participated in both a given and the previous edition of the conference in relation to all affiliations present in a given year.

 The experience to innovation index  
 Our experience to innovation index was created to show a cross-section of the experience level of authors publishing at a conference. The index includes the authors publishing at the last edition of a conference  , grouped by total number of publications throughout their academic career (P) and the total number of citations of these publications ever received (C).  
 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups:  
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25), 
  Competent - P < 10 or C < 100 (the number of publications less than 10 or the number of citations less than 100), 
  Experienced - P < 25 or C < 625 (the number of publications less than 25 or the number of citations less than 625), 
  Master - P < 50 or C < 2500 (the number of publications less than 50 or the number of citations less than 2500), 
  Star - P ≥ 50 and C ≥ 2500 (both the number of publications greater than 50 and the number of citations greater than 2500). 

 The chart below illustrates experience levels of first authors in cases of publications with multiple authors.
