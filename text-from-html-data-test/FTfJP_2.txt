 Mon 16 - Fri 20 September 2024 Vienna, Austria  FTfJP 2024  with ISSTA/ECOOP 2024    
 Formal techniques can help analyse programs, precisely describe program behaviour, and verify program properties. Modern programming languages are interesting targets for formal techniques due to their ubiquity and wide user base, stable and well-defined interfaces and platforms, and powerful (but also complex) libraries. New languages and applications in this space are continually arising, resulting in new progr ...

 Sun 18 - Fri 23 June 2017 Barcelona, Spain  FTfJP 2017  with ECOOP 2017    
 FTfJP is an established workshop, running annually since 1999 alongside ECOOP. Its goal is to bring together people working on formal techniques and tool support for Java, or closely related languages such as C# or Scala, either with the aim to describe, analyse, and verify aspects and properties of these programming languages themselves (type systems, semantics, bytecode verification, etc.), or of programs writt ...
