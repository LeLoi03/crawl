   Conference Call for Papers  
 The Sixteenth International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interaction, ACHI 2023, was proposed as a result of a paradigm shift in the most recent achievements and future trends in human interactions with increasingly complex systems. Adaptive and knowledge-based user interfaces, universal accessibility, human-robot interaction, agent-driven human computer interaction, and sharable mobile devices are a few of these trends. ACHI 2023 also brings a suite of specific domain applications, such as gaming, e-learning, social, medicine, teleconferencing and engineering.  
   
  ACHI 2023 continues a series of events targeting traditional and advanced paradigms for computer-human interaction in multi-technology environments. The conference covers also fundamentals on interfaces and models, and highlights new challenging industrial applications and research topics.  
   
  We solicit both academic, research, and industrial contributions. We welcome technical papers presenting research and practical results, position papers addressing the pros and cons of specific proposals, such as those being discussed in the standard fora or in industry consortia, survey papers addressing the key problems and solutions on any of the above topics short papers on work in progress, and panel proposals.  
   
  Industrial presentations are not subject to the format and content constraints of regular submissions. We expect short and long presentations that express industrial position and status.  
   
  Tutorials on specific related topics and panels on challenging areas are encouraged.  
   
  The topics suggested by the conference can be discussed in term of concepts, state of the art, research, standards, implementations, running experiments, applications, and industrial case studies. Authors are invited to submit complete unpublished papers, which are not under review in any other conference or journal in the following, but not limited to, topic areas.   
 Overview  
 Top Research Topics at Advances in Computer-Human Interaction?  
 Human–computer interaction (38.85%) 
  Artificial intelligence (13.31%) 
  Multimedia (12.85%) 
  Human–computer interaction, Artificial intelligence, Multimedia, Usability and Simulation are among the topics commonly tackled in Advances in Computer-Human Interaction. Topics in Human–computer interaction explored in the conference were investigated in conjunction with research in Context (language use), User interface, Task (project management) and Robot. Human–robot interaction is a focus of the presented Robot works and it dives deep in Human–robot interaction.  
 The concepts on Artificial intelligence presented in it can also apply to other research fields, including Computer vision and Natural language processing. The conference focused on Multimedia research but expanded to cover World Wide Web. In particular, the Usability works presented emphasize discussions on Usability engineering.  
 The event emphasizes research on Simulation, which includes concerns such as Haptic technology.  
 What are the most cited papers published at the conference?  
 From Isolation to Communication: A Case Study Evaluation of Robot Assisted Play for Children with Autism with a Minimally Expressive Humanoid Robot (237 citations) 
  Towards Deeper Understanding of Persuasion in Software and Information Systems (130 citations) 
  Understanding Social Robots (103 citations) 
  Research areas of the most cited articles at Advances in Computer-Human Interaction:  
 The conference publications cover a variety of subjects, including Human–computer interaction, Artificial intelligence, Robot, Multimedia and Knowledge management. The conference articles aim to investigate interdisciplinary topics such as Human–computer interaction and User group. Task (project management) and Computer vision are some topics wherein Artificial intelligence research discussed in the most cited publications has an impact.  
 What topics the last edition of the conference is best known for?  
 Artificial intelligence 
  Operating system 
  The Internet 
  The previous edition focused in particular on these issues:  
 Advances in Computer-Human Interaction primarily focuses on research topics in Human–computer interaction, Artificial intelligence, Robot, Usability and Multimedia. Human–computer interaction research in the conference involves the investigation of Context (language use) studies, all of which are linked to disciplines such as Gesture. The Artificial intelligence research presented in it explores the relationship between Computer vision and the closely related topic of Haptic technology.  
 Most of the works presented in the conference deals with Robot but it intersects with the subject of Simulation. The Usability research presented in Advances in Computer-Human Interaction explores the relationship between Software engineering and the closely related topic of Software development process and Software. The studies tackled, which mainly focus on Human–robot interaction, apply to Humanoid robot as well.  
 The most cited articles from the last conference are:  
 From Isolation to Communication: A Case Study Evaluation of Robot Assisted Play for Children with Autism with a Minimally Expressive Humanoid Robot (237 citations) 
  Understanding Social Robots (103 citations) 
  Evaluating the Usability of Transactional Web Sites (39 citations) 
  Papers citation over time  
 A key indicator for each conference is its effectiveness in reaching other researchers with the papers published at that venue.  
 The chart below presents the interquartile range (first quartile 25%, median 50% and third quartile 75%) of the number of citations of articles over time.

 Publication chance based on affiliation  
 The publication chance index shows the ratio of articles published by the best research institutions at the conference edition to all articles published within that conference. The best research institutions were selected based on the largest number of articles published during all editions of the conference.  
 The chart below presents the percentage ratio of articles from top institutions (based on their ranking of total papers).Top affiliations were grouped by their rank into the following tiers: top 1-10, top 11-20, top 21-50, and top 51+. Only articles with a recognized affiliation are considered.  

 Research.com  

 During the most recent 2019 edition, 14.29%  of publications had an unrecognized affiliation. Out of the publications with recognized affiliations, 16.67%  were posted by at least one author from the top 10 institutions publishing at the conference. Another 0.00%  included authors affiliated with research institutions from the top 11-20 affiliations. Institutions from the 21-50 range included 16.67%  of all publications and 66.67%  were from other institutions.  
 Returning Authors Index  
 A very common phenomenon observed among researchers publishing scientific articles is the intentional selection of conferences they have already attended in the past. In particular, it is worth analyzing the case when the authors participate in the same conference from year to year.  
 The Returning Authors Index presented below illustrates the ratio of authors who participated in both a given as well as the previous edition of the conference in relation to all participants in a given year.

 The experience to innovation index  
 Our experience to innovation index was created to show a cross-section of the experience level of authors publishing at a conference. The index includes the authors publishing at the last edition of a conference  , grouped by total number of publications throughout their academic career (P) and the total number of citations of these publications ever received (C).  
 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups:  
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25), 
  Competent - P < 10 or C < 100 (the number of publications less than 10 or the number of citations less than 100), 
  Experienced - P < 25 or C < 625 (the number of publications less than 25 or the number of citations less than 625), 
  Master - P < 50 or C < 2500 (the number of publications less than 50 or the number of citations less than 2500), 
  Star - P ≥ 50 and C ≥ 2500 (both the number of publications greater than 50 and the number of citations greater than 2500). 

 The chart below illustrates experience levels of first authors in cases of publications with multiple authors.
