  [ Full Papers  | Adjunct Proceedings  ]  
  Please find the pre-recorded videos from all tracks in the SIGCHI YouTube channel [tba].  
  Conference Schedule  Please note this is a tentative schedule – slight changes and additions to the program may take place as we near the conference dates.  
  However, authors and presenters of full papers (paper sessions) are advised that their scheduling is fixed and will not change.  
   
  Late-Breaking Work and Demo authors are expected to be near their posters/demos during the morning break and in the dedicated poster & demo session (Thursday 28th 16:30-17.30). During these times, remote LBW/Demo presenters should also connect to the remote participation platforms (Zoom, Discord) and be available for Q&A.  
  
 To support your conference experience, the program can also be found on the SIGCHI online app  (desktop and mobile).
