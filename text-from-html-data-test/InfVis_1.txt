 Abstract  
   
 Participation in European Union research projects now requires the setting-up of a project Web site. This paper discusses the creation of the "Matrix" to facilitate the information visualisation of a project; experiments, data, and results, etc, i.e. information far beyond the promotional details of the Web site. The paper describes the theory of such an endeavour before proceeding to discuss the practical realities for this case study project. Finally, we consider any lessons that can be learnt from this real-world application.

 ... According to Luce, Lindzey, Herrnstein, and Atkinson (1988), when information is repeatedly transferred between the short-term and long-term memory systems, the biological processing system's perception of a visual text is translated into linguistic information in the short-term memory, which then yields meaning. The effort can potentially be distributed more equitably among the perceptual, attentive, and cognitive processes via representational graphics (Graham, 2005)  . ...

 In contemporary instructional programs for teaching English as Foreign Language (EFL) all over the world, the application of infographics has become essential for improving students' language skills, in particular reading and writing skills. In many countries worldwide, students have been encouraged through the use of infographics in their English language courses to achieve a high level of proficiency and become competent language learners. This research study aims to examine the influence of integrating infographics into the EFL reading and writing courses. To achieve this aim, the research study focuses on a systematic literature review by investigating 21 papers in the field of teaching EFL. Since students are allowed to use only English for communication in class, it appears to many students as a difficult language to learn. The findings of the literature survey indicate that one of the main obstacles to learning a foreign language seems to be the learners' native language, which must also be considered in organizing foreign language teaching curricula. Another obstacle is that learners have limited opportunities to use their English in reading and writing skills outside the classroom.

 The need to evaluate Information Visualization (InfoVis) systems, just as other information systems (IS), cannot be overestimated. In its case, evaluating InfoVis has proved to be more challenging, because many of the previous evaluation studies have been on user interface of IS generally, with few attending to the peculiarities of InfoVis. The few InfoVis evaluations recorded have been mainly on its perceptual function through its interface evaluation, and others on its cognitive support through the knowledge discovery process. Evaluating InfoVis decision support effectiveness has been sparingly attended to. This experience is argued to be caused by insufficient explicit evaluation methods for InfoVis' associated abstract concepts –decision support as an example. This paper uses an unobtrusive research method involving thematic analysis of InfoVis-related theoretical literatures to characterize and categorize the InfoVis evaluation theories. The result presents perceptual, cognitive and decision supports as InfoVis evaluation paradigms. The theoretical characterization posited that these supports are sequential and of dependent phases. Finally, based on the theoretical argument and the findings, an evaluation framework for InfoVis' decision support effectiveness is proposed, and the process of its experimental evaluation is suggested.

 Making the Unseen Visible    
   
 Chapter    
 Jan 2014 

 Anna Ursyn 
    
 Themes and examples examined in this chapter discuss the fast growing field of visualization. First, basic terms: data, information, knowledge, dimensions, and variables are discussed before going into the visualization issues. The next part of the text overviews some of the basics in visualization techniques: data-, information-, and knowledge-visualization, and tells about tools and techniques used in visualization such as data mining, clusters and biclustering, concept mapping, knowledge maps, network visualization, Web-search result visualization, open source intelligence, visualization of the Semantic Web, visual analytics, and tag cloud visualization. This is followed by some remarks on music visualization. The next part of the chapter is about the meaning and the role of visualization in various kinds of presentations. Discussion relates to concept visualization in visual learning, visualization in education, collaborative visualization, professions that employ visualization skills, and well-known examples of visualization that progress science. Comments on cultural heritage knowledge visualization conclude the chapter.

 "Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to analyse the way in which the insurance industry is facing the renewal of its regulatory framework with respect to the levels of solvency that insurance entities should maintain. This paper also addresses how technological initiatives in general, and the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL), in particular, are making a key contribution to the process of adaptation to the new regulation. Design/methodology/approach – The paper analyses the particular advantages that the application of the XBRL standard can offer in this process, and highlight new lines for further research. Findings – After analysing the current situation of the insurance industry, the paper concludes that technological systems, such as XBRL, are necessary to support the consolidation of financial information, and to ensure the digital transparency of the insurer organisations that are engaged in this new regulatory challenge.

 Insights Into Central And Eastern European Countries Competitiveness: On The Exposure Of Capital Markets To Exchange Rate Risk

 Unexpected fluctuations in exchange rates represent a matter of concern for all businesses nowadays as the volatility in exchange rates impacts businesses’ cash flows, revenues and expenses, and eventually is reflected in the company’s risk-return profile. Companies’ exposures to exchange rate risk have considerably increased in the past decades, given the boost in international operations and the continuous diversification of businesses’ activities at the global level. Despite the attention that businesses display to nominal exchange rates changes, it is the real exchange rate that should be of more concern to corporate managers, since they induce changes at the level of the competitiveness of the business. Our paper comparatively analyzes the exposure to changes in the nominal and real exchanges rates of the local currencies that companies from a number of four Central and Eastern European countries (Romania, Hungary, Czech Republic and Poland) and investigates the nature of the relationship between stock market performance and exchange rates in the four countries under consideration. We find limited evidence for contemporaneous and asymmetric exposure to nominal and real exchange rate risk in all four countries, but consistent evidence for three to four months lagged exposure.

 Purpose: To determine the evaluative criteria used when choosing small-package transportation companies, the level of importance of selected criteria, and how selected package carriers are perceived by small business decision makers. Methodology: Data were collected via self-administered questionnaires from a total of 31 decision makers in small businesses. The self-administered questionnaire was designed with four sections that handled separate but related topics. Questions from all four sections were taken from Parcel Shipping and Distribution’s Best Practice Survey (2006), located at www.psdmag.com/bpsurvey. asp. Results: Findings suggested that on-time delivery was the most salient evaluative criterion used by respondents. Surcharges were the least important criteria when selecting a small package transportation company. Even though, on-time delivery was ranked the highest by all job functions, office managers felt it was second to price/rates. Research/Practical Implications: First is the recognition that package shipping appears to have become more of a commodity service. Even though on-time delivery and reliability of service were considered most important, price/rates were the most important criteria for office managers. For that reason, marketers, when targeting this group must focus efforts towards bottom line cost savings, in essence, justifying the price. When targeting CEOs, presidents, CFOs, accounting personnel, directors of transportation, and shipping managers, marketers should focus efforts on the benefits of on-time delivery and reliability. In other words, “on-time delivery” seems to be the motivating factor for favoring one carrier over another in an acceptable price/rate level.

 Principles of Information Visualization for Business Research

 Ioan I Andone 
    
 In the era of data-centric-science, a large number of visualization tools have been created to help researchers understand increasingly rich business databases. Information visualization is a process of constructing a visual presentation of business quantitative data, especially prepared for managerial use. Interactive information visualization provide researchers with remarkable tools for discovery and innovation. By combining powerful data mining methods with user-controlled interfaces, users are beginning to benefit from these potent telescopes for high-dimensional spaces. They can begin with an overview, zoom in on areas of interest, filter out unwanted items, and then click for details-on-demand. With careful design and efficient algorithms, the dynamic queries approach to data exploration can provide 100 msec updates even for million-record databases. Visualizations of business information are therefore widely used in actually business decision support systems, and by business researchers also. Visual user interfaces called dashboards are tools for reporting the status of a company and its business environment to facilitate business intelligence and performance management activities. In this study, we examine the research on concepts, and the principles of business information visualization, because we hope to be using correctly by business Ph.D. students in their researches. Visual representations are likely to improve business managers, and business researchers efficiency, offer new insights, and encouraging comparisons.

 The Neoliberal Challenge: Between The Scientific Sophism And The Communicative Fascination    
   
 Article    
 Nov 2008 

 José Ramón García Menendez 
    
 Narrations - even those about current phenomena and trends- require a minimum expositive structure, so that they acquire a sufficient degree of intelligibility. That is a difficult attribute when it is dealt with politico-economic processes with the added pretense of remembering past facts and also learning the lessons of History. However, the conventional “introduction–exposition-denouement” sequence recommended by Aristotle in the Poetic as the ideal order of a tale does not allow to delimit the nature and implications of the neoliberal offensive narratively in the peripheral capitalism. In this way, the proposal of F. Kermode for a textual analysis through the road “beginning-end-potentiality” makes operative the analysis of the challenges posed by the current return of neoliberalism and it overcomes the descriptive limitations of the Aristotelian method when it is dealt with the characterization and implications both of a politico-economic program of capitalist depth and the economic philosophy that underlies in such a project. Especially, this is true of the current of thought of the most genuine liberal tradition whose practice defers - in the developing economies that make up the successive peripheral rings of the contemporary capitalism- those socio-economic ingredients that could respond to objectives of social emancipation.

 Most designers know that yellow text presented against a blue background reads clearly and easily, but how many can explain why, and what really are the best ways to help others and ourselves clearly see key patterns in a bunch of data? This book explores the art and science of why we see objects the way we do. Based on the science of perception and vision, the author presents the key principles at work for a wide range of applications--resulting in visualization of improved clarity, utility, and persuasiveness. The book offers practical guidelines that can be applied by anyone: interaction designers, graphic designers of all kinds (including web designers), data miners, and financial analysts.

 Since the beginning of the computer age, researchers from many disciplines have sought to facilitate people's use of computers and to provide ways for scientists to make sense of the immense quantities of data coming out of them. One gainful result of these efforts has been the field of information visualization, whose technology is increasingly applied in scientific research, digital libraries, data mining, financial data analysis, market studies, manufacturing production control, and data discovery.This book collects 38 of the key papers on information visualization from a leading and prominent research lab, the University of Marylandâs Human-Computer Interaction Lab (HCIL). Celebrating HCILâs 20th anniversary, this book presents a coherent body of work from a respected community that has had many success stories with its research and commercial spin-offs. Each chapter contains an introduction specifically written for this volume by two leading HCI researchers, to describe the connections among those papers and reveal HCILs individual approach to developing innovations.

 Many people and institutions possess considerable volumes of data which may 'hide' some fundamental relation which could be exploited to advantage: estate agents, banks, medical researchers, fraud investigators and many others would like to be able to view some graphical presentation of that data and perhaps interact with it and, at some point, be able to say "Ah Ha! Now that is interesting!" That is what Information Visualization is all about: it is the process of forming a mental model of data, thereby supporting insight into that data.
