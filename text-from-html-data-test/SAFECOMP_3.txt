 Workshop proposal submission : 5 February 2023   
  Abstract submission: 6 February 2023   
  Full paper submission: 13 February 2023  
  Notification of acceptance: 22 April 2023  
  Camera-ready submission: 1 June 2023  
 Topics and Application Domains:   
 The conference covers all aspects related to the development, assessment, operation and maintenance of safety-related and safety-critical computer systems. Topics include, but are not limited to:  
   * Fault-tolerant and resilient hardware and software architectures  
  * Fault detection and recovery mechanisms  
  * Distributed and real-time monitoring and control  
  * Security and privacy protection mechanisms for safety applications  
  * Safety/security risk assessment  
  * Model-based analysis, design, and assessment  
  * Formal methods for verification, validation, and fault tolerance  
  * Probabilistic verification and validation  
  * In-the-loop and model-based testing  
  * Validation and verification methodologies and tools  
  * Methods for qualification, assurance and certification  
  * Compositional verification and certification  
  * Architecture-driven assurance of safety and security  
  * Dependability analysis using simulation and experimental measurement  
  * Cyber-physical threats and vulnerability analysis  
  * Safety guidelines, standards and certification  
  * Safety and security interactions and tradeoffs  
  * Safety and security cases  
  * Multi-concern dependability assurance and standardization  
  * Safety-related application of technology trends (e.g. AI, Edge and cloud computing, Digital twin, 5G and 6G, Big data analytics, IoT and IIoT)  
 Domains of application include (but are not limited to):  
   * Railways, automotive, space, avionics, nuclear and process industries  
  * Autonomous systems, advanced robotics, construction engines and off-road vehicles  
  * Telecommunication and networks

  * Logistics, industrial automation, off-shore technology  
 More about SAFECOMP  
 SAFECOMP was established in 1979 by the European Workshop on Industrial Computer Systems, Technical Committee 7 on Reliability, Safety and Security (EWICS TC7). Since then, it has contributed to the progress of the state-of-the-art in dependable application of computers in safety-related and safety-critical systems.  
 SAFECOMP is an annual event covering the state-of-the-art, experience and new trends in the areas of safety, security and reliability of critical computer applications.  
 SAFECOMP provides ample opportunity to exchange insights and experience on emerging methods, approaches and practical solutions. It is a single track conference without parallel sessions, allowing easy networking.
