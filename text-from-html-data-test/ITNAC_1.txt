 Optical Communications  
 Optical communication technologies will continue to be increasingly important in supporting the future Internet's expected scaling requirements of billions of users, their IT needs and aggregated huge bandwidths. Over the last two decades, optical communication technologies have increased the transmission capacity per fiber by several orders of magnitude, achieving Tbit/s transmissions. If the data traffic usage continues to increase at the current rate, a further increase in the transmission capacity of several orders of magnitude will be needed over the coming decades. This implies that future optical systems and networks should be able to support capacities well over Peta bit/s. However, the current technologies have already begun to reveal several fundamental limits; the electronic speed limit, the Shannon and quantum limit, and the IP  bottleneck. The future technologies must overcome these limits ensuring sustainable growth of network traffic. The optical communications theme aims to provide a forum for the presentation and discussion of significant progress of research, development and applications of cutting-edge technologies in optical communication devices, subsystems, systems and networks.
