 Call for paper for the DAM special issue dedicated to ISCO 2022     
  
 ISCO (International Symposium on C  ombinatorial Optimization)  is a biennial symposium whose aim is to bring together researchers from all the communities related to combinatorial optimization, including algorithms and complexity, mathematical programming, operations research, optimization under uncertainty, graphs and combinatorics. It is intended to be a forum for presenting original research in these areas and especially in their intersections. Quality papers on all aspects of combinatorial optimization, from mathematical foundations and theory of algorithms to computational studies and practical applications, are solicited.    
 The first issue of ISCO was held in Hammamet, Tunisia in March 2010, its second one in Athens, Greece in April 2012, i  ts third  o  ne in Lisbon, Portugal in March 2014, its fourth one in Vietri, Italy in May 2016, its fifth one in Marrakesh, Morocco in April 2018. Originally, t he sixth ISCO conference  was to be held at HEC Montreal and the University of Montreal, Canada, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic the conference was held online focusing on long papers.    
 This seventh issue will be held online.   
    
 ISCO 2022 conference will be preceded by a Spring School  which is dedicated to PhD students but the lectures are also open to other colleagues.  
  Lecturer:  Giacomo Nannicini  , Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY USA  
  Topic:  Mathematical Optimization and Quantum Algorithms
