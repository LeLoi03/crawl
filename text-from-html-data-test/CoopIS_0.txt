 About CoopIS  
 Cooperative Information Systems (CIS) facilitate the cooperation between individuals, organisations, smart devices, and systems of systems, by providing flexible, scalable and intelligent services to enterprises, public institutions and user communities. As a result, people and smart devices can interact, share information and work together across physical barriers. The domain of CIS integrates research results from different related computing areas, such as: distributed systems, coordination technologies, collaborative decision making, enterprise architecture, business process management and conceptual modelling.  
   
  In recent years, several innovative technologies have emerged: Cloud Computing, Service Oriented Computing, the Internet of Things, Linked Open Data, Semantic Systems, Collective Awareness Platforms, Block Chain, Processes as a Service, etc, that enable the next generation of CISs.  
   
  In developing the next generation CISs, research is needed towards (1) the applicability and use of the above mentioned innovative technologies, (2) approaches to develop CISs in particular catering towards the multitude of stakeholders involved in the development of socio-cyber-physical systems, and (3) associated modelling techniques to express and analyse the different aspects of these systems in cohesion.  
   
  The CoopIS conference series is an established international event for presenting and discussing scientific contributions about technical, economical, and societal aspects of distributed information systems at scale.  

 Upcoming Edition  
 CoopIS 2024  will take place in Porto, Portugal (19-21 November 2024). This 30th edition  is organized by INSTICC  . More information can be found at https://coopis.scitevents.org/   

 CoopIS Conferences  
 The CoopIS conference series began in 1993 as the International Conference on Intelligent and Cooperative Information Systems and was renamed the International Conference on Cooperative Information Systems in 1994. The first edition in 1993 was created by Prof. Robert Meersman (VUB, Belgium). From 2002 to 2019, CoopIS was part of a federated conference, held jointly with the International Symposium on Distributed Objects and Applications (DOA) and the International Conference on Ontologies, Databases, and Applications of Semantics (ODBASE) for large-scale information systems. After a hiatus during the COVID-19 pandemic, CoopIS resumed in 2022. Since 2000, CoopIS proceedings have been published by Springer Verlag in their Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.  
 The conference began in Rotterdam and subsequently traveled to various locations, including Catania, Sicily in 2003; Cyprus in 2004 and 2005; Montpellier in 2006; Vilamoura in 2007 and 2009; Monterrey, Mexico in 2008; Heraklion, Crete in 2010 and 2011; Rome in 2012; Graz in 2013; Amantea, Italy in 2014; Rhodes in 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2019; Valletta in 2018; Bozen-Bolzano in 2022; Groningen in 2023; and Porto in 2024.
