 Biomolecular computing has emerged as an interdisciplinary field that draws together molecular biology, chemistry, computer science and mathematics. Our knowledge on DNA nanotechnology and biomolecular computing increases exponentially with every passing year. The annual international meeting in the field began in 1995 right after the landmark work by L. Adleman, who solved an instance of the Hamiltonian path problem by DNA molecules and opened the door to this new field. Since then, the meeting has been a forum where scientists with different backgrounds, yet sharing a common interest in biomolecular computing meet, and present their latest results.  
 The annual meeting was called International Meeting on DNA Based Computers   till 2003 (DNA9), and from 2004 (DNA10) it is called International Meeting on DNA Computing.   From 2009 (DNA15), the meeting is called International Conference on DNA Computing and Molecular Programming.
