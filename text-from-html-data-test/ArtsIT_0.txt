  About ArtsIT 2023   
 The ArtsIT conference brings together a wide array of cross-/inter-/trans-disciplinary researchers, practitioners, artists, and academia to present and discuss the symbiosis between art (in its widest definition) and information technology applied in a variety of distinct fields. Since 2009 ArtsIT has become acknowledged as a leading scientific forum for the dissemination of cutting-edge research results in the intersection between art, science, culture, performing arts, media, and technology. The role of artistic practice using digital media is also to serve as a tool for analysis and critical reflection on how technologies influence our lives, culture, and society. ArtsIT is therefore not only a place to discuss technological progress but also a place to reflect on the impact of art and technology on sustainability, responsibility, and human dignity. Besides the main track, the event also focuses on the advances seen in diverse areas that have significantly contributed to the field in the last years, namely, Digital Musical Interfaces, virtualization and artificial intelligence with special sessions.  
 Campinas is a Brazilian city located in the southeast region of São Paulo State and is situated a few kilometers from the Tropic of Capricorn, which crosses São Paulo State. It is the first Brazilian city to become a metropolis without being a capital, exerting significant national influence. The city is home to several universities, including UNICAMP, the State University of Campinas, ranked among the top five universities in Latin America. In only 57 years, this university has achieved international recognition by fulfilling its mission of building and disseminating knowledge and innovation.  
 This year, ArtsIT is hosted by NICS, the Interdisciplinary Nucleus of Sound Studies, as part of its 40th anniversary. Formed in 1983, NICS’ primary objective is to research different manifestations of sound, in all its aspects and applications, as a source of informational, cognitive, and creative content. The nucleus was founded with a vocation for interdisciplinary research, addressing innovative themes for the time that continue to be updated, including sound pollution, analysis of sounds in Brazilian forests, phonetics of their fauna and native populations, electronic music, and ethnomusicological records.
