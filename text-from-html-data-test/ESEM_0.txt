 ESEIW 2023 & ESEM 2023  
   
 Welcome to the joint website of ESEIW 2023  , the Empirical Software Engineering International Week 2023, and ESEM 2023  , the 17th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement.  
 The ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM) is the premier conference for presenting research results related to empirical software engineering. ESEM provides a stimulating forum where researchers and practitioners can present and discuss recent research results on a wide range of topics, in addition to exchanging ideas, experiences, and challenging problems.  
 Registration is now open! Please visit the Registration Page  for more information.  
  ESEIW will be held as a fully on-site event — looking forward to meeting you in New Orleans!   .  
 ESEM’23 is proud to announce that we will have ACM CAPS support. ACM CAPS  provides travel support (but not registration support) for students and professionals to attend ACM SIGSOFT conferences. We will be including a link to the application as we get closer to registration, stay tuned for more details!

 David C. Shepherd: Empirical Research (Can) Lead to Industrial Impact; Learning from Experience   

 “The Pasteur’s quadrant approach implies that it is possible to couple, simultaneously, the development of fundamental science to the solution of problems important to society." -Donald Stokes  
  
  Too often software engineering research lives in an alternate, academic world, completely divorced from the reality of industrial practice. The ESEM community, pioneered by researchers like Victor Basili and strengthened by countless researchers, aims to destroy this false dichotomy. Through case studies, qualitative studies, and academia-industry collaborations this field seeks to learn about and influence industrial practice. In this talk I will detail my experience with industrial-facing research, with an eye towards techniques that were fruitful, as well as approaches that fell short. By sharing my experiences, from my success working with ABB Robotics to my frustrations when releasing open source software development tools, my hope is that the ESEM community can be better equipped in their goal of studying and influencing the software engineering industry.
