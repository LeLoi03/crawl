 Computability in Europe 2023  
 Unity of Logic and Computation  
 24-28 July 2023, Batumi, Georgia  

 About CiE 2023  
 The event is the 19th conference organized by CiE (Computability in Europe)  , a European association of mathematicians, logicians, computer scientists, philosophers, physicists and others interested in new developments in computability and their underlying significance for the real world. The conference will be held in hybrid mode.   
 Previous meetings have taken place in Amsterdam (2005), Swansea (2006), Siena (2007), Athens (2008), Heidelberg (2009), Ponta Delgada (2010), Sofia (2011), Cambridge (2012), Milan (2013), Budapest (2014), Bucharest (2015), Paris (2016), Turku (2017), Kiel (2018), Durham (2019), Salerno (2020, virtually), Ghent (2021, virtually), and Swansea (2022).

 Submissions  
   
 Conference Topics | The CiE conferences serve as an interdisciplinary forum for research in all aspects of computability, foundations of computer science, logic, and theoretical computer science, as well as the interplay of these areas with practical issues in computer science and with other disciplines such as biology, mathematics, philosophy, or physics. 
  Paper Submission | THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE cordially invites all researchers, European and non-European, to submit their papers in all areas related to the above for presentation at the conference and inclusion in the proceedings of CiE 2023 at EasyChair  .  
 Papers submitted to the conference proceedings should represent original work, not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference with formal proceedings. The Program Committee will rigorously review and select submitted papers. Accepted papers will be published as a proceedings volume in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series from Springer-Verlag.  
 Papers to be considered in the conferences proceedings must be submitted in PDF format, using the LNCS style (see Springer conference proceedings guidelines  ) and must have a maximum of 12 pages, including references but excluding a possible appendix in which one can include proofs and other additional material. Papers building bridges between different parts of the research community are particularly welcome. 
  Informal Presentations | Continuing the tradition of past CiE conferences, we invite researchers to present informal presentations of their recent work. A proposal for an informal presentation must be submitted via EasyChair  , using the LNCS style (see Springer conference proceedings guidelines  ), and be 1 page long; a brief description of the results suffices and an abstract is not required. Informal presentations will not be published in the LNCS conference proceedings. Results presented as informal presentations at CiE 2023 may appear or may have appeared in other conferences with formal proceedings and/or in journals. 
  Important Dates | Article submission deadline: | February 15, 2023 | (AoE) 
  Author notification: | April 20, 2023 
  Camera-ready due: | May 1, 2023 
  Informal presentations deadline: | June 8, 2023 | (acceptance notifications will be sent a few days after submission) 
  Early registration deadline: | June 18, 2023 

 Travel Grants  
 Application for travel grants is overdue.  
   
 Women in Computability | We are happy to announce that within the framework of the Women in Computability program, we are able to offer some grants for junior women researchers who want to participate in CiE 2023. Applications for this grant should be sent to Liesbeth de Mol, liesbeth.de-mol@univ-lille.fr  , before May 15, 2023  and include a short cv (at most 2 pages) and contact information for an academic reference. Preference will be given to junior women researchers who are presenting a paper (including informal presentations) at CiE 2023. 
  ASL Student Travel Award | We are happy to announce that the Association for Symbolic Logic (ASL) is offering Student Travel Awards  for ASL members  who want to participate in CiE 2023. Applications for this award should be submitted to the ASL office before April 24, 2023  . For more details, please consult the Student Travel Awards page  or contact Shannon Miller, the ASL administrator, at asl@uconn.edu  .

 Hotels  
 Scam emails warning:  with our past experience, sometimes conference participants are receiving emails (sent e.g. from "support@ehotelservices.org" or "ops@travellerpoint.org"), offering the booking of hotel accomodation for conference dates. This is a scam!  You will find some unpleasant stories  about such companies if you google their name. Be careful  - the company name and email can change while the phishing method stays the same.  
 We do not have arrangements with hotels or agencies other than is listed below and these hotels do not ask credit card information!
