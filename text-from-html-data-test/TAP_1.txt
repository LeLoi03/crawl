 SecOPERA at 17th International Conference on Tests and Proofs (TAP 2023)  
 / News   / By alexander      

 SecOPERA partner CEA  actively participated in the 17th International Conference on Tests and Proofs (TAP)  , which was held on 18-19 July in Leicester, UK. This conference, organized by the University of Leicester as part of the STAF federation of conferences, aimed to foster research in software verification, focusing on the convergence of tests and formal methods. The program committee, co-chaired by Virgile Prevosto, facilitated the gathering of researchers and practitioners from both realms to exchange ideas and present their findings.  
 The results presented in the conference are thus primarily useful for the application layer of SecOPERA, notably for the Security Audit engine.  
 Key highlights of the conference included research track sessions, which drew attendance 20 to 30 individuals, and two insightful invited talks that attracted a crowd of 30 to 40 attendees.
