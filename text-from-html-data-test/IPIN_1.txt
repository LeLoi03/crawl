 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, IPIN2020 Organisers and IPIN Steering Committee have decided to cancel this year's IPIN conference.  
   
  Beijing will host IPIN2022, and we keep with our plans to have IPIN2021 in Barcelona.  
   
  To keep the continuity of IPIN in 2020, we are considering the possibility of still run some IPIN activities such as the offline competitions, which can be organised remotely. Details will be released in due course.  
   
  Thanks for your support to IPIN.
