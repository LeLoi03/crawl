 IEEE Quantum Week  — the IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE)  — is bridging the gap between the science of quantum computing and the development of an industry surrounding it. As such, this event brings a perspective to the quantum industry different from academic or business conferences. IEEE Quantum Week is a multidisciplinary quantum computing and engineering venue that gives attendees the unique opportunity to discuss challenges and opportunities with quantum researchers, scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, developers, students, practitioners, educators, programmers, and newcomers.  

 With outstanding contributions and participation from the international quantum community, IEEE Quantum Week 2023 has formed an Exceptional Program   with exciting exhibits   featuring technologies from quantum companies, start-ups and research labs. QCE23, the fourth IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering, will feature a career fair   , 9 world-class keynote speakers   , 30 workforce-building tutorials   , 32 community-building workshops   , 153 stellar technical papers   13 stimulating panels   , 93 innovative posters   , and 4 Birds-of-a-Feather sessions   .   

 QCE23 will be held as an  in-person event with virtual participation in Bellevue, Washington, USA  at the  Hyatt Regency Bellevue on Seattle’s Eastside   .  After three highly successful IEEE Quantum Week events, w  e are eager to develop an oustanding conference program with  live exhibits, world-class keynote speakers, technical papers, community building workshops,  workforce-building tutorials  , stimulating panels, innovative posters, thought-provoking Birds of Feather (BoF) sessions, networking, sessions. Attend in-person for the full conference experience!  Virtual registration options are available for those who are unable to travel to Bellevue, Washington, USA.    

 With your contributions and support, together we are building a wonderful premier meeting of quantum minds to help advance the fields of quantum computing and engineering. IEEE Quantum Week provides ample opportunities to network with your peers and explore partnerships with industry, government, and academia. Quantum Week 2023 aims to bring together quantum professionals, researchers, educators, entrepreneurs, champions and enthusiasts to exchange and share their experiences, challenges, research results, innovations, applications, pathways and enthusiasm on all aspects of quantum computing and engineering.   
 IEEE Quantum Week aims to showcase quantum research, practice, applications, education, and training including programming systems, software engineering methods & tools,  hybrid quantum-classical computing, architectures & algorithms , benchmarks & performance metrics, hardware engineering, architectures, & topologies as well as many applications including simulation of chemical, physical and biological systems, optimization techniques & solutions, and quantum machine learning.
