 Researching the future of gaming  
 The Exertion Games Lab researches the future of play and games in order to understand how to design better interactive experiences, in particular we focus on games that put the human body in the centre of the experience. We draw from interaction design, sports, psychology, human-computer interaction (HCI) and embodiment thinking to contribute to human-player interaction.  
     
 We are always looking for excellent PhD, Master and undergraduate students as well as interns, if interested please get in contact.   

 Coming up  
 Dagstuhl “Designing Computers’ Control Over Our Bodies”, 2-7 Jun 2024  
    
  DIS, 1-5 Jul 2024
