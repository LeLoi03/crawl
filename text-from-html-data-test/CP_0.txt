 CP 2023  
 The International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming (CP) is the premier annual conference on all aspects of computing with constraints, including theory, algorithms, models, solvers, and a diverse range of applications in machine learning/artificial intelligence, planning, and scheduling, to name a few. This is the 29th version of the CP series  organized by the Association for Constraint Programming  .  
 The CP 2023 program will include presentations of high quality scientific papers on constraints technology, featuring multiple thematic tracks. It will be located at the beautiful Toronto, Canada  , at the University of Toronto St. George campus (downtown). Apart from the Technical Program consisting of the Main track and four tracks (Applications, Machine Learning, Operations Research and Trustworthy Decision-Making), there will be invited talks, tutorials and workshops.
