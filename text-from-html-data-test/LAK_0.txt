  Toward Trustworthy Learning Analytics  

 Society for Learning Analytics Research  
 The Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR) is an interdisciplinary network of leading international researchers who are exploring the role and impact of analytics on teaching, learning, training and development.  

 About University of Texas at Arlington  
 The local host of LAK23 is the University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie Research 1 institution with more than 100 years of academic excellence and tradition. It’s centrally located between Dallas (to the east) and Fort Worth (to the west). Arlington is easily accessible and is located 30 minutes from the two major airports in the metroplex—DFW International Airport, which is the 2nd busiest airport in the world, and Love Field. Less than two miles from AT&T Stadium and Globe Life Park, where the Dallas Cowboys and Texas Rangers, respectively, play, and less than three miles from Six Flags Over Texas, UTA is just a stone’s throw away from the excitement the city has to offer.  

 LAK23 Planning  
 As SoLAR and conference organizers announced on May 5, 2022, LAK23 will now take place in Arlington, Texas, USA to ensure that a face-to-face event can take place. Please see the full announcement for full details on the reasoning behind this change. Hybrid options will be available and more information will be forthcoming as the planning process continues. Please check back here regularly for updates and be sure to follow us on social media and sign up for the SoLAR newsletter  to receive the latest information from the learning analytics community.
