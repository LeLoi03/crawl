 Domain Specific-Modelling: An Engineering Design Perspective  Bunakiye Japheth    
 Models are simply outcomes from levels of abstractions, so developing a modelling language is an effort in creating a platform where the domain concepts can be mapped to the abstraction levels. Once this mapping is achieved, it will create a stakeholder or domain expert user friendly notations from the concepts description. This will then enable the stakeholders the freedom to express and achieve design intents and as well cope with the complexity of conventional design software. In this paper, the vocabulary of components created from the domain concepts served a useful purpose of mapping the domain concepts to the model abstractions in the form of attributes of CAD (computer aided design) objects representing the pipeline physical components.
