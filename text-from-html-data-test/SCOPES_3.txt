 Workshops  
 Compuing Frontiers 2023 hosts a variety of workshops and special sessions on various topics providing a great opportunity for networking and discussion with fellow researchers. These workshops and special sessions are complementary to the main confrence track and are co-located. These will be announced at a later time.  
 Submission of papers to the workshops is handled separately from the main conference. Please refer to the websites of the workshops for submission deadlines and more details.  
  2nd Annual Compiler Frontiers Workshop (2023)  
 Aim and scope:   
  As architectures grow in complexity and power/performance requirements evolve far beyond what traditional data center environments offer, advances in compiler technology are paramount to enable the construction of performant, power-efficient, and resilient application payloads. The ability to build programming model support, compilers, optimizers, and associated tooling for advanced architectures is now at the forefront of computer science and computer architecture research. This workshop seeks to bring together researchers and experts from industry and academia to present the latest advances in Compilers for Computing Frontiers. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: Compiler extensions for HPC, HPDC, IoT, Cloud, and Edge computing 
  Compiler design for low power environments 
  Compiler design for extreme parallelism 
  Compiler optimizations and optimization frameworks 
  Compiler optimizations for high-level abstractions 
  HExtensions to existing compiler frameworks: CLANG, GCC, MLIR, LLVM, etc. 
  Template meta-programming constructs 
  Domain-specific language compilers 
  Compiler re-targeting for non-traditional/special-purpose architectures 
  Compiler extensions for AI/ML architectures 
  Application of ML to compiler technologies 
  Compiler design for hardware description languages 
  Compiler extensions for High-Level Synthesis tools targeting FPGAs or ASICs

   Malicious Software and Hardware in Internet of Things (MaL-IoT '23)  
 Aim and scope:   
  Cyber-physical and smart embedded systems, already highly networked will be even more connected in the near future to form the Internet of Things, handling large amount of private and safety critical data. The pervasive diffusion of these devices will create several threats to privacy and could open new possibilities for attackers, since the security of even large portions of the Internet of Things could be harmed by compromising a reduced number of components. The possibility of securely updating devices should be guaranteed and it should be possible to verify and assert the root of trust of components. With respect to this context we expect contributions in different areas of security in Internet of Things. Topics of the workshop include but are not limited to:  
 Malicious firmware design and detection 
  Malware in Internet of Things applications 
  Hardware root of trust 
  Privacy issues of smart-home systems and complex systems 
  Hardware Trojans and their effects on systems 
  Hardware authentication and IP protection 
  Secure communication and key-management 
  Implementation attacks and countermeasures 
  Emerging threats and attack vectors in the Internet of Things 
  Supply chain security
