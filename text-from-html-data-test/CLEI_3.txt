 The 2023 Latin American Conference on Informatics will be held on Tuesday, October 17, starting at 13:00 GMT, with the theme "Towards an integrated and transversal vision of the state of cybersecurity in Latin America and the Caribbean". The event is organized by the Latin American Center for Informatics Studies (CLEI) and the Network of Excellence in Cybersecurity in Latin America and the Caribbean (Red CiberLaC), with the support of the Inter-American Development Bank.   
 The Conferencia will be held virtually, with the participation of recognized actors in the field of cybersecurity from academia, government and industry, as well as international organizations in the region. It also seeks to disseminate different relevant topics on cybersecurity, and to give visibility to the progress and development needs of the region in this area.  
 Presentations will cover different aspects of cybersecurity. In the morning there will be individual presentations by recognized researchers in the domain of public key infrastructure (PKI) and digital signature, cybersecurity training platforms and post-quantum cryptography. The afternoon will feature panels covering aspects of governance, interaction with civil society, standards and government cybersecurity policies.
