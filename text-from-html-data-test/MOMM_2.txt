 Our latest research paper introduces a transformative mobile application designed to support the occupational therapy for children with ADHD. This app, part of a comprehensive smart-home environment, enables therapists and parents to remotely observe and interact with children during therapy sessions.  
 Key Findings:   
 Enhanced Monitoring: The app provides real-time behavioral tracking, offering detailed insights into children’s actions during therapy tasks. This facilitates more informed therapeutic decisions and timely adjustments, including medication management. 
  Ease of Use: Both therapists and parents found the app user-friendly and intuitive, leading to increased parental involvement in therapy and efficient setup by therapists without technical expertise. 
  Customization and Adaptability: The app allows therapists to customize therapy settings, including the sensitivity of smart objects and robotic assistants, catering to each child’s unique needs. 
  Positive Feedback: Post-experimental trials, the application received positive reviews from therapists and parents, highlighting its value in simplifying data interpretation and providing tailored insights for individual therapy sessions. 
  This mobile application addresses the critical need for effective, real-time monitoring and intervention in ADHD therapy, presenting a significant advancement in the field. It demonstrates the potential to enhance therapy outcomes and actively involves parents in the therapeutic process, marking a new era in ADHD management.
