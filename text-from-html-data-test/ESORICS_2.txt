European Symposium on Research in Computer Security  
 Home Page  
  Computer security is concerned with the protection of information in environments where there is a possibility of intrusion or malicious action. The aim of ESORICS is to further the progress of research in computer security by establishing a European forum for bringing together researchers in this area, by promoting the exchange of ideas with system developers and by encouraging links with researchers in related areas.  
  Progressively organised in a series of European countries, the symposium is confirmed as the European research event in computer security.

 ESORICS IN THE FUTURE  
 Call for Hosts  
   
 The aim of ESORICS is to further the progress of research in computer, information and cyber security and in privacy, by establishing a European forum for bringing together researchers in this area, by promoting the exchange of ideas with system developers and by encouraging links with researchers in related areas.  
   
  Since its inception in 1990, ESORICS has been hosted in a series of European countries and has established itself as the premiere European research event in computer security. Recent editions of ESORICS were held in Copenhagen - Denmark (2022), Darmstadt - Germany (online) (2021), Guildford - UK (online) (2020), Luxembourg (2019), Barcelona - Spain (2018), Oslo - Norway (2017), Heraklion - Greece (2016), Vienna - Austria (2015), Wroclaw - Poland (2014), Egham - United Kingdom (2013), Pisa - Italy (2012) and Leuven - Belgium (2011).  
   
  The ESORICS Steering Committee  are looking for prospective organizers (Universities Research centers) to host future editions of ESORICS. We would like to offer the opportunity to help us continue to make ESORICS a memorable experience for a large number of participants, while gaining visibility for your own institution. Joint bids are encouraged, as are applications from countries where ESORICS has not previously been held. The full list of previous ESORICS editions is available here  .  
   
  This Call for Hosts is open to prospective organizers who are able to offer: An easily accessible location from across Europe (international airport hub) 
  1 plenary room that can comfortably accommodate at least 250 people, with AV equipment 
  3 parallel plenary rooms for at least 80 people each, with AV equipment, close to the plenary room 
  6 breakout rooms for 40-60 people each, with a computer and projector, close to the plenary room, for ESORICS collocated workshops 
  Catering area for at least 250 people for coffee and lunch breaks 
  Technical support 
  Support staff for the preparation of ESORICS 
  Capacity to handle online registration payments 
  ESORICS is a full-costing event, which means that all costs related to the organization are fully covered by the revenue it raises. In order to do so, the organizers and hosts will rely on two types of funding: revenue from registration fees and support from sponsors. It should be noted that the ESORICS organizers are not-for-profit organizations which means that the financial management will be entirely planned to enable costs to be covered at a minimal risk level with no intention of making a profit on the event. To receive further details on the conditions of hosting ESORICS and the process for submitting a bid, please contact Prof. Joaquin Garcia-Alfaro, chair of the ESORICS Steering Committee at  joaquin.garcia_alfaro@telecom-sudparis.eu  Email address protected by JavaScript.  
  Please enable JavaScript to contact this user.   .  
   
  Bids should provide information on the venue and its capacity in terms of rooms to be used during the conference; tentative dates; technical program, organizing and other committee members; the city/area where the conference is to be held; and accommodation options; and preliminary budget calculations. Bidders will be expected to attend ESORICS and present their bid to the ESORICS Steering Committee.
