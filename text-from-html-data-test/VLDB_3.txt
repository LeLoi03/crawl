 VLDB 2023: Call for Contributions - Industrial, Applications, and Experience Track  
 The Industrial Track of VLDB 2023 will cover all aspects of innovative commercial or industrial-strength data management systems and solutions. We also welcome novel real-world applications of data management systems and experience in applying recent research advances to real-world problems. We require that at least one of the authors has a non-academic affiliation.  
 Submission Guidelines  
 We accept full papers (up to 12 pages + references) and extended abstracts (up to 6 pages + references). The papers should be prepared using the VLDB 2023 paper formatting guidelines. Submissions must be made electronically, in pdf format, at the conference submission site: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/PVLDBv16_2023  . Submissions to the industrial track are required to include all author names and affiliations. Any changes to authorship after paper acceptance will require approval by the industrial track chairs. Authors are encouraged to contact the industrial track chairs if they need any clarification regarding the suitability of their work to this track. Conflicts of Interest  
 It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all and only the PC members with whom they have a conflict of interest (COI), as defined below. Papers with incorrect or incomplete COI information at the time when submission closes will be desk rejected. To minimize biases in the evaluation process, we use CMT's conflict management system, through which authors should flag conflicts with members of the Editorial Board. X and Y have a conflict of interest if any of the following applies: X and Y have worked in the same university or company in the past two years, or will be doing so in the next six months on account of an accepted job offer. Different campuses within the same university system do not count as the same university for this purpose - UC Berkeley does not have a conflict with UC Santa Barbara; 
  X has been a co-author of a paper with Y in the last 3 years, or of 4 (or more) papers in the last 10 years; 
  X has been a collaborator within the past two years, as evidenced in a joint publication (subsumed by the stricter rule on co-authorship above), joint research project, or jointly organized event, or are collaborating now; 
  X is the PhD thesis advisor of Y or vice versa, irrespective of how long ago this was; or 
  X is a relative or close personal friend of Y;
