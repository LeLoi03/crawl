 ABOUT Conference  Welcome to CODS-COMAD Dec’24  
 CODS-COMAD is a premier international conference focusing on scientific work in Databases, Data Sciences and their applications. Being held for the 8th time as a common conference bringing together the COMAD and the CODS communities, this conference invites researchers in the field of databases, data sciences and their applications to submit their original work.  
 The conference has a long and rich history. COMAD, primarily a data management conference, started in 1989. CODS started in 2014 with AI, Machine Learning and Data Science as its focus.These merged in 2018 to become the vibrant CODS-COMAD conference of today. The current conference is marked by keynote talks by stalwarts, research and applied data science tracks presenting original work of high quality, topical tutorials and demo tracks showcasing innovation in action. The Young Researchers Symposium has evolved as a valued forum for providing early feedback to budding and early career researchers. The conference consistently attracts funding from top research labs, and other data-centric companies and startups. This sponsorship enables providing support to students from across the country to attend the conference. Since 2021, the conference has been hosting a track on Diversity and Inclusion to promote this crucial aspect in the data science and databases community. In short, the conference has been striving to bring the data-centric community together, specially in India, and also more generally around the world.  
 CODS-COMAD Dec’24 will be hosted by IIT Jodhpur  
  during 18-21 December, 2024.
