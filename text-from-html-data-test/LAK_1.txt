 International Conference on Learning Analytics & Knowledge (LAK)  

 Home      Events      International Conference on Learning Analytics & Knowledge (LAK)    

 The International Conference on Learning Analytics & Knowledge  is the premier research forum in the field, providing common ground for all stakeholders in the design of analytics systems to debate the state of the art at the intersection of Learning and Analytics — including researchers, educators, instructional designers, data scientists, software developers, institutional leaders and governmental policy makers.  
 The conference is held in cooperation with ACM  in association with ACM SIGCHI  and SIGWEB  , with the double-blind, peer-reviewed proceedings archived in the ACM Digital Library  (contingent upon a yearly approval process through ACM). The ACM Digital Library (DL) is the world's most comprehensive database of full-text articles and bibliographic literature covering computing and information technology. This renowned repository includes the complete collection of ACM publications plus an extended bibliographic database of core works in computing from scholarly publishers. This guarantees that the proceedings will be available to the widest possible audience of computing professionals. ACM has an enlightened copyright policy  with liberal author rights: authors may self-archive their own papers as Open Access Preprints, as long as they carry the specified ACM statement.  
 For further detailed information regarding the International Conference on Learning Analytics & Knowledge  , please review the Conference Program Committee Guidelines  . This document provides details regarding program chair selection, duties and responsibilities, program committee selection, and review process.
