 Title  : Asynchronous Temporal Equilibrium Logic 
 Abstract  : Temporal Answer Set Programming is concerned with extending the stable models semantics of logic programs to a temporal setting, which may by fruitfully used for applications such as planning and reasoning about actions. The logical characerisation of stable models in terms of Equilibrium logic, in which models from the (monotonic) intermediate logic of Here-and-There are selected under a minimality condition, lends itself for defining a stable models variant of linear temporal logic (LTL) in terms of Temporal Equilibrium Logic (TEL), which selects traces from Temporal Here-and-There (THT) under a minimality condition that traces of the same length pointwise. We consider a stricter selection, which we call asynchronous TEL, where a trace can be smaller than another by making less atoms true or by reducing the number of transitions in the trace. In a way, the latter amounts to a contraction of the larger trace. We illustrate the effect on examples and and explore some properties of the notion, which may be used for summarisation and compact example construction, for instance. This is joint work with Pedro Cabalar from the University of A Coruna. 
 Bio  : Thomas Eiter is a professor in the Faculty of Informatics at the Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien), Austria, where he obtained his PhD in 1991 and heads the Knowledge-Based Systems Group and the Institute of Logic and Computation. He has been active in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, where he made contributions  to knowledge representation and reasoning, e.g. in his work on reasoning with incomplete and/or inconsistent information, contextual reasoning, combining rules and ontologies, and to declarative problem solving. Eiter is an ACM Fellow, a Fellow of the European Association for AI, and Member of the Austrian and the European Academy of Sciences, respectively.

 Title  : Learning Temporal Logic Formulas from Time-series Data 
 Abstract  : The availability of data has spurred the utilization of machine learning techniques for system analysis. While these methods excel in complex, high-dimensional scenarios and generate powerful black-box models, they often lack uncertainty measures and fail to fully understand the underlying mechanisms. This limitation becomes especially crucial in safety-critical systems, where failures can be costly. Therefore, designers must comprehend system phenomena and extract meaningful knowledge from the data. To tackle this challenge, recent research has explored the application of learning Temporal Logic (TL) formulae as a means of extracting human-interpretable information. TL offers precise formal formulae that are easily comprehensible to humans and provides verification algorithms that can automatically evaluate the fulfillment of desired properties. In this talk, we provide an overview of recent advancements in this field, with a specific focus on learning Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is particularly well-suited for expressing properties related to real-time trajectories. We delve into supervised and semi-supervised learning problems, highlighting the utility of TL formulae, e.g. for anomaly detection. Additionally, we show how the consideration of spatial aspects in system behavior can be accomplished by using STREL, an extension of STL with a number of spatial operators. 
 Bio  : Laura Nenzi is an expert in formal verification. Her research is mainly focused on the design of temporal logics to specify and monitor large-scale spatially distributed systems. In the last few years, she is investigating the combination of formal verification with Bayesian and machine learning techniques. She is also working on explainable AI, designing methodologies for learning formal specifications from data. Since November 2021, she is an Assistant Professor (with tenure-track) at the Department of Engineering and Architecture at the University of Trieste, Italy. Before that, she had a part-time double position as Project Assistant at TU Wien Austria and Assistant Professor (without tenure-track) at the University of Trieste. She holds a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the IMT Lucca, Italy (2017) and a master’s degree in Mathematics from the University of Trieste (2012), both completed with the highest marks. She was co-PI of the project ZK-35: "High-dimensional statistical learning: new methods to advance economic and sustainability policies" (Total Funding ∼2 Mio Euro), within the Austrian Science Fund's (FWF) "Young Independent Researcher Groups" programme, for which she lead the TU participation. She received the Hedy Lamarr Award 2020 from the City of Vienna. The award recognizes women in Austria for their exceptional achievements in the field of information technology.
