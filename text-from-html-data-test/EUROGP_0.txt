    The 26th European Conference on Genetic Programming (EuroGP) 2023 conference will take place as part of EvoStar (Evo*).  
   
  EuroGP is the premier annual conference on Genetic Programming (GP), the oldest and the only meeting worldwide devoted specifically to this branch of evolutionary computation. It is always a high-quality, enjoyable, friendly event, attracting participants from all continents, and offering excellent opportunities for networking, informal contact, and exchange of ideas with fellow researchers. It will feature a mixture of oral presentations and poster sessions and invited keynote speakers. EuroGP is featured in the conference ranking database CORE  .  
 You can consult the proceedings of previous events at EuroGP Conference Proceedings in SpringerLink   
 A comprehensive bibliography of genetic programming literature and links to related material is accessible at the Genetic Programming Bibliography  web page, part of the Collection of Computer Science Bibliographies maintained and managed by William Langdon, Steven Gustafson, and John Koza.

  Submission Details  
 Accepted papers will be published by Springer Nature in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Submissions must be original and not published elsewhere. They will be peer reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. The reviewing process will be double-blind, so please omit information about the authors in the submitted paper  . Submit your manuscript in Springer LNCS format  .  
 Page limit:  16 pages.  
 Submission link:  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=evo2023   
 The authors of accepted papers will have to improve their paper on the basis of the reviewers’ comments and will be asked to send a camera ready version of their manuscripts (notifications will be sent on 18 January, 2023  ) and the camera-ready deadline will be on 1 February, 2023  ). At least one author of each accepted work has to register for the conference not later than 27 February 2023,  attend the conference and present the work.  
 Presentation Details  
 Long talks: | Your work will be presented in a 20 minute talk followed by a 5 minute discussion round. We also encourage you to bring and present a poster in the poster session to take advantage of a more informal and direct feedback. 
  Short talks (posters): | Your work will be presented in a 10 minute talk (no discussion round) and in a poster session. Please be aware that oral and poster presentations are | MANDATORY | .
