 Organization  
 The ICAT-EGVE 2023 conference will be held between December 6th and December 8th at Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland. The ICAT-EGVE is the merger of the 33rd International Conference on Artificial Reality and Telexistence (ICAT 2023) and the 28th Eurographics Symposium on Virtual Environments (EGVE 2023). Together, these are two of the oldest international conferences in the world on Artificial Reality and Virtual Environments.

 Submission Guidelines: Papers  
 The following are the guidelines for the submission of full and short papers:  
 Full papers must not exceed eight (8) pages in length (excluding references). 
  Short papers must not exceed four (4) pages in length (excluding references). 
  Both full and short papers must be in English and should be formatted using the 
  Eurographics format. A sample LaTeX document for ICAT-EGVE 2023 can be found here: | https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/ICAT-EGVE_2023/Instruction 
  ICAT-EGVE uses a double-blind review process. Therefore, submissions should not contain information (including citations and optional videos) that unnecessarily identifies the authors or their institutions or places of work. All papers must be submitted electronically as PDF. Authors are encouraged to submit videos to aid the program committee in the review of their submissions. 
  The conference uses the EG submission tool. All submissions should be made through the online submission system: | https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/ICAT-EGVE_2023 | Note: On SRM, for your full paper submission, please select "-" as the category. If you have any questions regarding how to modify your submission, please see the following help link:  
  https://wiki.eg.org/SRMv2Wiki/index.php/Modify_your_submission 
  Submissions should be original, unpublished work, and should not be in submission to other venues concurrently. Any dual submission will be rejected outright without review. 
     
 Submission of Posters and Demos  
 Please note there is a separate submisison portal for our Posters and Demos programme, for which we are now also accepting submissions. For details, please see the Call for Posters and Demos  .  
    
 Review and Publication
