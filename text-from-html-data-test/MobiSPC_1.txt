The 18th International Conference on Future Networks and Communications  
  August 14-16, 2023, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada   

  to FNC 2023 that will be held in conjunction with  
  The 20th International Conference on Mobile Systems and Pervasive Computing (MobiSPC)   
  
 What is it about?  Research in networks and communication technologies requires very significant investments of stakeholders for enabling our future networking society. Research in network communication has made several possible innovations having a strong influence on people's lives. Mobile communications and the Internet are two outstanding examples. Future Networks and Communications technologies, including mobile broadband and all optical networks are the key to the ground-breaking inventions to our future technologies. It will enable us to design and build the future communication infrastructure interconnecting and empowering the next generation enabling platforms.  
 While the technology itself develops faster and faster, the deployment and implementation of a new network infrastructure technology can take up to ten years. The future networks communication research will deliver the next generation of network technologies enabling smart connectivity for all, anywhere, and at any time at the highest speed and efficiency so as to meet the overwhelming demand by today's society. This is why we need to enable a very reliable and dependable future networks and communication to ensure that industries; businesses and consumers can access and use the most advanced content and services they call for.  
 Location:  FNC 2023 will be held in Halifax Nova Scotia, Canada. Halifax is located on the east coast of Canada and is approximately a 6-hour flight from London, UK and a 2-hour flight from Toronto, Ontario. Halifax is a vibrant and modern city which is home to multiple academic institutions and where visitors can enjoy a variety of activities and entertainment from whale watching to Jazz festivals to world-class cuisine. Halifax is also home to the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic which contains the world largest collection of Titanic artifacts. Nova Scotia is a picturesque province with many National and Provincial parks, and as stated in the Guinness Book of World Records, has the highest tides in the world. e.  
 Target Audience:  International Conference on Future Networks and Communications (FNC) is designed for practitioners, researchers, scientists and administrators, in the development arenas. FNC will become the new "system blood" as it aims to provide discussions and simulations in the communication technology at the broad level and broadcasting technology and related technologies at the micro level. Through a set of research papers, using innovative and interactive approach, participants can expect to share a set of research that will prepare them to apply new technologies to their work in teaching, research and educational development amid this rapidly evolving landscape.  
 There will be opportunities to attend interactive, high quality, peer reviewed sessions, which will provide detailed insights from forward thinkers working in the themes of the conference. The conference will include a number of specialized workshops as well. Additionally there will be an exhibition for both international businesses and markets to display their latest products and services and to undertake a range of networking opportunities.  
 Scope of FNC:  FNC research effort will help achieving a major promise of the emerging technologies such as, ubiquitous access to broadband, supporting vital applications in our daily lives such as health, energy consumption, environment transport, entertainment or education. The scope of FNC is the development of energy-efficient future network infrastructures that support the convergence and interoperability of heterogeneous mobile, wired and wireless broadband network technologies as enablers of the future Internet. This includes but not limited to ubiquitous fast broadband access and ultra-high speed end-to-end optical connectivity, supporting open services and innovative ambient applications. Scope also embraces novel and evolutionary approaches to tackle network architectures, taking due consideration of users and societal needs for success.
