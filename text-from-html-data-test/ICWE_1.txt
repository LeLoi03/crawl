 Call for Research Papers – ICWE 2023​  

 ICWE 2023 - AT A GLANCE  

 The International Conference on Web Engineering (ICWE) is the premier annual conference on Web Engineering and associated technologies. Thus, the conference covers the different aspects of Web Engineering, including the design, creation, maintenance, operation, and usage of Web applications. ICWE 2023 will be held on June 6-9, 2023 in Alicante, Spain.   
 ICWE aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from various disciplines in academia and industry to tackle the emerging challenges in the engineering of Web applications, the problems and opportunities of its associated technologies, and the impact of those technologies on society and culture. The 23rd edition of ICWE has a wide spectrum of topics related to Web Engineering, such as, among others:   
 Web application modeling and engineering 
  Web infrastructures and architectures 
  Web mining and knowledge extraction 
  Web Big Data and Web data analytics 
  Execution models, e.g., serverless computing 
  Mobile Web applications 
  Web of Things applications 
  Social Web applications 
  Web crowdsourcing and human computation 
  Semantic Web, Web ontologies, and Linked Open Data applications 
  Web composition and mashups 
  Web user interfaces 
  Quality and accessibility aspects of Web applications 
  Web security, privacy, and identity 
  Web services, computing, and standards 
  Microservice architecture for Web applications 
  Cloud, fog, and edge computing for Web applications 
  Fair and explainable Web technology 
  User Modeling and Web-based Recommender Systems 
  Web standards 
  Disruptive Web technologies 
  Comparisons, data sets, empirical studies of Web technologies 
  Web Engineering for and with AI 
  In addition to the research track, ICWE 2023 also seeks contributions of demos and posters, student papers at the PhD Symposium, tutorials, and workshops, which will be subject of individual calls.   

 SUBMISSIONS TO THE RESEARCH TRACK  

 This call addresses research contributions in one of the following two categories:   
 Full papers: | mature, original research contribution. Reported results must be supported by some type of evaluation, and also include a justification about the choice/suitability of the evaluation method. In addition, evidence of use in practice and/or demonstration of scalability is regarded as a plus. (15 pages, Springer LNCS format) 
  Short papers: | short papers presenting a discussion – analysis, criticism, proposal, vision etc. – about relevant aspects of Web engineering topics. These papers are intended to generate discussions that promise potential for research that will impact Web Engineering in the coming years. (8 pages, Springer LNCS format) 
  Papers must be formatted according to the information for Springer LNCS authors at  https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines   and submitted in PDF format. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form, through which the copyright for their paper is transferred to Springer.   
 ICWE 2023 is following a single-anonymous review process.  
 Papers submitted to ICWE 2023 must not be under review elsewhere while under consideration for ICWE 2023, nor may have been already previously published elsewhere. Submissions that are not in compliance with the required submission format, stated page limits, or that are out of the scope of the conference will be desk rejected without reviewing.   
 At least one author of each accepted submission must register for the conference and present the work during the corresponding session in person.   
 Papers must be submitted electronically through the  ICWE 2023 EasyChair   web page.   
 Accepted contributions will be included into the ICWE 2023 Springer LNCS proceedings. The best papers will be selected to be proposed, in extended form, as part of a special issue of the Journal of Web Engineering.    
 Springer Best Paper Award sponsorship.  According to the contract between Springer and the International Society for Web Engineering, Springer sponsors the ICWE 2023 Best Paper Award that will be announced during the ICWE 2023 Banquet.   

 IMPORTANT DATES  

 All dates are according to the time zone “Anywhere on Earth”, i.e., UTC-12.
