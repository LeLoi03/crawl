 Welcome to CAiSE 202  3  
 The 35th Edition of the CAiSE conference series will be organised by SVIT at San Jorge University, and will be hosted in Zaragoza.  
 The conference will continue its tradition as the premiere venue for innovative and rigorous research across the whole spectrum of Information Systems Engineering with a special emphasis on the theme of Cyber-Human Systems  . This year’s theme reflects the increasingly coupled relationships between humans and computing, giving rise to cyber-human systems. The overall aim of these systems is to advance human abilities to work in complex environments. The theme refers to various aspects of the interface between humans and technology, with the intention to advance models, methods and theories relating to such systems. Examples include novel computing platforms (e.g., wearable devices), systems that interact with users through multiple modalities (e.g., brain-machine interfaces), human-in-the-loop approaches, local data processing in smart devices, and intelligent infrastructures for augmented life and society.
