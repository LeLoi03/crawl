 CARDIS 2023, November 15-16, 2023, in-person event  
 22nd Smart Card Research and Advanced Application Conference   
 Scope  
 CARDIS has been the venue for security experts from industry and academia to exchange on security of smart cards and related applications since 1994. Smart cards play an increasingly important role in our day-to-day live through their use in banking cards, SIM cards, electronic passports, and IoT (Internet of Things) devices. It is thus naturally of utmost importance to understand their security features and to develop sound protocols and countermeasures while keeping reasonable performances. In this respect, CARDIS aims to gather security experts from industry, academia, and standardization bodies to make steps forward in the field of embedded security.  
 The 22nd edition of CARDIS is organized by the Complex Cyber Infrastructure  group of the University of Amsterdam  in Amsterdam, NL. CARDIS 2023 will be an in-person event, with the possibility to attend talks remotely (presenters are required to participate to the conference in presence).
