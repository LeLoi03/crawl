 About the India HCI conference  

 India HCI is a premier international conference in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) that is held annually in India. It aims to positively impact and shape humanity through high-quality research in HCI and Design. The 14th international India HCI 2023 conference is hosted by the  School of Design at   UPES   in-cooperation with the  ACM  amongst Dehradun’s beautifully lush and verdant environs.   
 The conference theme is “  HCI for Enabling Creativity”  and aims to initiate dialogues, debates, and discussions that enable synergies between Creativity and HCI. We invite authors to present bold ideas and research that further expand the boundaries of HCI research.   

 HCI for Enabling Creativity  

 We live in an exciting era where new technologies have transformed how we engage and interact with people, products, services, and our environment. In the past few years, it has advanced to the point where it significantly influences the creative expression of individuals and the way we work and engage with artefacts. Advances in technology raise important and exciting questions about how to use technology to augment and foster creative activity and simultaneously challenge the very concept of creativity itself. The role of HCI and design in fostering creativity will be critical.   
 The theme of IndiaHCI 2023 encourages authors and delegates to think critically about how emerging media and technology facilitate creativity in all its forms. Using a Design lens, this theme will enable discussions that push the boundaries of creativity research in HCI by gaining a holistic understanding of how people and citizens interact with new technologies, AI, materials, and emerging media.   

 About the Conference Venue  

 India HCI 2023 is being organised by the School of Design at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES). UPES is a private university in Dehradun consisting of the School of Engineering, Computer Science, Design, Business, Law, Health Sciences & Technology, Modern Media, and Liberal Studies.
