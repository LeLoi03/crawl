 55th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC2023)    
   
 The 55th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC 2023) is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory and will be held in Orlando, Florida Tuesday, June 20 - Friday, June 23, 2023.   

 STOC Paper Submission  
 Typical but not exclusive topics of interest include algorithms and data structures, computational complexity, randomness in computing, algorithmic graph theory and combinatorics, analysis of Boolean functions, approximation algorithms, cryptography, computational learning theory, continuous and discrete optimization, economics and computation, parallel and distributed algorithms, quantum computing, algorithmic coding theory, computational geometry, computational applications of logic, algebraic computation, and computational and foundational aspects of areas such as machine learning, fairness, privacy, networks, data management, databases and computational biology. Papers that extend the reach of the theory of computing, or raise important problems that can benefit from theoretical investigation and analysis, are encouraged.
