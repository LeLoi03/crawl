 Abstract  
 This volume of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series contains the proceedings of the 42nd International Conference on Conceptual Modeling–ER 2023, held in Lisbon, during November 6–9. Throughout history, Lisbon has been a key hub for maritime endeavors, and is famous for its beautiful coastal location and delightful architecture. As the cultural, economic, educational, and political center of Portugal, the city is a magnificent example of how rich past and modern energy should be blended. Very much likewise, the ER conference is the world-leading forum for discussing the state of the art, emerging issues, and future challenges of conceptual modeling. The first ER conference was held in 1979 in Los Angeles, and then took place every two years until 1985, when the conference evolved into an annual event. Over this time, the conference has been held in 20 countries on five continents, establishing a globally connected, scientifically rigorous community of academics and practitioners. Conceptual modeling is becoming even more critical in this age of extreme dynamics and huge proliferation of data. Indeed, conceptual modeling research enables our community to not only understand but describe and analyze these complex phenomena, to facilitate the development of effective software and information systems at any scale and level of detail required and bring forward their implementation in industry and the public sector.
