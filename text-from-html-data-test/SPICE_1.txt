 What is SPICE?  
 Originally SPICE was a project funded by the European Union. The main goal of this project was to develop a counterpart to CMMI, especially focused on Small and Medium Enterprises.  
 SPICE is an abbreviation and stands for " S  oftware P  rocess I  mprovement and C  apability d E  termination". Even if software development was the main driver of the initiative at that time, the "S" in SPICE is nowadays used for the entire system development.  
 The project was very successful and finally, ISO issued the standard series ISO 15504-x to support the future development of specific standards for all kinds of domains.  
 In the meantime, most parts of this standard have been replaced by the ISO 330xx series, and we have a choice from various Process Assessment Models. The focus of SPICE has widened to all Software-based Systems and to Operation and Maintenance processes.

 Automotive SPICE ®  is a domain-specific adaption of the International Standard ISO/IEC 15504 (SPICE). The purpose of that PRM/PAM is the assessment of process capability. It is mainly used to evaluate the development processes of automotive suppliers of control units.

 intacs ®  Hardware SPICE PRM/PAM version 3.0 was created to support electronic hardware development. Its main goals were:  
 Creation of a process reference and assessment model for electronic hardware development, which is  
 Compliant with ISO/IEC 330xx and ISO/IEC15504-2 
  Aligned with Automotive SPICE | ® | 4.0 
  Aligned with ISO 26262-1:2018 2ED and ISO 26262-5:2018 2Ed 
  The HWE.1 to HWE.4 processes in the intacs ®  Hardware SPICE version 3.0 are the model extension to Automotive SPICE ®  4.0 and have some additional references to ISO 26262:2018.

 SPICE for Mechanical Engineering v2.0 PAM/PRM is designed to become the domain specific extension for Automotive SPICE ®  v4.0 for mechanical engineering. The process assessment model was completely revised and aligned with Automotive SPICE ®  4.0. In addition system-V and component-V of SPICE for Mechanical Engineering v1.x have been merged into the processes MEE:1 to MEE.5.  
 The JP-version 1.7 is the Japanese version and that there is currently no more recent version in this language. We are working on new translation.

 Data Management is the set of all methodological, conceptual, organizational, technical measures and procedures for handling the resource "data“, with the aim of introducing them into business processes with their maximum potential for use  
 This PRM/PAM defines the fundamental business processes of data management capabilities. It is intended as a “state of the art” reference for process improvement. It defines a process assessment model (PAM) for the maturity of all types of data, data management, and for organizations processing data.

 The purpose of this PRM/PAM is to provide a SPICE based Process Assessment Model for the Domain “IT Service Management”.  
 To promote & establish the application of this model in the strongly growing area of “ connected car services   ”.  
 For this purpose, we want to enhance the model with domain specific reference processes and performance indicators for area of “connected car services”.

 International SPICE Communities and Networks  
  One of our main goals is to make intacs ®  visible all over the world. We have certified assessors in many countries, so we need an efficient way to keep them up to date with all the innovations and changes and to get feedback so we can continuously improve our scheme.  
  Therefore, the Internationalization Working Group establishes contacts with companies, industry representatives and community members in all countries to promote the intacs ®  program.  
  In addition, regional representatives are appointed to act as local contacts and communicate directly with the local intacs ®  assessors.
