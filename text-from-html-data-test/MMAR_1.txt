 About MMAR

 The Conference will be a good opportunity for highlighting the new results and directions of automatic control theory, technology and applications. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
  – Identification, modelling and simulation,  
  – Signal processing,  
  – Control and systems theory,  
  – Robotics,  
  – Intelligent systems and methods,  
  – Control systems.  
 The participants of the 29th International MMAR Conference will have the opportunity to take part in the wide spectrum of categories for technical presentations, including plenary lectures, regular papers of both lecture and poster session types. We look forward to seeing our old and new friends in Poland. You are kindly invited to participate in the 29th International MMAR Conference in Miedzyzdroje, Poland.  
 We’re aware some of the authors may have objections against travelling and attending the event on-site. For those, we make it possible to participate in the conference online – presenting their papers and taking part in all sessions by means of video conference. Please choose your preferred way of participation in the registration form.  
 We still hope most of you will decide to arrive and enjoy the conference on-site.  
 See you in Międzyzdroje,
