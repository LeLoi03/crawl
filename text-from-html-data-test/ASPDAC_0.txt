  Information for Speakers in Regular Sessions and Special Sessions  
 All presenters have to attend, either in-person or online, the corresponding session to give a presentation, and to answer questions during the session.  
   
  A live Zoom will be set up for each session and the session will be recorded for on-demand requests from attendees.  
   
  A presenter can provide a pre-recorded presentation in advance for backup.  
   
  If neither a live nor a pre-recorded video presentation is given, then it will be treated as no-show and the paper will be removed from the proceedings, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore.
