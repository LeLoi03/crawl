On behalf of UD-VKU, he respectfully sent the sincere thanks to REV and the University of Danang for nominating VKU as the co-organizer of this event. VKU is one of three universities specializing in the field of ITC in Vietnam with 6,000 students, 240 lecturers and staff, 40% of whom already have doctoral degrees. Every year, 1,500 students enroll in the university in different training majors/subjects related to the field of ICT such as information technology, AI, cybersecurity, computer engineering, IoT, and embedded systems. Although UD-VKU is a newly-established university, it has been very dynamic and rapidly developed, achieving many outstanding achievements in education and research. UD-VKU is also a member of the network of Asean Consortium for Innovation and Research (ACIR), Vietnam Association for Information Processing (VAIP) and other organizations.   
 The International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications is an annual conference series, held since 2008, with two main goals being (1) promoting an international forum for science and technology exchange between Vietnamese and international scientists in electronics, communications, and related fields; and (2) attracting high quality research that contributes to the development of ICT in the host country and around the world.   
 The ATC’s 2023 conference includes a series of important and hot-debating topics related to information and communications such as semiconductor microchips, and post-5G and -6G networks. This is an open and friendly forum for scientists, scholars, and experts to discuss and share initiatives in their research experiences as well as breakthrough results in system, product, and technology development.   
   
 Dr. Doan Quang Hoan – Vice President and General Secretary of the REV Association spoke at the conference    
 Giving an introduction and congratulatory speech at the conference, Dr. Doan Quang Hoan, Vice President and General Secretary of the REV Association, highly appreciated the role and responsibility of UD-VKU in hosting the ATC’s 2023 conference, contributing to the overall success of the conference. He also confirmed the good reputation of the International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC) with many high-quality and excellent articles in scientific research on advanced communication technology.   
 The ATC’s 2023 conference is the 16th edition which attracted 151 scientific articles by more than 600 domestic and international authors and co-authors. After a serious, rigorous and thorough review process, 96 articles were selected for publication in the Conference Proceedings – ATC 2023. The full text of all these articles is posted on the database of IEEEXplore.

At the workshop, specialists in the field of semiconductor microchips and representatives of managers and tertiary training institutions had a discussion on developing human resources to design and manufacture semiconductor microchips for Vietnam under current conditions. Sharing from different perspectives of experts will help higher education institutions develop appropriate semiconductor microchips training strategies and plans that suit the current context of the country, contributing to meeting the human resource demands for this field in the coming time.   
 At the end of the ATC’s 2023 conference, the organizing Committee selected and awarded the best four articles including one on the topic of Integrated Circuit by a group of authors from universities in Vietnam, Korea, and Japan (Article entitled  Design of a Configurable Low-Noise 1-Channel Analog Front-End for EEG Signal Recording on 180nm CMOS Process   ); one on the theme of Microwave Engineering by a group of authors from Vietnam (Article entitled  Integrated Workflow for Radiated Emission Simulation in Radio Frequency Board   ); another about Wireless Communications after 5G and 6G (Special Session entitled  B5G/6G Wireless Communications   ) by a group of authors from universities in Vietnam (Article entitled  A Deep CNN Design for Secure Short-Packet Communications in WET IoT Networks with Multiple Eavesdroppers   ); and the other on the topic of Networks by a group of authors from Korea (Article entitled  Intelligent Omni Surface-Assisted Cell-Free Massive MIMO System for 6G Wireless Network   ).   
   
 Delegates and scientists took photos at the closing section    
 The International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (The ATC’s 2023 conference-16  th  edition) has once again affirmed its prestige and professional quality, serving as a bridge between domestic and international scientists who can together devote their intelligence, science and technology in the fields of electronics and communications to promote scientific development in the country and the world.
