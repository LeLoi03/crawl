 Embedded and ubiquitous computing is a paradigm that aims to provide computing and communication services to the end users all the time and everywhere. Embedded and ubiquitous computing systems are now invading every aspect of our daily life and aim to revolutionize our life much more profoundly than the electric motors or even personal computer revolution did. The emergence of this technology is the outcome of research and technological advances in a variety of areas including embedded systems, pervasive computing and communications, wireless networks, mobile computing, distributed computing and agent technologies. Embedded and pervasive computing has become a key technology in determining future research and development activities in many academic and industrial branches.  
 Among a series of highly successful International Conferences on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing (EUC), the EUC 2023 conference is the 21st edition of a forum for engineers and scientists in academia, industry, and government to address the resulting profound challenges and to present and discuss their new ideas, research results, applications and experience on all aspects of embedded and ubiquitous computing. IEEE EUC-2023 is sponsored by IEEE, IEEE Computer Society, and IEEE Technical Committee on Scalable Computing (TCSC).  
 The 2023 Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing (EUC-2023) will provide a high-profile, leading-edge forum for researchers, engineers, and practitioners to present state-of-art advances and innovations in theoretical foundations, systems, infrastructure, tools, testbeds, and applications for the EUC, as well as to identify emerging research topics and define the future.  
 Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers to EUC-2023. All accepted papers are expected to be included in IEEE Xplore and will be indexed by Engineering Index (EI). IEEE Conference Publication Services (CPS) have confirmed all the papers accepted by TrustCom-2023 and the collocated conferences BigDataSE-2023, CSE-2023, EUC-2023, iSCI-2023 will be included in one conference proceeding and it will be indexed under TrustCom only. The authors of selected best papers will be invited post conference to extend their contributions for special issues of prestigious journals to be planned in conjunction with the conference.
