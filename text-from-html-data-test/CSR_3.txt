 a***h (209)  - Feedback left by buyer.   Past month     Verified purchase     Excellent eBay experience. The product was packaged safely and arrived quickly. Item was as described, good price, and received solid communication. Good seller.    Pilgrim's Regress, Paperback by Lewis, C. S., Brand New, Free shipping in the US (#385881393727) 
  8***5 (19)  - Feedback left by buyer.   Past 6 months     Verified purchase     I didn't see a verbal description of this book as "hardcover" or paperback. Cover design and price were similar to both cover styles. I thought I'd left a question for the seller, but I may have done something wrong. The package was too small to match the hardcovers previously received so I returned it unopened. Seller was very efficient, and packaging offered excellent protection. Haven't checked to see if refund was processed.    Pogo 3 : Evidence to the Contrary: The Complete Syndicated Comic Strips, Hard... (#354953679255) 
  l***1 (1402)  - Feedback left by buyer.   Past month     Verified purchase     Great seller; seller offered for sale at a reasonable price a history book of great significance; book exactly as described; seller shipped book FAST, FREE and with tracking information, a must nowadays; great communication too; rate seller 10+++++    Diary of a Soldier: Cuba: 1895-1897, Brand New, Free shipping in the US (#355418712308) 
  r***2 (266)  - Feedback left by buyer.   Past 6 months     Verified purchase     Tarot pictured not the one received (I was sent a cheaper brand of the wrong design). Automated unrelated reply about delivery dates (?!) when I asked what happened. No response to further contact. To add further insult to injury the cards were sent from USA to UK in a paper envelope with no protection so were mangled on arrival. You can't get this deck in the UK, hence my order, so postage was expensive. So wrong deck, overpriced, late, destroyed, & terrible-to-no customer service! Yay! Avoid!!    Tarot of Marseilles, Cards, Brand New, Free shipping in the US (#364999279959) 
  t***p (1108)  - Feedback left by buyer.   Past 6 months     Verified purchase     First and foremost I did read the negative ratings and weighed that against positives and # of sales and rolled the dice on buying from Great Book Prices Store. The book Want went missing with USPS as "Undeliverable to address" so I suspected G.B.P.S. had gone dark somehow. The book arrived several days later than "scheduled" as advertised to my relief and top rating is due. With my long history with ebay I suspect (grain of salt here!) management is in asia and translation is slow. 2 cents.
