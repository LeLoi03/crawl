 49th International Workshop on Graph-Theoretic Concepts in Computer Science  

 WG conferences aim to connect theory and applications by demonstrating how graph-theoretic concepts can be applied in various areas of computer science. The goal is to present recent results and to identify and explore directions for future research. The 49th edition is organised by the University of Fribourg, Switzerland and will be held on June 28-30, 2023.  
 WG 2024 will take place in Gozd Martuljek, Slovenia. More information can be found here  .

 Aims and Scopes  
 WG is mainly concerned with efficient algorithms of various types (e.g. sequential, parallel, distributed, randomized, parameterized) for problems on graphs and networks. The goal is to present recent results and to identify and explore directions for future research. Submitted papers should describe original results in any aspects of graph theory related to computer science, including but not restricted to:  
 design and analysis of sequential, parallel, randomized, parameterized algorithms 
  distributed graph and network algorithms 
  structural graph theory with algorithmic or complexity applications 
  computational complexity of graph and network problems 
  graph grammars, graph rewriting systems and graph modeling 
  graph drawing and layouts 
  computational geometry 
  computational biology 
  graph mining 
  random graphs and models of the web and scale-free networks 
  support of the above concepts by suitable implementations and applications.

  WG Test of Time Award  
 The third WG Test of Time Award, given for a highly influential paper presented at a previous WG conference, has been given to Alistair Sinclair and Mark Jerrum for their paper “Approximate Counting, Uniform Generation and Rapidly Mixing Markov Chains” from WG 1987. The WG Test of Time Award lecture will be given by:  
   
  Mark Jerrum  , Queen Mary, University of London, United Kingdom  
  Title: 35 years of counting, sampling and mixing, Abstract   
 Best Paper and Best Student Paper  
 The WG 2023 Best Paper award has been given to Paul Jungeblut, Samuel Schneider and Torsten Ueckerdt for their paper “Cops and Robber – When Capturing is not Surrounding” and the WG 2023 Best Student Paper Award has been given to Falko Hegerfeld and Stefan Kratsch for their paper “Tight Algorithms for Connectivity Problems Parameterized by Modular-Treewidth”. Both awards are sponsored by Springer.
