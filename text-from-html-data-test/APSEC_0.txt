 30th Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference (APSEC 2023)  
   
 It has been 30 years since the establishment of the Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference (APSEC) as a leading regional conference that gathers researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to exchange knowledge and best practices in software engineering, and to address emerging challenges and solutions in software engineering innovation. This year’s APSEC will be held on December 4-7, 2023 in Seoul, Korea. APSEC 2023 will continue in the tradition of previous editions of this regional conference. As in past APSEC series, the main research track features the most recent and significant innovations in the field of software engineering and all its sub-disciplines. APSEC 2023 also invites submissions of high-quality research papers that describe original and unpublished results on theoretical and empirical software engineering research topics.  
 APSEC 2023 will offer an extensive program of interest to academia, government, and industry. It will include several distinguished keynote speakers and conference days of paper presentations and demos. A series of exciting tutorials to develop skills in various aspects of software engineering practices is of particular interest to the industry. Co-located workshops offer forums for participants to present novel techniques and methods in specific sub-disciplines of software engineering. To celebrate its 30th anniversary, APSEC 2023 will also provide special events such as APSEC’s 30th Anniversary MIPs Session, and Student Research Competition (SRC).
