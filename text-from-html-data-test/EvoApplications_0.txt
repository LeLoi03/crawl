   EvoApplications, the International Conference on the Applications of Evolutionary Computation -formerly known as EvoWorkshops- brings together researchers in applications of Evolutionary Computation and other Nature-inspired techniques.  
 EvoApplications invites high quality contributions for its 26th edition, which will be held as part of the EvoStar 2023 event and co-located within EvoStar with three related conferences: EuroGP, EvoCOP and EvoMUSART.  
 The aim of EvoApplications is to create a friendly environment that can lead to the establishment or strengthening of scientific collaborations and exchanges among attendees.  
 Therefore, EvoApplications solicits high-quality original research papers (including significant work-in-progress) on any aspect of applications of Evolutionary Computation, both to real-world or methodological contexts in which Evolutionary Computation can contribute to pushing the limits of the state of the art beyond the present ones.  
 We encourage you to submit papers focused on interesting, relevant and original works that are related to all kinds of applications of Evolutionary Computation.

  Submission Details  
 Accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of EvoApplications, published in a volume of the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science, which will be available at the Conference. Submitted papers require novel and complete research work or interesting preliminary results. Submissions must be original and not published elsewhere. The submissions will be peer reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. The reviewing process will be double-blind, so please omit information about the authors in the submitted paper  . Submit your manuscript in Springer LNCS format  and provide up to five keywords in your Abstract  
 Page limit  : 16 pages  
 Submission link  : https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=evo2023   
 The authors of accepted papers will have to improve their paper on the basis of the reviewers’ comments and will be asked to send a camera ready version of their manuscripts (notifications will be sent on 18 January, 2023  and the camera-ready deadline will be on 1 February, 2023  ). At least one author of each accepted work has to register for the conference not later than 27 February 2023,  attend the conference and present the work. All authors of accepted papers will be given the opportunity to further disseminate their work in poster sessions.
