         International Requirements Engineering Conference    Current event: RE'23, 04.09.-08.09.2023     
   
 Welcome to the community page of the RE: the premier international scientific venue in the requirements engineering field. RE conferences bring together every year on a different continent several hundreds of researchers, practitioners, educators, and students to present and discuss the most recent research results, innovations, experiences, and concerns in the discipline of requirements engineering and related areas.  
 This series started as two alternating biennial conference series. One series, in odd years starting in 1993, was the International Symposium on Requirements Engineering (RE). The other series, in even years starting in 1994, was the International Conference on Requirements Engineering (ICRE). The two series merged in 2002 with the holding of the Joint International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE'02), so named to announce the merger.  
 This web site contains general information about the conference series, links to the home pages of individual conferences, the steering committee, as well as main scientific and community awards from the past.
