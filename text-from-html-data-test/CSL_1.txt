 Computer Science Logic (CSL) is the annual conference of the European Association for Computer Science Logic (EACSL). The conference series started in 1987 as a programme of International Workshops on Computer Science Logic, and then in its sixth meeting (in 1992) became the Annual Conference of the EACSL.  
 Selected papers from CSL conferences are published in Logical Methods in Computer Science.
