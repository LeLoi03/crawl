 Overview  
 Top Research Topics at European conference on Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial Optimization?  
 Mathematical optimization (66.01%) 
  Evolutionary algorithm (29.21%) 
  Algorithm (24.44%) 
  European conference on Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial Optimization primarily focuses on research topics in Mathematical optimization, Evolutionary algorithm, Algorithm, Combinatorial optimization and Local search (optimization). The Mathematical optimization study featured in the event draws connections with the study of Benchmark (computing). Aside from discussions in Evolutionary algorithm, the event also deals with the subject of Multi-objective optimization which intersects with Pareto principle disciplines.  
 European conference on Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial Optimization features studies on Algorithm, including topics such as Travelling salesman problem. The studies in Combinatorial optimization featured incorporate elements of Theoretical computer science, Graph theory, Memetic algorithm, Solver and Search algorithm. While work presented in European conference on Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial Optimization provided substantial information on Local search (optimization), it also covered topics in Beam search, Best-first search and Vehicle routing problem.  
 It explores topics in Metaheuristic which can be helpful for research in disciplines like Ant colony optimization algorithms, Simulated annealing, Tabu search and Heuristic (computer science). The event addresses concerns in Genetic algorithm which are intertwined with other disciplines, such as Crossover and Artificial intelligence. The studies on Heuristics discussed can also contribute to research in the domains of Machine learning and Heuristic.  
 What are the most cited papers published at the conference?  
 HyFlex: a benchmark framework for cross-domain heuristic search (135 citations) 
  Balancing bicycle sharing systems: a variable neighborhood search approach (96 citations) 
  Solving the Vehicle Routing Problem by Using Cellular Genetic Algorithms (91 citations) 
  Research areas of the most cited articles at European conference on Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial Optimization:  
 The conference articles mainly deal with areas of study such as Mathematical optimization, Evolutionary algorithm, Combinatorial optimization, Algorithm and Local search (optimization). The conference papers focus on Mathematical optimization as well as the interrelated topics of Vehicle routing problem. The most cited publications focus on Evolutionary algorithm but the discussions also offer insight into other areas such as Genetic algorithm, Multi-objective optimization, Heuristic (computer science) and Benchmark (computing).  
 What topics the last edition of the conference is best known for?  
 Artificial intelligence 
  Algorithm 
  Mathematical optimization 
  The previous edition focused in particular on these issues:  
 European conference on Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial Optimization generally zeroes in on subjects such as Mathematical optimization, Heuristics, Evolutionary algorithm, Job shop scheduling and Algorithm. The studies tackled, which mainly focus on Mathematical optimization, apply to Benchmark (computing) as well. The research on Heuristics tackled can also make contributions to studies in the areas of Steiner tree problem and Heuristic.  
 The event focuses on Evolutionary algorithm but sometimes tackles the closely related topic of Mutation (genetic algorithm) which is concerned with Order (ring theory), Fitness function, Linear function (calculus), Arbitrarily large and Exponential function. The featured Job shop scheduling studies mainly concentrate on Heuristic (computer science) but also cover areas of interest in Simulated annealing, Linear programming and Ant colony optimization algorithms. The subject of Genetic programming, which is connected to the field of Algorithm configuration, serves as the foundation of the Algorithm research featured in the conference.  
 The most cited articles from the last conference are:  
 Stagnation Detection with Randomized Local Search (9 citations) 
  On Hybrid Heuristics for Steiner Trees on the Plane with Obstacles (5 citations) 
  A Cooperative Optimization Approach for Distributing Service Points in Mobility Applications (2 citations) 
  Papers citation over time  
 A key indicator for each conference is its effectiveness in reaching other researchers with the papers published at that venue.  
 The chart below presents the interquartile range (first quartile 25%, median 50% and third quartile 75%) of the number of citations of articles over time.

 Publication chance based on affiliation  
 The publication chance index shows the ratio of articles published by the best research institutions at the conference edition to all articles published within that conference. The best research institutions were selected based on the largest number of articles published during all editions of the conference.  
 The chart below presents the percentage ratio of articles from top institutions (based on their ranking of total papers).Top affiliations were grouped by their rank into the following tiers: top 1-10, top 11-20, top 21-50, and top 51+. Only articles with a recognized affiliation are considered.  

 Research.com  

 During the most recent 2021 edition, 0.00%  of publications had an unrecognized affiliation. Out of the publications with recognized affiliations, 26.67%  were posted by at least one author from the top 10 institutions publishing at the conference. Another 13.33%  included authors affiliated with research institutions from the top 11-20 affiliations. Institutions from the 21-50 range included 20.00%  of all publications and 40.00%  were from other institutions.  
 Returning Authors Index  
 A very common phenomenon observed among researchers publishing scientific articles is the intentional selection of conferences they have already attended in the past. In particular, it is worth analyzing the case when the authors participate in the same conference from year to year.  
 The Returning Authors Index presented below illustrates the ratio of authors who participated in both a given as well as the previous edition of the conference in relation to all participants in a given year.

 Returning Institution Index  
 The graph below shows the Returning Institution Index, illustrating the ratio of institutions that participated in both a given and the previous edition of the conference in relation to all affiliations present in a given year.

 The experience to innovation index  
 Our experience to innovation index was created to show a cross-section of the experience level of authors publishing at a conference. The index includes the authors publishing at the last edition of a conference  , grouped by total number of publications throughout their academic career (P) and the total number of citations of these publications ever received (C).  
 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups:  
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25), 
  Competent - P < 10 or C < 100 (the number of publications less than 10 or the number of citations less than 100), 
  Experienced - P < 25 or C < 625 (the number of publications less than 25 or the number of citations less than 625), 
  Master - P < 50 or C < 2500 (the number of publications less than 50 or the number of citations less than 2500), 
  Star - P ≥ 50 and C ≥ 2500 (both the number of publications greater than 50 and the number of citations greater than 2500). 

 The chart below illustrates experience levels of first authors in cases of publications with multiple authors.
