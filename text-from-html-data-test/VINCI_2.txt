 Overview  
 Top Research Topics at Visual Information Communication and Interaction?  
 Visualization (50.55%) 
  Human–computer interaction (25.09%) 
  Artificial intelligence (19.56%) 
  The objective of Visual Information Communication and Interaction is to combine knowledge in the areas of Visualization, Human–computer interaction, Artificial intelligence, Information visualization and Data mining. The studies on Visualization discussed can also contribute to research in the domains of World Wide Web, Information retrieval and Data science. Interactive visual analysis, User interface, Multimedia and Context (language use) are some topics wherein Human–computer interaction research discussed in it have an impact.  
 While Artificial intelligence is the focus of Visual Information Communication and Interaction, it also provided insights into the studies of Machine learning, Computer vision and Pattern recognition. The conference is mostly focused on Computer vision, specifically Image (mathematics). In addition to Information visualization research, the conference aims to explore topics under Interactive visualization, Algorithm and Computer graphics (images).  
 Most of the Visual analytics studies addressed also intersect with Analytics.  
 What are the most cited papers published at the conference?  
 VISA: a visual sentiment analysis system (21 citations) 
  A Flip-Book of Edge-Splatted Small Multiples for Visualizing Dynamic Graphs (14 citations) 
  Enhanced Hexagon-Tiling Algorithm for Map-Like Information Visualisation (14 citations) 
  Research areas of the most cited articles at Visual Information Communication and Interaction:  
 The published articles mostly deal with topics like Visualization, Information visualization, Human–computer interaction, Theoretical computer science and Readability. The studies on Visualization discussed at the published papers can also contribute to research in the domains of User interface, Multimedia and Adaptation (computer science). The conference articles facilitate discussions on Information visualization that incorporate concepts from other fields like Hierarchical database model and Data visualization.  
 What topics the last edition of the conference is best known for?  
 Artificial intelligence 
  The Internet 
  Machine learning 
  The previous edition focused in particular on these issues:  
 The conference facilitates discussions on Visualization, Artificial intelligence, Human–computer interaction, Information visualization and Visual analytics. Specifically, studies on Graph drawing are prevalent in the Visualization works discussed. The research on Artificial intelligence tackled can also make contributions to studies in the areas of Machine learning, Computer vision and Pattern recognition.  
 While work presented in the conference provided substantial information on Human–computer interaction, it also covered topics in Pipeline (software), Data visualization, Focus (computing) and Gaze. It holds forums on Information visualization that merges themes from other disciplines such as Interactive visualization, Algorithm, Disinformation and Internet privacy. The concepts on Visual analytics presented in the event can also apply to other research fields, including Tracking (particle physics), Temporal database and Snapshot (computer storage).  
 The most cited articles from the last conference are:  
 Cluster-clean-label: an interactive machine learning approach for labeling high-dimensional data (2 citations) 
  Visualization of nonlinear programming for robot motion planning (2 citations) 
  Inner-process visualization of hidden states in recurrent neural networks (1 citations) 
  Papers citation over time  
 A key indicator for each conference is its effectiveness in reaching other researchers with the papers published at that venue.  
 The chart below presents the interquartile range (first quartile 25%, median 50% and third quartile 75%) of the number of citations of articles over time.

 Publication chance based on affiliation  
 The publication chance index shows the ratio of articles published by the best research institutions at the conference edition to all articles published within that conference. The best research institutions were selected based on the largest number of articles published during all editions of the conference.  
 The chart below presents the percentage ratio of articles from top institutions (based on their ranking of total papers).Top affiliations were grouped by their rank into the following tiers: top 1-10, top 11-20, top 21-50, and top 51+. Only articles with a recognized affiliation are considered.  

 Research.com  

 During the most recent 2020 edition, 18.75%  of publications had an unrecognized affiliation. Out of the publications with recognized affiliations, 53.85%  were posted by at least one author from the top 10 institutions publishing at the conference. Another 19.23%  included authors affiliated with research institutions from the top 11-20 affiliations. Institutions from the 21-50 range included 15.38%  of all publications and 11.54%  were from other institutions.  
 Returning Authors Index  
 A very common phenomenon observed among researchers publishing scientific articles is the intentional selection of conferences they have already attended in the past. In particular, it is worth analyzing the case when the authors participate in the same conference from year to year.  
 The Returning Authors Index presented below illustrates the ratio of authors who participated in both a given as well as the previous edition of the conference in relation to all participants in a given year.

 The experience to innovation index  
 Our experience to innovation index was created to show a cross-section of the experience level of authors publishing at a conference. The index includes the authors publishing at the last edition of a conference  , grouped by total number of publications throughout their academic career (P) and the total number of citations of these publications ever received (C).  
 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups:  
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25), 
  Competent - P < 10 or C < 100 (the number of publications less than 10 or the number of citations less than 100), 
  Experienced - P < 25 or C < 625 (the number of publications less than 25 or the number of citations less than 625), 
  Master - P < 50 or C < 2500 (the number of publications less than 50 or the number of citations less than 2500), 
  Star - P ≥ 50 and C ≥ 2500 (both the number of publications greater than 50 and the number of citations greater than 2500). 

 The chart below illustrates experience levels of first authors in cases of publications with multiple authors.
