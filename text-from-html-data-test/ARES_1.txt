 About ARES 03/04   
  
 Established in 2006, the International Conference on Availability, Reliability, and Security (ARES) serves as a pivotal gathering for researchers and practitioners in IT security and privacy. This distinguished platform facilitates the exchange, discussion, and transfer of knowledge, contributing significantly to the academic discourse in the field   
 ARES annually transforms European cities into knowledge exchange hubs, spotlighting dependability's critical facets—availability, reliability, and security. Our conference serves as a forum for in-depth discussions on dependability, covering safety, confidentiality, integrity, maintainability, and security across diverse applications.  
   
  Dedicated to the scrutiny of Dependable Computing's various aspects and shaping future roadmaps, ARES is a catalyst for innovation and collaboration. Since 2015, the ARES EU Projects Symposium, held concurrently, provides a vital space for EU research projects to showcase results, forge partnerships, and engage in meaningful discourse. The symposium facilitates networking among practitioners, researchers, and experts from diverse fields, fostering valuable collaborations.  
   
  Complementing these initiatives, ARES steadfastly supports workshops held alongside the conference. Many have become integral to the ARES family, contributing to our vibrant community. In 2023, ARES hosted 14 regular workshops and 8 EU Project workshops, further enriching our commitment to advancing IT security, reliability, and collaborative exploration. Join us at ARES, where ideas converge, partnerships form, and the future of Dependable Computing unfolds.
