 Welcome to SISY 2023!  
 Authors are welcome to submit original and unpublished papers which are not currently under review by another conference or journal and addressing state-of-the-art research to share their work in all areas of Intelligent Systems and Informatics and its applications and attend the IEEE 21 st  International Symposium on Intelligent Systems and Informatics (SISY 2023)  to be held on September 21-23, 2023  in Pula, Croatia  .  
   
  Call for Papers   

 IEEE Publication  
  The conference appears on the IEEE Conference Search  .  
  Conference proceedings that meet IEEE quality review standards may be eligible for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from IEEE Xplore), if the paper is not presented at the conference. 'Pay to publish' is not allowed by IEEE. So at least one author of a paper must show up and present the paper at the conference.  
  The conference proceedings is now available via IEEE Xplore  .  
 Scope  
 The aim of SISY 2023 symposium is to offer researchers an opportunity to extend the existing scientific relationships all over the world in the field of Intelligent Systems. Our hope is that researchers and lecturers working at various institutions will find common research areas at the conference so that they can cooperate on bilateral or international projects.
