 Since its inception with the Fuse  event in 2004, the New Zealand Game Developers Conference (NZGDC) has grown into a significant gathering for industry professionals.  
 After a hiatus, the conference was revitalized in 2012 and has since featured notable speakers like Alex Amstel and Jeff Olsen. The conference has found various venues over the years, including AUT University and Te Papa, attracting renowned figures like Dave Brevik, Connie Kennedy, and Dean Hall.  
 In 2022, the NZGDC expanded it’s scope to include the screen sector, with Convergence Day welcoming the VFX and animation industries. As a platform for knowledge-sharing and community growth, the NZGDC continues to evolve, offering valuable experiences and opportunities for New Zealand’s game development scene.
