 Virtual Workshop  
 The 12 th  International Workshop on Intelligent Data Processing (IDP2023)  
 in conjunction with IEEE/WIC WI-IAT 2023  

 The 12 th  International Workshop on Intelligent Data Processing  
 Co-located with The 22 nd  IEEE/WIC International Joint Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT '23)   
 Improving data processing efficiency has attracted much attention from various research communities. Researchers in related fields are facing the challenges of data explosion, which demands enormous manpower for data processing, especially in the data-driven artificial intelligence areas. Artificial intelligence and intelligent systems offer efficient mechanisms that can significantly reduce the costs of processing large volume data and improve data processing quality. Practical applications have been developed in different areas including know-based data analysis, health informatics, big data analytics, data-driven machine learning, etc.  
 Published by IEEE  and Sponsored by IEEE/WIC  .  
 This workshop aims to gather experts and scholars from related fields to present and share their recent research on intelligent data processing. The purpose of the 12th IDP is to provide a forum for discussion and interaction among researchers with interests in the cutting-edge techniques of intelligent data processing. A special attention is given to the topics that developed in the COVID-19 period such as data-driven artificial intelligence applications, data mining, social networks, and health informatics. Participants are invited to submit papers in all areas of data- and knowledgebased approaches.
