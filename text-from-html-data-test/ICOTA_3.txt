 Handbook of global optimization  Panos Pardalos    
 2002  
 In 1995 the Handbook of Global Optimization (first volume), edited by R. Horst, and PM Pardalos, was published. This second volume of the Handbook of Global Optimization is comprised of chapters dealing with modern approaches to global optimization, including different types of heuristics. Together (available as a set, set ISBN 1-4020-0742-6), the two volumes of the handbook cover a complete and broad spectrum of approaches for dealing with global optimization problems. The goal of the editors is to provide a true handbook ...

 Advances in Global Optimization: Methods and Applications  Panos M Pardalos    
 Many deterministic minimization algorithms can be seen as discrete dynamical systems coming from the discretization of first or second order Cauchy problems. On the other hand, global optimization can be considered as an over-determined Boundary Value Problem (BVP) for these problems. For instance, the steepest descent method leads to the following BVP:

 Introduction to Global Optimization  Leo Liberti    
 2006  
 Accurate modelling of real-world problems often requires nonconvex terms to be introduced in the model, either in the objective function or in the constraints. Nonconvex programming is one of the hardest fields of optimization, presenting many challenges in both practical and theoretical aspects. The presence of multiple local minima calls for the application of global optimization techniques. This paper is a mini-course about global optimization techniques in nonconvex programming; it deals with some theoretical aspects of nonlinear programming as well as with some of the current stateof-the-art algorithms in global optimization. The syllabus is as follows. Some examples of Nonlinear Programming Problems (NLPs). General description of two-phase algorithms. Local optimization of NLPs: derivation of KKT conditions. Short notes about stochastic global multistart algorithms with a concrete example (SobolOpt). In-depth study of a deterministic spatial Branch-and-Bound algorithm, and con...

 Proceedings of the XIII Global Optimization Workshop: GOW'16  Ana Maria A.c. Rocha    
 2016  
 Large scale problems in the design of networks and energy systems, the biomedical field, finance, and engineering are modeled as optimization problems. Humans and nature are constantly optimizing to minimize costs or maximize profits, to maximize the flow in a network, or to minimize the probability of a blackout in the smart grid. Due to new algorithmic developments and the computational power of computers, optimization algorithms have been used to solve problems in a wide spectrum of applications in science and engineering. In this talk I am going to address new challenges in the theory and practice of optimization. First, we have to reflect back a few decades to see what has been achieved and then address the new research challenges and directions.

 A survey on the global optimization problem: General theory and computational approaches  Francesco Archetti    
 Annals of Operations Research, 1984  
 Several different approaches have been suggested for the numerical solution of the global optimization problem: space covering methods, trajectory methods, random sampling, random search and methods based on a stochastic model of the objective function are considered in this paper and their relative computational effectiveness is discussed. A closer analysis is performed of random sampling methods along with cluster analysis of sampled data and of Bayesian nonparametric stopping rules.
