  Theoretical computer science (19.19%) 
  Discrete mathematics, Combinatorics, Theoretical computer science, Algorithm and Time complexity are among the topics commonly tackled in the conference. The conference centers on topics in Discrete mathematics, with a focus on Decidability. The conference emphasizes research on Decidability, which includes concerns such as Undecidable problem.  
 The work on Combinatorics addressed in the conference expands to the thematically related Upper and lower bounds. Research on Theoretical computer science addressed in the conference frequently intersections with the field of Programming language.  
 What are the most cited papers published at the conference?  
 Model Checking of Probabalistic and Nondeterministic Systems (569 citations) 
  On reduction-based process semantics (284 citations) 
  Data Provenance: Some Basic Issues (195 citations) 
  Research areas of the most cited articles at Foundations of Software Technology and Theoretical Computer Science:  
 The conference papers facilitate discussions on Theoretical computer science, Discrete mathematics, Algorithm, Combinatorics and Programming language. The most cited papers hold forums on Theoretical computer science that merge themes from other disciplines such as Modal logic and Artificial intelligence. While work presented in the most cited articles provide substantial information on Discrete mathematics, it also covers topics in Polynomial and Pushdown automaton.  
 What topics the last edition of the conference is best known for?  
 Discrete mathematics 
  Combinatorics 
  Algorithm 
  The previous edition focused in particular on these issues:  
 Foundations of Software Technology and Theoretical Computer Science is mainly concerned with subjects like Discrete mathematics, Combinatorics, Theoretical computer science, Algorithm and Programming language. Foundations of Software Technology and Theoretical Computer Science facilitates discussions on Discrete mathematics that incorporate concepts from other fields like Automaton, Bounded function and Set (abstract data type). The Combinatorics works featured in the event incorporate elements from Upper and lower bounds and Polynomial.  
 Theoretical computer science research is the primary subject tackled in it with a focus on Model checking. The Decidability works, particularly on Undecidable problem are tackled in it.  
 The most cited articles from the last conference are:  
 Model Checking of Probabalistic and Nondeterministic Systems (569 citations) 
  On reduction-based process semantics (284 citations) 
  Data Provenance: Some Basic Issues (195 citations) 
  Papers citation over time  
 A key indicator for each conference is its effectiveness in reaching other researchers with the papers published at that venue.  
 The chart below presents the interquartile range (first quartile 25%, median 50% and third quartile 75%) of the number of citations of articles over time.

 Publication chance based on affiliation  
 The publication chance index shows the ratio of articles published by the best research institutions at the conference edition to all articles published within that conference. The best research institutions were selected based on the largest number of articles published during all editions of the conference.  
 The chart below presents the percentage ratio of articles from top institutions (based on their ranking of total papers).Top affiliations were grouped by their rank into the following tiers: top 1-10, top 11-20, top 21-50, and top 51+. Only articles with a recognized affiliation are considered.  

 Research.com  

 During the most recent 2015 edition, 10.42%  of publications had an unrecognized affiliation. Out of the publications with recognized affiliations, 32.56%  were posted by at least one author from the top 10 institutions publishing at the conference. Another 25.58%  included authors affiliated with research institutions from the top 11-20 affiliations. Institutions from the 21-50 range included 18.60%  of all publications and 23.26%  were from other institutions.  
 Returning Authors Index  
 A very common phenomenon observed among researchers publishing scientific articles is the intentional selection of conferences they have already attended in the past. In particular, it is worth analyzing the case when the authors participate in the same conference from year to year.  
 The Returning Authors Index presented below illustrates the ratio of authors who participated in both a given as well as the previous edition of the conference in relation to all participants in a given year.

 Returning Institution Index  
 The graph below shows the Returning Institution Index, illustrating the ratio of institutions that participated in both a given and the previous edition of the conference in relation to all affiliations present in a given year.

 The experience to innovation index  
 Our experience to innovation index was created to show a cross-section of the experience level of authors publishing at a conference. The index includes the authors publishing at the last edition of a conference  , grouped by total number of publications throughout their academic career (P) and the total number of citations of these publications ever received (C).  
 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups:  
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25), 
  Competent - P < 10 or C < 100 (the number of publications less than 10 or the number of citations less than 100), 
  Experienced - P < 25 or C < 625 (the number of publications less than 25 or the number of citations less than 625), 
  Master - P < 50 or C < 2500 (the number of publications less than 50 or the number of citations less than 2500), 
  Star - P ≥ 50 and C ≥ 2500 (both the number of publications greater than 50 and the number of citations greater than 2500). 

 The chart below illustrates experience levels of first authors in cases of publications with multiple authors.
