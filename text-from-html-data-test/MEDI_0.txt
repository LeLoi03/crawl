 Overview  
 The Twelfth International Conference on Model & Data Engineering (MEDI) will be held from 2 to 4 November 2023 in Sousse, Tunisia. Its main objective is to provide a forum for the dissemination of research accomplishments and to promote the interaction and collaboration between the models and data research communities. MEDI 2023 provides an international platform for the presentation of research on models and data theory, development of advanced technologies related to models and data and their advanced applications. This international scientific event, initiated by researchers from Euro-Mediterranean countries, aims also at promoting the creation of north-south scientific networks, projects and faculty/student exchanges.  
   
 Why Sousse?  
  Sousse or Soussa (Berber origin) is a city located in northeastern Tunisia. It is the capital of the Sousse Governorate. Located 140 km south of the capital Tunis on the Gulf of Hammamet, the city has 280 000 inhabitants. The present city has grown to include the ruins of Hadrumetum, which had many names in several languages during antiquity. Its economy is based on transport equipment, processed food, olive oil, textiles and tourism.  
 The city is host to many international conferences and other important regional and international events. We have chosen Sousse to host the MEDI-2023 for its exoticism and modernity. The facilities for hosting conferences in the city have evolved, especially in terms of hotels and conference centers.  
  
 Medi 2023 will be Organized in Hotel Sousse Pearl Marriott Resort & Spa 5*  , Sousse- Tunisia  
 Sousse Pearl Marriott Resort & Spa is conveniently located within walking distance (01 Km) of the city's oldest area. It is also just a few steps away from all the main tourist attractions.
