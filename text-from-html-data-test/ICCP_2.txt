  Scope:The goal of the 2023 IEEE 19th International Conference on Intelligent Computer Communication and Processing is to bring together researchers, engineers and practitioners working towards improving the power of both communication and processing software using the most advanced intelligent methods available today. The growing toolkit of AI - computer vision, natural conversation, and machines that learn over time—has the potential to enhance almost the entire economic and social life. The driving forces of this development are the increased volumes of data, the continuously growing of communication, processing, storage capabilities and the new machine learning techniques especially deep learning and reinforcement learning algorithms. The fast development of artificial intelligence and its applications implies more advanced but also more secure artifacts, which require the intelligent computer communication and processing technologies to improve at a high pace.
