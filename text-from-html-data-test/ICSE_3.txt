  Recent years have witnessed an explosive growth of works on automated program repair in various scientific communities including software engineering, programming languages, formal methods and artificial intelligence. This growth has culminated in successful deployments of program repair in industry. Despite these considerable advances, program repair still faces fundamental technological and societal challenges. This workshop will create an opportunity for the research community to coordinate its effort for addressing these challenges, share recent ideas and results, and formulate an agenda for future research. Please refer to our website at https://program-repair.org/workshop-2023/

 Call for Papers  
  
 We invite submissions that discuss recent developments in the theory and practice of automated program repair. The workshop will provide an opportunity for researchers interested in program repair to exchange ideas and find out about current research directions in the field. A particular emphasis of this workshop is on reducing the gap between academic research on automated program repair and the demands of industry.  
 This workshop will explore topics related to:  
 Quality of automatically generated patches, overfitting analysis Scalability of program repair algorithms Repair of domain-specific bugs Applications of program repair Deployment of program repair Case studies on program repair Program repair tools Program repair benchmarks Dynamic and static analysis for program repair Machine learning of code for program repair Testing and verification for program repair Fault localization for program repair Program repair and DevOps Debugging and program repair Program synthesis for program repair Evaluation Criteria Reviewers will evaluate each contribution for its soundness, significance, novelty, verifiability, and clarity. Submissions should clearly state how they are novel and how they improve upon existing work.  
 We will employ a double-blind review process. Thus, no submission may reveal its authors’ identities. The authors must make every effort to honor the double-blind review process. In particular, the authors’ names must be omitted from the submission and references to their prior work should be in the third person.  
 Submission Instructions All submissions must conform to the ICSE 2023 formatting and submission instructions. All submissions must be in PDF. We invite submissions of papers of the following types:  
 Research papers (8 pages inc. references): technical research, experience reports, empirical studies, etc. Position papers (2 pages inc. references): well-argued position or work in progress. Submissions must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options).  
 Submissions can be made via the submission site ( https://apr23.hotcrp.com/  ) by the submission deadline. We encourage the authors to upload their paper info early (and can submit the PDF later) to properly enter conflicts for double-blind reviewing. If a submission is accepted, at least one author of the paper is required to attend the workshop and present the paper in person.  
 The official publication date of the workshop proceedings is the date the proceedings are made available by IEEE. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of ICSE 2023. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.
