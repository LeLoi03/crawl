  Lightning Talks 
  The Haskell Implementors’ Workshop is a forum for those involved in implementing Haskell systems, infrastructure, libraries and tools, for people generally involved in implementing Haskell technology. We share our work and discuss future directions and collaborations with others.  
 In 2023, the Haskell Implementors’ Workshop will be co-located with ICFP 2023.  
 The workshop does not have proceedings. Talks and/or demos are proposed by submitting an abstract and selected by a small program committee. The workshop will be informal and interactive, with a flexible timetable and plenty of room for ad-hoc discussion, demos, and impromptu short talks.  
 Remote presentation policy   
 Authors are strongly encouraged to present their work in-person, but may present it remotely if in-person attendance is not possible. In either case the author presenting the work must register for the workshop. Registration for remote participation is significantly cheaper and covers the whole conference. If you are unable to attend in-person or have other scheduling constraints, then please let the workshop organisers know ASAP so that we can take this into account when putting together the schedule.

 Time Band   
   
 By setting a time band, the program will dim events that are outside this time window. This is useful for (virtual) conferences with a continuous program (with repeated sessions).  
  The time band will also limit the events that are included in the personal iCalendar subscription service.   Display full program    Specify a time band   -

 Call for Talks  
  
 The 15th Haskell Implementors’ Workshop is to be held alongside ICFP 2023 this year in Seattle. It is a forum for people involved in the design and development of Haskell implementations, tools, libraries, and supporting infrastructure to share their work and to discuss future directions and collaborations with others.  
 Talks and/or demos are proposed by submitting an abstract, and selected by a small program committee. There will be no published proceedings. The workshop will be informal and interactive, with open spaces in the timetable and room for ad-hoc discussion, demos, and lightning talks.  
 Scope and Target Audience   
 It is important to distinguish the Haskell Implementors’ Workshop from the Haskell Symposium which is also co-located with ICFP 2023. The Haskell Symposium is for the publication of Haskell-related research. In contrast, the Haskell Implementors’ Workshop will have no proceedings – although we will aim to make talk videos, slides, and presented data available with the consent of the speakers.  
 The Implementors’ Workshop is an ideal place to describe a Haskell extension, describe works-in-progress, demo a new Haskell-related tool, or even propose future lines of Haskell development. Members of the wider Haskell community are encouraged to attend the workshop – we need your feedback to keep the Haskell ecosystem thriving. Students working with Haskell are especially encouraged to share their work.  
 The scope covers any of the following topics. There may be some topics that people feel we’ve missed, so by all means submit a proposal even if it doesn’t fit exactly into one of these buckets:  
 Compilation techniques 
  Language features and extensions 
  Type system implementation 
  Concurrency and parallelism: language design and implementation 
  Performance, optimization and benchmarking 
  Virtual machines and run-time systems 
  Libraries and tools for development or deployment 
  Talks   
 We invite proposals from potential speakers for talks and demonstrations. We are aiming for 20-minute talks with 5 minutes for questions and changeovers. We want to hear from people writing compilers, tools, or libraries, people with cool ideas for directions in which we should take the platform, proposals for new features to be implemented, and half-baked crazy ideas. Please submit a talk title and abstract of no more than 300 words.  
 Submissions can be made via HotCRP at https://icfp-hiw2023.hotcrp.com  until July 16 (anywhere on earth).  
 We will also have a lightning talks session. These have been very well received in recent years, and we aim to increase the time available to them. Lightning talks should be ~7mins and are scheduled on the day of the workshop. Suggested topics for lightning talks are to present a single idea, a work-in-progress project, a problem to intrigue and perplex Haskell implementors, or simply to ask for feedback and collaborators.  

 Lightning Talks  
  
 We have a number of slots for lightning talks. Lightning talks will be ~7 minutes and are scheduled on the day of the workshop. Suggested topics for lightning talks are to present a single idea, a work-in-progress project, a problem to intrigue and perplex Haskell implementors, or simply to ask for feedback and collaborators.  
 Lightning talks are proposed by submitting a title and an abstract. Submissions will not be part of the peer-review process. Notification of acceptance will be continuous until slots are full. Accepted lightning talks will be posted on the workshop’s website.  
 Submissions should be made via this Google form: https://forms.gle/2jGceompwNghbRQR9   
 Accepted lightning talks will be posted on the workshop’s website.
