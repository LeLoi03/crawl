 EuroVA 2014  
 EuroVA 2014 is the fifth international Eurovis workshop on Visual Analytics held in Europe and aims at continuing the success of the previous editions, held in Bordeaux, France, in Bergen, Norway, in Vienna, Austria and in Leipzig, Germany. Also this year the goal of the workshop is to promote and advance the combination and integration of visualization and analytics methods for the purpose of problem solving in a variety of application domains including engineering, business, public policy, biology and medicine, security, etc. EuroVA will be held on June 9th-10th, 2014 in Swansea  , as a workshop of the annual EuroVis 2014 Conference.  
 The EuroVA 2014 program will include a keynote talk and short paper presentations. Visual Analytics is the science of analytical reasoning supported by interactive visual techniques, which requires interdisciplinary science integrating techniques from visualization and computer graphics, statistics and mathematics, data management and knowledge representation, data analysis and machine learning, cognitive and perceptual sciences, and more.  
 TOPICS  of interest include but are not limited to:  
  * Visual analysis processes and workflows  
  * Visual representations and interaction techniques  
  * Data management and knowledge representation  
  * Data analysis and machine learning  
  * Cognitive and perceptual aspects  
  * Infrastructure  
  * Evaluation  
  * Applications, as far as they are strictly related to visual analytics.
