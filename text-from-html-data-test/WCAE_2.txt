 Workshop on Computer Architecture Education: Early decision deadline approaching  

 Workshop on Computer  
  Architecture Education   
 http://go.ncsu.edu/wcae2023    
 Associated with the 50th International Symposium on Computer Architecture  
  a constituent conference of the Federated Computing Research Conference  
  Orlando, FL  
  June 17, 2023   
  
  Submission deadline, May 22. Submit by May 1 to receive a decision by May 18, the early registration deadline!   

 WCAE provides a forum for educators in computer architecture to discuss  
  and share their experiences and teaching philosophy. Past WCAEs have been held  
  in conjunction with HPCA, ISCA, and Micro. Over 230 papers on computer  
  architecture education have been presented at the workshop since its inception  
  in 1995. Participants will come away from the workshop with new ideas on  
  delivering courses in computer architecture.   
   
 “Nifty Assignments” session   
 We are adding a “nifty assignments” session to this year’s workshop. This  
  session allows you to share your favorite assignments with attendees and  
  others. The materials submitted should be detailed enough so that  
  other instructors could use them to construct assignments for their own  
  courses, but not detailed enough that someone could re-use a submission to your  
  assignment as a submission to another instructor’s assignment based on your  
  materials.   
 Ideas for nifty assignments should be emailed to the organizer (efg@ncsu.edu) rather than submitted through EasyChair  .
