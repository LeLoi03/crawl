 15 th  International Workshop on Computational Optimization (WCO'22)  
 Sofia, Bulgaria, 4 - 7 September, 2022  
 Committee   
 Best Paper Award - Past Winners   
 Many real world problems arising in engineering, economics, medicine and other domains can be formulated as optimization tasks. These problems are frequently characterized by non-convex, non-differentiable, discontinuous, noisy or dynamic objective functions and constraints which ask for adequate computational methods.  
 The aim of this workshop is to stimulate the communication between researchers working on different fields of optimization and practitioners who need reliable and efficient computational optimization methods.  
 We invite original contributions related to both theoretical and practical aspects of optimization methods.  
 Topics  
 The list of topics includes, but is not limited to:  
 combinatorial and continuous global optimization 
  unconstrained and constrained optimization 
  multiobjective and robust optimization 
  optimization in dynamic and/or noisy environments 
  optimization on graphs 
  large-scale optimization, in parallel and distributed computational environments 
  meta-heuristics for optimization, nature-inspired approaches and any other derivative-free methods 
  exact/heuristic hybrid methods, involving natural computing techniques and other global and local optimization methods 
  numerical and heuristic methods for modeling 
  The applications of interest are included in the list below, but are not limited to:   
 classical operational research problems (knapsack, traveling salesman, etc) 
  computational biology and distance geometry 
  data mining and knowledge discovery 
  human motion simulations; crowd simulations 
  industrial applications 
  optimization in statistics, econometrics, finance, physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, and engineering 
  environment modeling and optimization 
  Best Paper Award  
 The best WCO'22 paper will be awarded during the social dinner of FedCSIS 2022.   
 The best paper will be selected by WCO'22 co-Chairs by taking into consideration the scores suggested by the reviewers, as well as the quality of the given oral presentation.   
 Paper submission
