 The IEEE Intelligent Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI)  , sponsored by the IEEE ITS Society, is the leading international scientific conference on interdisciplinary research on information technology for intelligence, safety, and security. Over the years, the conference has evolved from its traditional orientation of intelligence and security domain towards a more integrated alignment of multiple domains, including technology, humans, organization, and security. The scientific community has increasingly recognized the need to address intelligence and security threats by understanding the interrelationships between these different components, and by integrating recent advances from different domains.
