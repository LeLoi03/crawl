   The 23rd European Conference on Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial Optimisation is a multidisciplinary conference that brings together researchers working on applications and theory of evolutionary computation methods and other metaheuristics for solving difficult combinatorial optimisation problems appearing in various industrial, economic, and scientific domains.  
 Successfully solved problems include, but are not limited to, multi-objective, uncertain, dynamic and stochastic problems in the context of scheduling, timetabling, network design, transportation and distribution, vehicle routing, stringology, graphs, satisfiability, energy optimisation, cutting, packing, planning and search-based software engineering.  
 The EvoCOP 2023 conference will be held together with EuroGP (the 26th European Conference on Genetic Programming), EvoMUSART (the 12th European conference on evolutionary and biologically inspired music, sound, art and design) and EvoApplications (the 26th European Conference on the Applications of Evolutionary Computation), in a joint event collectively known as EvoStar (Evo*).  
 Accepted papers will be published by Springer Nature in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Previous proceedings can be found in the EvoCOP Conference Proceedings in SpringerLink  .

  Areas of Interest and Contributions   
 EvoCOP welcomes submissions in all experimental and theoretical aspects of evolutionary computation and other metaheuristics to combinatorial optimisation problems, including (but not limited to) the following areas:  
 Applications of metaheuristics to combinatorial optimization problems 
  Theoretical developments 
  Neighbourhoods and efficient algorithms for searching them 
  Variation operators for stochastic search methods 
  Constraint-handling techniques 
  Parallelisation and grid computing 
  Search space and landscape analyses 
  Comparisons between different (also exact) methods 
  Automatic algorithm configuration and design 
  Prominent examples of metaheuristics include (but are not limited to):  
 Evolutionary algorithms 
  Estimation of distribution algorithms 
  Swarm intelligence methods such as ant colony and particle swarm optimisation 
  Artificial immune systems 
  Local search methods such as simulated annealing, tabu search, variable neighbourhood search, iterated local search, scatter search and path relinking 
  Hybrid methods such as memetic algorithms 
  Matheuristics (hybrids of exact and heuristic methods) 
  Hyper-heuristics and autonomous search 
  Surrogate-model-based methods 
  Notice that, by tradition, continuous/numerical optimisation is *not* part of the topics of interest of EvoCOP. Interested authors might consider submitting to other EvoStar conferences such as EvoApplications.  
 Submission Details  
 Paper submissions must be original and not published elsewhere. The submissions will be peer reviewed by members of the program committee. The reviewing process will be double-blind, please omit information about the authors in the submitted paper  . Submit your manuscript in Springer LNCS format  .  
 Page limit:  16 pages  
 Submission link:  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=evo2023   
 The authors of accepted papers will have to improve their paper on the The authors of accepted papers will have to improve their paper on the basis of the reviewers’ comments and will be asked to send a camera ready version of their manuscripts (notifications will be sent on 18 January, 2023  and the camera-ready deadline will be on 1 February, 2023  ). At least one author of each accepted work has to register for the conference not later than 27 February 2023  , attend the conference and present the work.
