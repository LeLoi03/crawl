 The 16th IEEE Malaysia International Conference on Communications 2023 (MICC 2023) is fully sponsored by IEEE Malaysia Communication Society & Vehicular Technology Society Joint Chapter  ( ComSoc / VTS  ) will be held on the 10-12 December 2023. The conference will be held at Concorde Hotel Kuala Lumpur.   
  
 MICC celebrates its 30th anniversary, from 1993 to 2023. Join us in commemorating this milestone!   
  
  MICC has since been organized biennially, a few times in collaboration with other major conferences. In 1997, MICC was held in conjunction with IEEE 5th International Workshop on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communications Systems (ISPACS’97). In 2003 it was co-organized with IEEE 9th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communication (APCC03) and in 2005, the 7th MICC was organized in conjunction with IEEE 13th International Conference on Networks (ICON05). The 8th MICC in 2007 was co-hosted with the 14th International Conference on Telecommunications (ITC07). Next, the 9th MICC in 2009 was held in Kuala Lumpur. The latest, the 10th MICC in 2011 was held in Kota Kinabalu that was collocated with the 17th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC 2011). The 11th MICC2013 was held at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and we have celebrated 20th year celebration of this conference. MICC conferences have been very well attended and supported by researchers from Asia-Pacific region and the world at large. The 12th MICC2015 and 13 th  MICC2017 was successfully held in Kuching, Sarawak and Johor Bahru, Johor and the 14th MICC2019 was held in Hotel Bangi-Putrajaya, Selangor. Finally, the 15th MICC2021 was held virtually due to Covid-19 pandemic.
