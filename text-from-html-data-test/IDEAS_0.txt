 About IDEAS 2023    

 The aim of the IDEAS-II series of symposiums is to address the engineered and application  aspects of data regardless of the database models.  
 The symposium provides an international forum for discussion of the problems of engineering data drivend systems involving not only database technology but the related areas of artfical inteligence, communication, information retrieval, human machine interface, multimedia, NLP, privacy, security and others. The goal of IDEAS is to foster closer interaction among the industrial, research and user communities and provides an excellent opportunity for them to meet, discuss ideas, examine the current ones and develop new solutions and research directions. Along with the technical sessions, the symposium also features prominent invited speakers.  
 IDEAS series of symposiums are scheduled annually and have been held since 1997 in North America, Europe and Asia. It has attracted participants from governmental and non-governmental agencies, industries, and academia to exchange ideas and share experiences.  
 The conference proceedings will be published by the Association for Computing Machinery in their ACM Digital Library  
 Organized by   
 Open University of Cyprus  
  University of Pau and the Adour Region  
  SIGAPPFR.org,  
  Concordia University, Montreal, Canada  
  with the cooperation of ACM, BytePress and ConfSys  
 Participation Modes   
 We are glad to announce that IDEAS will be back to an in-person conference! We look forward to welcoming the participants to Crete. However, we will keep monitoring the situation of the pandemic to decide later if remote participation would be possible for those having travel restrictions.
