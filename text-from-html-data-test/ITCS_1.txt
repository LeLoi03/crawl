   About DROPS  
 Schloss Dagstuhl - Leibniz Center for Informatics has been operating the Dagstuhl Research Online Publication Server (short: DROPS) since 2004. DROPS enables publication of the latest research findings in a fast, uncomplicated manner, in addition to providing unimpeded, open access to them. All the requisite metadata on each publication is administered in accordance with general guidelines pertaining to online publications (cf. Dublin Core). This enables the online publications to be authorized for citation and made accessible to a wide readership on a permanent basis. Access is free of charge for readers following the open access idea which fosters unimpeded access to scientific publications.
