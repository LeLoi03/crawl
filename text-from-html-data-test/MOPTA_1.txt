    Dear Friends and Colleagues,    
   
   We are excited to announce that the  Modeling and Optimization: Theory and Applications (MOPTA) 2023   Conference will take place on August 16-18, 2023   at Lehigh University  , Bethlehem, PA (USA).   
   
   MOPTA conferences bring together a diverse group of researchers from  both discrete and continuous optimization  , working on  both theoretical and applied aspects  . There will be  invited plenary talks from distinguished speakers  as well as organized sessions   and  contributed talks  , spread over three days. Our goal is to present a diverse set of exciting new developments from different optimization areas while at the same time providing a setting that will allow increased interaction among the participants. Information about important deadlines and the 15th AIMMS-MOPTA Optimization Modeling Competition will be made available later this year.   
   
   The list of distinguished plenary speakers  who have already confirmed their participation includes Laura Albert (University of Wisconsin-Madison), Omar Ghattas (University of Texas at Austin), Fatma  Kılınç-Karzan (Carnegie Mellon University), Xiaodi Wu (University of Maryland), and Wotao Yin  (Alibaba Group US  )  .

   We look forward to seeing you at MOPTA 2023!
