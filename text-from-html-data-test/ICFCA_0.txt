 ICFCA 2023, International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis  
   
 July 17-21, 2023, Kassel (Germany)  
 Aims  
 The ICFCA conference series is the major biennial event of the Formal Concept Analysis research community. The 17th International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis, ICFCA 2023, aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working on both theoretical and practical aspects of Formal Concept Analysis, as well as its applications in various application fields like data mining, machine learning, software engineering, semantic web, social and environmental sciences.  
 Formal Concept Analysis emerged in the 1980â€™s from attempts to restructure lattice theory in order to promote better communication between lattice theorists and potential users of lattice theory. Since its early years, Formal Concept Analysis has developed into a research field in its own right with a thriving theoretical community and a rapidly expanding range of applications in information and knowledge processing including visualization, data analysis (mining) and knowledge management and discovery.  
 ICFCA 2023 will be hosted at the University of Kassel. It will be a hybrid conference with a strong emphasis on on-site interaction.
