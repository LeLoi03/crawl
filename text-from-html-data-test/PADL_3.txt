 Declarative languages comprise several well-established classes of formalisms, namely, functional, logic, and constraint programming. Such formalisms enjoy both sound theoretical bases and the availability of attractive frameworks for application development. Indeed, they have been already successfully applied to many different real-world situations, ranging from database management to active networks to software engineering to decision support systems. New developments in theory and implementation fostered applications in new areas. At the same time, applications of declarative languages to novel and challenging problems raise many interesting research issues, including designing for scalability, language extensions for application deployment, and programming environments. Thus, applications drive the progress in the theory and implementation of declarative systems, and benefit from this progress as well. PADL is a well-established forum for researchers and practitioners to present original work emphasizing novel applications and implementation techniques for all forms of declarative programming, including functional and logic programming, database and constraint programming, and theorem proving. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: Innovative applications of declarative languages Declarative domain-specific languages and applications Practical applications of theoretical results New language developments and their impact on applications Declarative languages and software engineering Evaluation of implementation techniques on practical applications Practical experiences and industrial applications Novel uses of declarative languages in the classroom Practical extensions such as constraint-based, probabilistic, and reactive languages PADL 2025 especially welcomes new ideas and approaches related to applications, design and implementation of declarative languages going beyond the scope of the past PADL symposia, for example, advanced database languages and contract languages, as well as verification and theorem proving methods that rely on declarative languages. PADL 2025 will take place on January 20th and 21st, 2025, as a physical (in-person) event. For each accepted paper at least one author is required to register for the conference and present the paper in person. PADL 2025 encourages students to participate in the symposium by providing some student grants to partially cover the registration and travel costs. The selection process will give preference to students who present their paper in the symposium. Students from underrepresented groups are strongly encouraged to apply.
