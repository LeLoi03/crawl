 About the Conference  
 This is the conference of the  SIAM Activity Group on Discrete Mathematics  .  
    The SIAM Conference on Discrete Mathematics (DM24) is being held jointly with:  
  SIAM Annual Meeting (AN24)   
  SIAM Conference on Applied Mathematics Education (ED24)   
 Discrete mathematics has a wide range of challenging research problems and important applications in industry. In addition to core combinatorial problems and techniques, modern research in the field encompasses approaches from many other areas of mathematics including algebra, topology, geometry, probability, analysis and logic. Its applications span computer science, the physical, biological, and social sciences, telecommunications, information processing, and manufacturing, and it is widely used by businesses and industries to improve efficiency. This conference will highlight major theoretical advances in discrete mathematics, the development of new tools and techniques, and significant new applications to problems from industry and science. It will also bring together participants from the many different environments where discrete mathematics is developed and applied.  

 Included Themes  
 Discrete Mathematics, including:  
 Algebraic combinatorics 
  Combinatorial algorithms 
  Combinatorial number theory 
  Design theory
