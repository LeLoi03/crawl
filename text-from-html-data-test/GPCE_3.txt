  Call for Papers 
  The two-day program of GPCE 2022 is over. Thank you very much to all attendees and contributors. The proceedings are available on ACM Digital Library. URL: https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.1145/3564719   
 ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts & Experiences (GPCE) is a venue for researchers and practitioners interested in techniques that use program generation, domain-specific languages, and component deployment to increase programmer productivity, improve software quality, and shorten the time-to-market of software products. In addition to exploring cutting-edge techniques of generative software, our goal is to foster further cross-fertilization between the software engineering and the programming languages research communities.  
 Generative and component approaches and domain-specific abstractions are revolutionizing software development just as automation and componentization revolutionized manufacturing. Raising the level of abstraction in software specification has been a fundamental goal of the computing community for several decades. Key technologies for automating program development and lifting the abstraction level closer to the problem domain are Generative Programming for program synthesis, Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) for compact problem-oriented programming notations, and corresponding Implementation Technologies aiming at modularity, correctness, reuse, and evolution. As the field matures Applications and Empirical Results are of increasing importance.  
 GPCE 2022 will be co-located with SPLASH, APLAS, DLS, SAS, and SLE. The conference will be hosted in Auckland, New Zealand. Any author who cannot travel is allowed to “Zoom in” during the allocated slot.

 Call for Papers  
  
 The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts & Experiences (GPCE) is a programming languages conference focusing on techniques and tools for code generation, language implementation, and product-line development.  
 GPCE seeks conceptual, theoretical, empirical, and technical contributions to its topics of interest, which include but are not limited to:  
 program transformation, staging, macro systems, preprocessors, program synthesis, and code-recommendation systems, 
  domain-specific languages, language embedding, language design, and language workbenches, 
  feature-oriented programming, domain engineering, and feature interactions, 
  applications and properties of code generation, language implementation, and product-line development. 
  GPCE promotes cross-fertilization between programming languages and software development and among different styles of generative programming in its broadest sense.  
 Authors are welcome to check with the PC chair whether their planned papers are in scope.  
  Paper Categories   
 GPCE solicits three kinds of submissions:  
 Full Papers  reporting original and unpublished results of research that contribute to scientific knowledge for any GPCE topics. Full paper submissions must not exceed 12 pages excluding the bibliography. 
  Short Papers  presenting unconventional ideas or new visions in any GPCE topics. Short papers do not always contain complete results as in the case of full papers, but can introduce new ideas to the community and get early feedback. Note that short papers are not intended to be position statements. Accepted short papers are included in the proceedings and will be presented at the conference. Short paper submissions must not exceed 6 pages excluding the bibliography, and must have the text “(Short Paper)” appended to their titles. 
  Tool Demonstrations  presenting tools for any GPCE topics. Tools must be available for use and must not be purely commercial. Submissions must provide a tool description not exceeding 6 pages excluding bibliography and a separate demonstration outline including screenshots also not exceeding 6 pages. Tool demonstration submissions must have the text “(Tool Demonstration)” appended to their titles. If they are accepted, tool descriptions will be included in the proceedings. The demonstration outline will only be used for evaluating the submission. 
   Paper Selection   
 The GPCE program committee will evaluate each submission according to the following selection criteria:  
 Novelty. Papers must present new ideas or evidence and place them appropriately within the context established by previous research in the field. 
  Significance. The results in the paper must have the potential to add to the state of the art or practice in significant ways. 
  Evidence. The paper must present evidence supporting its claims. Examples of evidence include formalizations and proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, and case studies. 
  Clarity. The paper must present its contributions and results clearly. 
   Best Paper Award   
 Following the tradition, the GPCE 2022 program committee will select the best paper among accepted papers. The authors of the best paper will be given the best paper award at the conference.  
  Paper Submission   
 Papers must be submitted using HotCRP: https://gpce2022.hotcrp.com/   
 All submissions must use the ACM SIGPLAN Conference Format “acmart”  . Be sure to use the latest LaTeX templates and class files  , the SIGPLAN sub-format, and 10-point font. Consult the sample-sigplan.tex  template and use the document-class \documentclass[sigplan,anonymous,review]{acmart}  .  
 To increase fairness in reviewing, GPCE 2022 uses the double-blind review process  which has become standard across SIGPLAN conferences:  
 Author names, institutions, and acknowledgments should be omitted from submitted papers, and 
  references to the authors’ own work should be in the third person. 
  No other changes are necessary, and authors will not be penalized if reviewers are able to infer authors’ identities in implicit ways.  
 For additional information, clarification, or answers to questions, contact the program chair: kameyama (at) acm.org  
  Authors Take Note   
 The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. Papers must describe work not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by the SIGPLAN Republication Policy  . Authors should be aware that ACM has a strict policy with regard to plagiarism and self-plagiarism as described by the ACM Policy on Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and Falsification  .

 Title: Language Design meets Verifying Compilers  
 Date: December 6th, 2022  
 Abstract: The dream of developing compilers that automatically verify whether programs meet their specifications remains an ongoing challenge.  
 Such ``verifying compilers'' are (finally) on the verge of entering mainstream software development. This is partly due to advancements made over the last few decades but also the increasingly significant and complex role software plays in the modern world. As computer scientists, we should encourage this transition and help relegate many forms of software errors to the history books. One way of increasing adoption is to design languages around these tools, which look, on the surface, like regular programming languages. That is, to seamlessly integrate specification and verification and offer something that, for the everyday programmer, appears as nothing more than glorified type checking. This requires, amongst other things, careful consideration as to which language features mesh well with verification and which do not. The design space here is interesting and subtle but has been largely overlooked. In this talk, I will attempt to shed light on this murky area by contrasting the choices made in two existing languages: Dafny and Whiley.  
   
 Best Paper Award  
   
 The Program Committee of GPCE 2022 has decided to give the GPCE 2022 Best Paper Award to:  
 Type System for Four Delimited Control Operators by Chiaki Ishio and Kenichi Asai (Ochanomizu University).  
 Reviewers’ recommendation: “Type System for Four Delimited Control Operators” introduces a language that incorporates four well-known control operators (shift, control, shift0, control0) with a new unified type system derived from a double-CPS interpreter. The reviewers appreciated the technical depth of the work, the thorough comparison to previous systems, and the well-structured exposition. One particularly impressive aspect of the work is the mechanization of the main theorems in Agda, which lends significant credibility to the results. The system is likely to serve as a useful basis for type systems that support additional control features such as answer-type polymorphism and algebraic effects."  
 Congratulations!  
 Yukiyoshi Kameyama, on behalf of the GPCE2022 Program Committee
