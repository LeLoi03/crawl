 Description  
 We are delighted to welcome the 36th Australian Conference on Computer-Human Interaction - OzCHI 2023 back to Aotearoa-New Zealand. The conference will be hosted by Te Herenga Waka, Victoria University of Wellington, and will take place at the School of Design Innovation on the Te Aro Campus. Our theme for the conference this year is ‘Design from a Distant World’, recognising that Australia and New Zealand are physically distant from much of the world, but that we have unusual strengths in Design and Human Computer Interaction. The conference will have both in-person and remotely presented long and short papers, which cover themes such as HCI methods and frameworks; Remote interactions and security; Games and creativity; Aging, health and Accessibility; AR/VR; Co-design and education, and AI. In addition, there will be a demo session, showcasing design and technology work, as well as an industry panel discussing the challenges and benefits of developing software in Aoteroa-NewZealand. Alongside the work from our OzCHI community will are pleased to present our keynote speakers who bring their own unique perspectives to the conference audience. Amber Taylor from ARA journeys will describe her work as a Māori tech entrepreneur in her talk: “Indigenous Knowledge and New Technologies: Bridging Traditions and Innovations from a te ao Māori perspective”; Professor Bill Gaver will talk about the work of the Interaction Research Studio in his talk: “Research Through Design and the Emergence of a Design Programme” and our third speaker, Dr Eunice Sari will draw on her experiences of running projects in remote communities and in educating communities about agile processes in her talk: “Agile Usability Testing: A Transformative Approach for Enhancing Product Quality and Driving Digital Transformation”. We will conclude with a visit to Te Papa Museum of New Zealand, where Jody Wyllie, Curator of Taonga Māori and Research Manager at Tairāwhiti Museum will give a talk about the Rongowhakaata wharenui located within the museum. We are grateful to our sponsors, the Human Factors and Ergonomic Society of Australia Inc (HFESA), Te Herenga Waka, Victoria University of Wellington, the University of Melbourne, SIGCHI NZ and Customer Experience Insight Pty, Ltd. The sponsorship ensures we can support student attendees at the conference and keep costs for all attendees to reasonable levels. We hope you enjoy the conference and the diverse range of presentations. Thanks to the programme committee for all their work in making the conference happen. We can’t wait to meet you all in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington. Judy Bowen and Nadia Pantidi General Chairs, OzCHI 2023

 Search Google Scholar™    
  Citation counts   are sourced monthly from Scopus    and Web of Science®    citation databases.  
 These databases contain citations from different subsets of available publications and different time periods and thus the citation count from each is usually different. Some works are not in either database and no count is displayed. Scopus includes citations from articles published in 1996 onwards, and Web of Science® generally from 1980 onwards.  
 Citations counts from the Google Scholar™    indexing service can be viewed at the linked Google Scholar™ search.
