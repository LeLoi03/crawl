 Welcome to Florida Atlantic University Marketplace  
 The International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics (ISAIM, 2024)  is the eighteenth biennial meeting that fosters interactions between mathematics, theoretical computer science, and artificial intelligence.  
   
  The International Workshop on Combinatorial Image Analysis (IWCIA'24)  is the twenty-second in its series providing theoretical foundations and methods for solving problems appearing in a wide range of application areas based on continuous models requiring numeric computation.
