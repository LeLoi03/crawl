   The International Society for Artificial Life (ISAL) is a democratic, international, professional society dedicated to promoting scientific research and education relating to artificial life, including sponsoring conferences, publishing scientific journals, and maintaining web sites related to artificial life. The biannual International Conference on Artificial Life (ALIFE) and European Conference on Artificial Life (ECAL) are the society's official scientific gatherings.  
 ISAL was established in May 2001 as a non-profit organization. It is governed by a Board of Directors that consists of elected ISAL members as well as individuals specially appointed by the Board. For information on how to join ISAL, please see the Membership section of this website.
