 ===========  
  Introduction  
 With the rapid growth in computing and communications technology, the past decade has witnessed a proliferation of powerful parallel and distributed systems and an ever increasing demand for practice of high performance computing and communications ( HPCC  ). HPCC  has moved into the mainstream of computing and has become a key technology in determining future research and development activities in many academic and industrial branches, especially when the solution of large and complex problems must cope with very tight timing schedules.  
 Among a series of highly successful International Conferences on High Performance Computing and Communications ( HPCC  ), HPCC  conference comes to its 25th edition of a forum for engineers and scientists in academia, industry, and government to address the resulting profound challenges and to present and discuss their new ideas, research results, applications and experience on all aspects of high performance computing and communications. IEEE HPCC  is sponsored by IEEE, IEEE Computer Society, and IEEE  
  Technical Committee on Scalable Computing (TCSC).  
 Scope and Topics  
  Topics of particular interest include, but are not limited to:  
  1. Parallel and distributed system architectures  
  2. Languages and compilers for high performance computing  
  3. Parallel and distributed software technologies  
  4. Parallel and distributed algorithms  
  5. Embedded systems  
  6. Peer-to-peer computing  
  7. Cluster computing  
  8. Web services and Internet computing  
  9. Cloud computing  
  10. Utility computing  
  11. Performance evaluation and measurement  
  12. Tools and environments for software development  
  13. Distributed systems and applications  
  14. High-performance scientific and engineering computing  
  15. Database applications and data mining  
  16. Biological/molecular computing  
  17. Collaborative and cooperative environments  
  18. Mobile computing and wireless communications  
  19. Computer Networks  
  20. Telecommunications  
  21. Pervasive/ubiquitous computing and intelligence  
  22. Autonomic, reliability and fault-tolerance  
  23. Trust, security and privacy  
 Submission Guidelines  
  Submissions must include an abstract, keywords, the e-mail address of the corresponding author and should not exceed 8 pages for main conference, including tables and figures in IEEE CS format. The template files for LATEX or WORD can be downloaded here. All paper. submissions must represent original and unpublished work. Each submission will be peer reviewed by at least three program committee members. Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will register for the conference and present the work. Submit your paper(s) in PDF file at the submission site: http://www.swinflow.org/confs/2023/hpcc/submission.htm  .  
 Publications  
  Accepted and presented papers will be included into the IEEE Conference Proceedings published by IEEE CS Press. Authors of accepted papers, or at least one of them, are requested to register and present their work at the conference, otherwise their papers may be removed from the digital libraries of IEEE CS and EI after the conference. Distinguished papers will be invited to special issues of selected journals listed on the conference website.
