  Call For Papers   
   
 The 18th International Conference on Algorithmic Aspects in Information and Management (AAIM 2024) will be held during September 21-23, 2024 through online conferencing tools. Interesting new results in all areas of algorithm design, operation research and combinatorial optimization and their applications are welcome. Both theoretical and experimental/applied works of general algorithmic interest are sought. Special considerations will be given to algorithmic research that is motivated by real-world applications. Experimental and applied papers are expected to show convincingly the usefulness and efficiency of the target algorithms in practical settings. The topics include, but are not limited to: Algorithms and data structures Algorithmic game theory and incentive analysis Approximation algorithms and online algorithms Automata, languages, logic, and computability Bioinformatics, computational biology and medicine, and biomedical applications Biomedical imaging algorithms Blockchain Combinatorial optimization Combinatorics and discrete structures related to algorithms and complexity Communication networks and optimization Complexity theory Computational algebra, geometry, number theory, and statistics Computational learning theory, knowledge discovery, and data mining Cryptography, reliability, and security Database theory, large databases, and natural language processing Experimental algorithmic methodologies Geometric information processing and communication Graph algorithms and theory Graph drawing and information visualization Internet algorithms and protocols Large graph algorithms and social network analysis Optimization algorithms in economic and operations research Parallel and distributed computing and multicore algorithms Parameterized algorithms, heuristics, and analysis Pattern recognition algorithms Trustworthy algorithms and trustworthy software  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2024-05-26
