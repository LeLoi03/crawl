  In Memoriam | The International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (IFAAMAS) is a non-profit organization whose purpose is to promote science and technology in the areas of artificial intelligence, autonomous agents and multiagent systems.   
   
   IFAAMAS   sponsors the annual International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS).  
   
  The AAMAS conference series was initiated in 2002 as a merger of three highly respected individual conferences: AGENTS (International Conference on Autonomous Agents), ICMAS (International Conference on Multi-Agent Systems), and ATAL (International Workshop on Agent Theories, Architectures, and Languages). The aim of the joint conference is to provide a single, high-profile, internationally renowned forum for research in the theory and practice of autonomous agents and multiagent systems.  

   In pursuit of its purposes, IFAAMAS engages in activities including but not limited to   
   Coordinating and arranging seminars on artificial intelligence, autonomous agents and multiagent systems;  
   
  Serving as a representative forum for experts within the fields of artificial intelligence autonomous agents and multiagent systems;  
   
  Distributing, and making available, knowledge about autonomous agents and multiagent system technology through publications, organizational seminars, courses, and conferences;
