 RESTART at ITC 35th – Networked Systems and Services  
 /   September 25, 2023  /   Events  , News   
 RESTART Foundation President Professor Nicola Blefari Melazzi  will be amongst the keynote speakers  at the International Teletraffic Congress ITC 35th   , to be held on 3-5 October 2023 at Politecnico di Torino.   
 The 35th edition of the international congress in the field of networking science and practice – dis­cussing the latest technical advances in the broad areas of teletraffic models, network systems, and measurements – will see Professor Blefari Melazzi contribute with a speech entitled “   The age of fragmentation (or the end of the Internet as we knew it)” .     
 The talk will discuss some options for the evolution of the network, analysing the role of stakeholders in the changing landscape, identifying open challenges and arguing that without remedial actions there is the possibility of antitrust authorities intervening, potentially causing disruptions in the sector.
