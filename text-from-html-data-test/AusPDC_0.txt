 (Apologies if you received duplicate copies of this CFP) ============================ AusPDC 2022 will be held online in conjunction with Australasian Computer Science Week (ACSW 2022), 14 - 18 February 2022 ( http://acsw.core.edu.au/  )  
 **SCOPE OF THE SYMPOSIUM** In 2010, AusGrid event was broadened to include all aspects of parallel and distributed computing and hence was called as Australasian Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing (AusPDC). Following a couple of successful events, it comes to the 20th in 2022 in the series. In both New Zealand and Australia parallel and distributed computing has been recognised as strategic technologies for driving their moves towards knowledge economies. The symposium is primarily targeted at researchers from Australia and New Zealand, however, in the spirit of parallel and distributed computing, which aims to enable collaboration of distributed virtual organizations, and also the conference being held online this year we encourage papers and participation from international researchers.  
 **TOPICS OF INTEREST** - Cloud computing - Fog/edge computing - Grid and Cluster computing - Big Data processing and analytics - Virtualization, containers, unikernels, orchestration and other enablers - Security, trust and privacy in Clouds/Fog/Edge - Mobile, sensor networks and Internet of things - Data storage, placement and replication - Distributed Ledger Technologies and Blockchains - Multi-core systems - Peer-to-peer computing - GPUs and other forms of special-purpose processors - Service computing and workflow management - Managing large distributed data sets - Middleware and tools - Network function virtualisation and Software-defined networks - Performance evaluation and modelling -Datacentre and Interconnection networks - Performance accelerators - Problem-solving environments - Parallel programming models, languages and compilers - Operating systems and runtime systems - Resource scheduling and load balancing - Data mining and machine learning - Computational Science and Engineering - Agent-based computing - Reliability, security, privacy and dependability - e-Science and e-Health Applications  
 **IMPORTANT DATES** Paper submissions due: 19 November 2021 (29 November 2021 - extended) Author notification: 19 December 2021 Camera-ready full papers due: 14 January 2021 Conference dates: 14 - 18 February 2022  
 All dates refer to 23:59, anywhere on earth (AoE) on that day.  
 **PAPER SUBMISSION** The proceedings of the symposium will be published by ACM in conjunction with ACSW 2022. Papers should be formatted in double-column according to ACM conference paper formatting guidelines ACM SIG Proceedings Templates. The following guidelines must be met for all submissions: - Submissions must be in English. - Submissions must not exceed 10 pages for full papers, 4 pages for short papers and 2 pages for posters. - Submissions must be in PDF format. Other formats will not be accepted. - Submissions must clearly state the problem being addressed, the goal of the work, the results achieved, and the relation to other work. - Submissions must be original contributions that have not been published previously, nor already submitted to other conferences or journals in parallel with this conference. - Authors must choose the appropriate satellite conference or workshop for your submission  
 Papers are to be submitted via the ACSW 2022 Easy Chair Submission Site ( https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=acsw2022  ).  
 Upon logging into the system, please select “New Submission”, then select "Australasian Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing" track and proceed through the steps for submission. Every submission will be reviewed by a minimum of three members of the program committee.  
 **PAPER AWARDS** A selection commission chaired by the AusPDC technical programme committee will select and acknowledge the best paper and the best student paper to receive an award during the conference. Committee  
 **GENERAL CO-CHAIRS** Rajkumar Buyya, University of Melbourne, Australia Bahman Javadi, Western Sydney University, Australia  
 **PROGRAM COMMITTEE CHAIRS** Adel N. Toosi, Monash University, Australia Sara Khalifa, CSIRO’s Data61, Australia  
 **STEERING COMMITTEE** Schahram Dustdar, Technical University of Vienna, Austria Zahir Tari, RMIT University, Australia Salil Kanhere, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia Yun Yang, Swinburne University of Technology, Australia Javid Taheri, Karlstad University, Sweden
