  Speech Abstract:  Video in the form of image sequences, which lose the temporal process of the photons flow, leads to an irreconcilable dilemma between high-dynamic and high-speed imaging. Based on the fact that the pixels of the photoelectric sensor are indepen⁃ dent, a new continuous photographing principle is invented: for each pixel, accumulate charge from the reset state, generate a spike as a flag once the specified threshold is reached, reset and repeat. The duration that a spike takes to be fired is called its spiking width, which is inversely proportional to the light intensity during this period. Based on this, the light intensity during this period can be estimated. The array of the spike sequences of all pixels is so-called “viform”, which contains rich spatial and temporal information of the light process. A n image at any moment can be calculated from viform, thereby ultrahigh-speed, high-dynamic and non-blurred continuous im⁃ aging achieved.Employing mature CMOS photonic devices and standard processes, two spike continuous photographing chips and spike cameras with spatial resolutions of 0.1 million and 1 million pixels have been developed, respectively. Viform will fundamentally reshapes computer vision and visual information processing technology and industries. An open source algorithm framework, SpikeCV, achieves high-speed target detection, tracking, and recognition system that is faster than the human eye by thousands of times, with low computational complexity.

  Speech Abstract:  Machine Unlearning.  
  Big data has been one of the important enablers of the recent advances in Artificial Intelligence. Its use for training machine learning models has enabled many useful applications. However, there are also some downsides when the data contains sensitive, often personal, information. Recent privacy and data protection regulations across the world have recognized the “right to be forgotten” as a fundamental right of citizens. Enabling this in practice not only requires deletion of data from institutional databases but also necessitates deletion of data from trained machine learning models. Machine Unlearning refers to the process of selectively removing or forgetting some specific data or a class of data from a machine learning (often deep learning) model. This talk will introduce the emerging field of machine unlearning, discuss the motivations behind it, the techniques employed, and its implications for data privacy, fairness, and interpretability. We will present several approaches for unlearning, including the selective modification of model parameters, regularization techniques, data-free methods, and teacher-student frameworks. We will then discuss the challenges and open research questions in the field. Machine Unlearning can thus be seen to contribute towards building more accountable AI systems that can engender trust among users and stakeholders.

  Speech Abstract:  Tracing the Evolution of Face Recognition Technology.  
  Face recognition is one of computer vision's most active and successful areas, with various applications, including security, surveillance, and social media. In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of face recognition algorithms, which can now achieve high accuracy even on challenging datasets. However, several challenges still need to be addressed before face recognition can be widely deployed in real-world applications. This keynote will discuss the state of the art in face recognition, focusing on facial analysis and the challenges that remain. In the first part of the talk, we will review recent advances in face detection, facial attribute recognition, and other facial analysis tasks. We will also discuss the impact of these advances on applications such as security and surveillance. In the second part of the talk, we will discuss the challenges that remain in face recognition. These challenges include face recognition in low-quality images, explainability, fairness, social relationships, and ethics. We will discuss the current state of research on these challenges and propose potential directions for future work. .

  Speech Abstract:  See the unseen – we cannot automate what we cannot see in agriculture and aquaculture.  
  The recent explosion of AI/ML/Vision algorithm accuracy, efficiency and low processing cost has suddenly enabled applications undreamt of even five years ago – especially for challenging outdoor agritech applications. Our research is interested in these real-world applications, such as rapid data reduction of petabytes of data from scanning a farm (such as orchards or vineyards) from sub-mm under-canopy/underwater proximal sensing. We cannot automate what we cannot see – so our recent breakthroughs with NeRF and Gaussian splatting is helping to solve leaf occlusion to enable a rapid uptake of agricultural automation. I will describe our contributions across these research areas, including recent autonomous systems research into drones pruning forests, robots pruning vineyards, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) inspecting mussel lines to detect invasive biofouling species and AUVs mapping the seabed to locate scallops. We will also discuss the challenges that remain and so propose potential directions for future work.
