    [DMANET] PSC 2023 - Call for papers  

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Prague Stringology Conference 2023  
 26th Prague Stringology Conference  
 http://www.stringology.org   
 Call for Papers  
 Prague, Czech Republic, August 28-30, 2023  
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 PSC 2023 is the 26th Prague Stringology Conference. It is an international  
  conference focusing on stringology and related areas. It is organized  
  annually since 1996 by the Prague Stringology Club, a research group  
  in the Department of Theoretical Computer Science at the Faculty of  
  Information Technology of Czech Technical University in Prague. The  
  proceedings of recent conferences are indexed in Thomson Reuters,  
  Scopus and DBLP.  
  
 TOPICS:  
 Stringology is a part of algorithmic research that deals with the  
  processing of text strings. It has existed for at least thirty years  
  and developed into a respected subfield of its own. The last twenty  
  years have produced an explosion of new results. This progress is due  
  in part to the human genome effort, an area to which string algorithms  
  make important contributions. String processing extends into tree  
  processing that is called Arbology. The topics of the conference  
  include but are not limited to:  
 * algorithms for pattern matching in strings, images and trees  
  * data structures (automata, trees etc.) for pattern matching  
  in strings, images and trees  
  * coding and data compression  
  * bioinformatics  
  * information retrieval  
  * string processing algorithms in databases  
  * searching for regularities  
  * natural language processing  
  
  SUBMISSION:  
 Authors are cordially invited to submit their full papers (PDF format,  
  up to 15 pages, A4 page format) by May 16, 2023. The paper should start  
  with the title, each author's name, affiliation, and e-mail address,  
  and a one-paragraph summary of the results and ideas. The paper should  
  be submitted via submission server  
  ( https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=psc2023  ).  
  The paper title, authors, and abstract should be submitted by May 16,  
  2023. The full paper in PDF should be submitted by May 23, 2023.  
 For their final version the papers are required to be prepared using  
  the LaTeX style available at http://www.stringology.org/pscproc2   
  which has an interface compatible to the standard LNCS style.

 HISTORY:  
 PSC 2023 was preceded by Prague Stringology Workshops in 1996-2000 and  
  by Prague Stringology Conferences in 2001-2006, 2008-2021. Each year  
  proceedings are prepared for the conference. They are published by  
  Czech Technical University in Prague and are also available from the  
  PSC web pages. Selected papers from the later workshops were also  
  published in a special issue of the journal Kybernetika. Selected  
  papers from the 2002-2006, 2008 conferences were then published in the  
  Nordic Journal of Computing, Journal of Automata, Languages, and  
  Combinatorics, International Journal of Foundations in Computer  
  Science, and Discrete Applied Mathematics.  
  
 LOCATION & PUBLICATION:  
 PSC 2023 will be held at the Department of Theoretical Computer Science  
  the Czech Technical University in Prague on August 28-30, 2023.  
  (The precise location will be announced later.) The working  
  language is English. As usual, accepted papers will appear in  
  conference proceedings published by the Czech Technical University in  
  Prague and distributed at the conference. After further refereeing,  
  selected papers will then be published in an international journal.
