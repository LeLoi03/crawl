 Description   
 The Covid-19 Pandemic and climate change repropose the issues of the relation between the built environment (BE) and quality of life, subjective well-being (SWB), Liveability and Health. In response to these new urban concerns, urban policies have focused on reorganising cities to improve strategies for achieving resilience, sustainability, inclusion and individuals’ quality of life. The C40 cities initiative, that include 100 major cities in several Countries, underlines the need for actions of urban regeneration as a central condition for a sustainable and just recovery. Strategies adopted in several cities, including Milan, Paris, Bogotà, Portland, Melbourne focus on a re-configuration of the built environment aimed at implementing smart and sustainable mobility solutions, expanding the ecological infrastructure, increasing the provision of basic services at the district scale, and transforming public and open spaces for multi-functional uses (C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, 2020; Miller, 2021). The emerging urban concepts proposed for the post-pandemic scenario converge on the idea of an adaptive transformation of the urban environment based on criteria of density, diversity, safety, proximity and digitalisation. These aspects can be summarised in the idea of the smart and healthy city. The latter can be defined as an urban concept that prefigures the integration of the dimensions of proximity and diversity of primary and secondary uses, localization and distribution of local services, density, digitalisation and usability of public and open spaces, as central aspects for constructing a city, for the post-pandemic scenario, that ensures quality of life, well-being, sustainability, and social inclusion.  
 Thus, the proposed workshop aims to investigate (but is not limited) the issue of the relation between built environment components and SWB, as a key aspect for the construction of smarter, safer, and healthier cities for the post-pandemic scenario.  
 The workshop will host contributions focusing on the theoretical and methodological approaches related to the construction of a smart, safe and healthy city for the post-pandemic scenario. More precisely, the pertinent topics will include: i) the conceptualisation of the post-pandemic city within the perspective of the smarter, safer, and healthier city; ii) the influence of physical components of the urban built environment on quality of life; iii) the role of public and open spaces to promote a liveable and sustainable urban environment; iv) the influence of urban characteristics on the perception of the built environment from the different categories of citizens; v) the analytic methods, tools and techniques to support urban decision process oriented to smart, safe and healthy cities; vi) strategies of urban planning within a perspective of sustainability, inclusion and cohesion.  
 Given the focus of the Conference on Computational Science issues, the workshop welcomes contributions on ICT and computational aspects, proposals, and applications from a wide variety of scholars on the above-mentioned issues.  
 Engineers, Geologists, Urban and Regional Planners, Landscape Architects, Geographers and Economic Geographers, Environmental Engineers, among others are welcome to contribute.

 Description   
 Government agencies responsible for climate change and waste management worldwide are challenged by minimising urban pollution. The task of minimising pollution requires an understanding of their sources, distribution patterns and accumulation zones, at global level. In fact, a South-North “virtual corridor” is envisaged for a knowledge exchange on how various regions of the globe understand the relationship between Climate Change and smart and sustainable cities.  
 The objective of this workshop focuses on tools, practices and approaches related to climate change adaptation towards smarter and more sustainable cities, and, in particular, on how the advanced use of remote sensing, satellite imagery, participatory mapping, citizens science and future ecosystems modelling can assist in building a more a smart and sustainable city.  
 Focusing on the link between climate change and cities transition on climate change adaptation, the workshop by critically focus on (but not limited to) the following issues:  
 Exploring the nexus between waste, climate change and future ecosystems by considering the similarities and differences between the South and the North of the world. 
  Presenting the concept of sustainability, resilience, and climate change adaptation in the South and North of the world in urban and region world contexts. 
  Investigating how the advanced use of remote sensing may help in the transition of resilient cities into intelligent, wise, and sustainable communities. 
  Climate Change mapping and modelling, as well as preserving river and ocean pollution. 
  Building urban resilience and urban smartness in cities through participatory mapping, citizen science and/or other tools, practices, and approaches.

 Description   
 The purpose of the “USAM” workshop is to enhance discussions on the criteria and applications, methodologies and tools useful for identifying, evaluating, planning and designing inclusive, diverse and accessibility for all. Universal accessibility or ‘access for all’ is a key component of achieving sustainable development. Conventional transport and land use planning seek an improvement of accessibility without directly serving the real needs of individuals and groups. This leads to issues of transport disadvantage and mobility inequality that translates to lack of access or ability to access key functions and hampering development of social opportunities. These inequalities can manifest in fundamental forms such as lack of access to employment, education or services. Inequalities can also be more insidious such as perceived lack of safety by certain user groups due to their socio-demographic characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity and income levels) that prevent them from accessing parts of their cities and regions.  
 As transport networks have become increasingly complex and dynamic, intermodality and users specific schemes and policies are needed. The concept of universal accessibility is important for the realisation of urban space that is legitimate, vital and serves a wider demographic. This supports the realisation of Sustainable Development Goals 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and 5 (Gender equality). The workshop welcomes all interpretations of universal accessibility from exploration of the physical infrastructure, psychological and cognitive accessibility and perceive and real safety of diverse user groups. The latest generation ITS technologies, such as innovative flexible services and real-time users’ information, Internet of Things, augmented reality, virtual reality and smart roads offers new paths of explorations. The widespread availability of user information and data is also another aspect to for further explorations.  
 Focusing on inclusive, diverse and universal accessibility, this workshop invites critical exploration (but not limited to) the following issues:  
 Studying and recognizing the specificities and differences between the various user groups, identifying needs, opportunities and abilities and, challenging the ‘one size fits all’ approach of current transport policies; 
  Analysis of spatial conditions necessary for design and creation of spaces, strategies and measures to promote universal accessibility; 
  Tools and methods for integrated approaches for decision making to ensure spatial quality of public spaces, level of safety and security, contrasting urban degradation and how foster a comprehensive regeneration of urban spaces according to universal accessibility criteria; 
  Supporting public system strategies in order to guarantee an optimal use of resources for the creation of overall present and future value in local communities; 
  Promoting social inclusion and raising people’s well-being and autonomy also through the development of knowledge, methodologies, technological tools and advanced automation techniques. 
  Given the focus of the Conference on Computational Science issues, the workshop USAM welcomes contributions on ICT and computational aspects, proposals and applications from a wide variety of scholars on the issues proposed.  
 Engineers, Geologists, Urban and Regional Planners, Landscape Architects, Geographers and Economic Geographers, Environmental Engineers, among others are welcome to contribute.

 Description   
   
 Development and territorial cohesion of island regions embrace tricky planning and policy issues that are closely related to the inherent structural problems such fragmented places exhibit. Dealing with these issues implies the need to feature, comprehend and properly manage island territories in a holistic and integrated way, taking into consideration both their spectacular and valuable natural and cultural assets, as well as the physical barriers and their impacts on the future development pathways of insular communities.  
  In handling islands’ inefficiencies but also prospects, this workshop aims to get insight into the strengths but also the structural weaknesses of various types of island regions; and explore the potential of technological developments and their applications for effectively handling such inefficiencies in these, largely neglected, European territories.  
  Focusing on the main strengths and weaknesses of insular territories as well as the current technological developments and their potential for coping with islands’ development lag, the concept of “Smart Islands” is explored by critically focusing on (but not limited to) the following issues:  
 [1] Exploration of current national and international initiatives, knowledge and practice on the topic of smart islands’ development.  
  [2] Identification of strengths and structural weaknesses of various types of island regions.  
  [3] Exploration of the use of technological advances for establishing strong links among productive sectors in insular communities and creating value chains as a driving force for adding value to the economy and society of island territories.  
  [4] Potential smart applications for serving environmental, societal and sectoral needs and goals of island regions, with special emphasis on smart governance and spatial data management for place-based decision-making and monitoring of spatial dynamics in island contexts.  
  [5] Integrated participatory planning in island regions as essential tool for setting up effective strategies and related policy paths for sustainable and resilient resource management and more promising future development trails of island communities.  
  [6] Delineation of practical or theoretical guidelines or strategies for establishing smartness in “fragile” insular spatial contexts, also in terms of mobility and distributive logistics.  
  [7] Consideration of technology at the service of islands’ sustainability, resilience, cultural development, citizens’ empowerment and engagement, strengthening of identity and social ties, etc.

 Description   
   
 Invention of smart cities is rapidly influencing the processes of urban development. This shift and the consequent impact in many areas (population growth, mobility, energy, healthcare, technology, culture, etc.) have motivated public administrators and stakeholders to foresee, plan, and integrate the existing facilities of cities and communities in order to improve individual and collective well-being.  
  These new ongoing processes aim to facilitate good urban strategies, policies, and short- and long-term actions, by triggering greater economic, social, and environmental sustainability.  
 Focusing on urban government and smart city inventiveness, this workshop may critically explore (but is not limited) these relevant issues.  
 How to expand the knowledge of the political machinery that is behind the conceptualisation, implementation, and development of so-called smart cities. 
  How can we govern current and future urban trends, enhancing the dynamic synergies between the material and immaterial data of a city (big data, IoT/IoE, sensor networks, blockchain, etc.) 
  What are the specifics in the development of smart cities in European countries and beyond. 
  How can we develop smart and open governance as a new stage of local governance. 
  How can we govern the urban and regional relationships without compromising urban-land synergies (between the city and the territory). 
  How to investigate appropriate governance models and tools in order to trigger virtuous behaviours, suitable in dynamic cities, and how to balance the new tools based on IT and the classical governance tools. 
  How to reflect the behavioural economics in development of smart cities and co-creation and co-production of public services. 
  How and if ‘smart city policies’ have an impact on the city and regional economies and make cities competitive at the national and international levels. 
  How to integrate the various approaches to local development with aim to strength the resilience of the cities. 
  Reflect on the relations between advance technology (ICT in particular) and human – place relations in the current urban environment 
  How can we govern the urban and regional relationships between advanced technology and smart city metamorphosis (competitiveness, cohesion, conservation, resilience…) 
  Reflect on the relations between advance technology and the hyper strategic planning in the smart city 
  Given the focus of the Conference on Computational Science issues, the workshop welcomes contributions on ICT and computational aspects, proposals and applications from a wide variety of scholars on the above mentined issues.  
  Engineers, Geologists, Urban and Regional Planners, Landscape Architects, Geographers and Economic Geographers, Environmental Engineers, among others are welcome to contribute.

   Il 10 giugno 2022  si terrà il Convegno Nazionale e Sperimentazione pilota WEAKI TRANSIT. Il futuro dell’integrazione modale nelle aree a domanda debole   , organizzato da Mauro Coni, Chiara Garau e Francesca Maltinti docenti del DICAAR.  
 Il convegno si terrà al Museo dell’Istituto Minerario G. Asproni di Iglesias, dove verrà presentato il Progetto di Rilevanza Nazionale (PRIN 2017) “WEAKI TRANSIT: WEAK-demand areas Innovative TRANsport Shared services for Italian Towns  ”, che il gruppo di ricerca cagliaritano porta avanti assieme alle Università di Catania, Palermo, Enna Kore.  
 La giornata è dedicata alla diffusione dei risultati conseguiti e alla sperimentazione  della mobilità condivisa e dell’integrazione modale.  
 Con un unico biglietto Trenitalia i partecipanti partiranno in treno da Cagliari verso Iglesias e da qui arriveranno a Porto Flavia con minibus e auto elettrica  . L’integrazione tra più vettori consentirà di raggiungere senza l’auto privata una località non servita puntualmente dai mezzi del trasporto pubblico; un risultato possibile grazie alla collaborazione tra amministrazione comunale di Iglesias, Trenitalia e i partner PlayCar e BeTools.  
 L’ambito di ricerca del progetto WEAKI Transit riguarda i sistemi innovativi di mobilità condivisa  nelle aree cosiddette a domanda debole  con l’obiettivo di studiare la fattibilità, la pianificazione e la progettazione di servizi di DRST (Demand Responsive Shared Transport) che possano fornire mobilità on demand in tempo reale, attraverso flotte di veicoli in condivisione.
