 ICGT 2023 - CALL FOR PARTICIPATION  
 16th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2023)  
 19-20 July in Leicester, UK, as part of STAF 2023  
 web: https://conf.researchr.org/home/staf-2023   
  
 ABOUT   
 The International Conference on Graph Transformation aims at fostering exchange and collaboration of researchers from different backgrounds working with graphs and graph transformation, either in contributing to their theoretical foundations or by applying established formalisms to classical or novel areas. The conference not only serves as a well-established scientific publication outlet, but also as a platform to boost inter- and intra-disciplinary research and to leeway for new ideas. The 16th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2023) will be held in Leicester, UK, as part of STAF 2023 (Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations). The conference takes place under the auspices of EASST, EATCS and IFIP WG 1.3. Proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.  
 REGISTRATION   
 Registration details are available on the STAF'23 webpage: https://conf.researchr.org/attending/staf-2023/registration   
 Early bird registration ends on 14th June  . Accommodation (limited supply) is available at the conference venue for the heavily discounted price of £40/night.

 PROGRAMME   
 The ICGT'23 programme features 19 talks in addition to the keynotes: https://conf.researchr.org/program/icgt-2023/program-icgt-2023/   
 The papers cover a wide spectrum, including theoretical approaches to graph transformation, logic and verification for graph transformation, and model transformation, as well as the application of graph transformation in new areas such as bond graphs and graph neural networks. ICGT'23 is co-located with ECMFA, TAP, and several relevant workshops: https://conf.researchr.org/info/staf-2023/schedule
