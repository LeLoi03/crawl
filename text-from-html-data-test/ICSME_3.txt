 International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME)  

 REGISTER TODAY      

 Since its start in 1983, the International Conference on Software Maintenance (ICSM)  has grown and developed into an international forum for software maintenance researchers and practitioners to examine key issues facing the software maintenance community. Participants from academia, government, and industry share ideas and experiences solving critical software maintenance problems.  
 Reflecting the importance of evolutionary challenges in software maintenance, starting from 2014 ICSM became known as as the International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME)  .  
 The ICSME conference is the premier international (world wide) event in the maintenance field. The importance of software maintenance is being increasingly recognised, both in terms of professional activities and of public perception (the Y2K Millennium bug and the Euro-conversion being the most obvious examples). Hence it is vital for the community of researchers and practitioners to publish, present, and debate the latest results in the field. The ICSME proceedings present works of outstanding international excellence, where reports on the latest advances in the field may be found.  
 Previous ICSME conferences demonstrated tremendous interest and enthusiasm on the part of both researchers and applications personnel for current work in software maintenance. Many excellent papers were submitted and debated, showing that there is increasing interest in the subject.  
 ICSME is truly an international meeting place for researchers and practitioners in the field. Members of the program committee represent many different countries of the world. Many of the authors of papers also represent the software engineering interests of the international community. A main goal of ICSM is to promote interaction between researchers and practitioners. ICSME will bring together researchers, practitioners, developers and users of tools, technology transfer experts, and project managers.  
 Beware of other conferences that call themselves International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME), which are not IEEE sponsored or affiliated with ICSME.   

 Next Conference  
 ICSME 2022  will be held in Cyprus, September 26 – 30, 2022   

 Future Conferences  
 ICSME 2023 | will be decided and announced soon. 
  We welcome proposals to host | ICSME 2024 | . | Please contact the chair of the Steering Committee.
