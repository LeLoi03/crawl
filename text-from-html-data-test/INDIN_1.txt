 Statements about INDIN 2023  

 Kathrin Leiner  
 F&E Technologiesysteme WM, TRUMPF Werkzeugmaschinen SE + Co. KG, Germany  
 The conference was a fantastic event with a large number of highly interesting technical presentations. The topics showcased the current research areas in the industry and the challenges associated with them. The opportunity to network with like-minded people enabled interesting discussions and inspired and motivated me for my further research. Special thanks must go to the excellent organisation of the conference, which ensured that everything ran perfectly well. Overall, the event was an enriching experience that has further strengthened my interest.  

 Marcel Dix  
 Scientist Industrial AI, ABB AG Corporate Research Center Germany  
 A significant number of contributions at this year's INDIN conference concerned the fascinating topic of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This clearly reflects the growing importance of AI at my company ABB as well, as the increasing digital transformation in our industries opens up diverse applications for AI.  
 Here, a challenge will be to make the predictions of AI models more explainable for industrial users, so that AI can genuinely provide valuable support to them. To address this issue, we were truly grateful for the opportunity to host a special session at the INDIN 2023 on the issue of Explainable AI (XAI) and interactive Machine Learning for industrial applications.  
 Our heartfelt appreciation goes to the conference chairs, organizers, and the many dedicated helpers who made this conference an outstanding success, featuring a highly engaging program, all made possible at the cutting-edge university campus of TH OWL in Lemgo.

 The 2023 IEEE INDIN conference in Lemgo exceeded all expectations with its exceptional organization and seamless execution. The event boasted an impressive lineup of distinguished speakers, delivering profound insights, alongside numerous high-quality scientific articles. The gala dinner was a standout, leaving a lasting impression on the attendees. Special recognition goes to the co-chairs, Prof. Lukasz Wisniewski and Prof. Juergen Jasperneite, and the entire local team in Lemgo for their outstanding efforts. Undoubtedly, this year’s conference ranks among the finest I’ve ever attended, and it was a privilege to be part of such remarkable gathering.

 INDIN 2023 at Lemgo is such a wonderful conference, and I am so happy to participate. Discussion of innovation driven industrial informatics, sustainable development of ecosystem such as OWL, and from Lemgo to the whole world: a global network of local innovative communities, is so impressive and forward-looking. Of course, the deep hospitality and well-organized activities are also very impressive!  

 Lukasz Wisniewski  
 Professor, TH OWL | Executive Board Member of inIT, Germany  
 We are very proud to host such a prestigious conference as INDIN at the innovation campus in Lemgo with over 250 participants from around the world. Once again, we observed how important personal interaction is when it comes to discussing and creating future technologies. We are delighted that we could also share the vision of technology transfer in the Ostwestfalen Lippe (OWL) Region with the participants, which is crucial for sustainable research and innovation hubs. After receiving so many kind words and much positive feedback from the participants, we can confidently say that it was a highly successful event. We'd like to express our gratitude to all the authors for their contributions to the technical program, as well as to all the people involved in the organization. This event highlighted how essential it is to meet in person, interact, and enjoy each other's company. We would also like to extend an invitation to all participants of this year's edition to join for the next edition of INDIN, which will take place in Beijing.  

 Jürgen Jasperneite  
 Professor, TH OWL | Director Fraunhofer IOSB-INA, Germany  
 From our point of view, INDIN 2023 was a complete success. We were able to further consolidate our claim to be a significant hub in the international knowledge network of industrial automation technologies. More than 250 participants from all over the world were guests in the Old Hanseatic Town of Lemgo. In more than 160 paper contributions, the current state of the art in industrial informatics was discussed. Our guests also enjoyed the social events. And thanks to our great organization team, we have shown that we are able to host larger international conferences at the Innovation Campus Lemgo.
