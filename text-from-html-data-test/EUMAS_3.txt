 EUMAS 2023  

 20th European Conference on Multi-Agent Systems   
 Napoli, Italy, 14/09/2023–15/09/2023   
 The 20th European Conference on Multi-Agent Systems (EUMAS 2023) will be located at the University of Naples (September 14-15th, 2023). EUMAS 2023 is an EURAMAS designated event which follows the tradition of previous editions (Oxford 2003, Barcelona 2004, Brussels 2005, Lisbon 2006, Hammamet 2007, Bath 2008, Agia Napa 2009, Paris 2010, Maastricht 2011, Dublin 2012, Toulouse 2013, Prague 2014, Athens 2015, Valencia 2016, Evry 2017, Bergen 2018, Thessaloniki 2020, Israel (online) 2021, Düsseldorf 2022), and aims to encourage and support activity in the research and development of multi-agent systems, in academic and industrial effort. The conference aspires to be the primary European forum for researchers interested in the theory and practice of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. EUMAS enables researchers to meet, present challenges, preliminary and mature research results in an open environment. EUMAS 2023 features formal proceedings published as part of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series of Springer
