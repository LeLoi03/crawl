 Welcome to the 14th International Conference on Computational Creativity (ICCC' 2023)!   
   
 Computational creativity is the art, science, philosophy, and engineering of computational systems which, by taking on particular responsibilities, exhibit behaviors that unbiased observers would deem to be creative. As a field of research, this area is thriving, with progress in formalizing what it means for software to be creative, along with many exciting and valuable applications of creative software in the sciences, the arts, literature, gaming, and elsewhere.   
   
 The ICCC conference series organized by the Association for Computational Creativity since 2010 is the only scientific conference that focuses on computational creativity alone and also covers all aspects of it.   
   
 ICCC' 23 will take place Monday, June 19 to Friday, June 23, 2023 at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada.
