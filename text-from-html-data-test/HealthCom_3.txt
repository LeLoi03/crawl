 About Me  
 Prof Pradeep Ray is the Founder of the Centre For Entrepreneurship (CFE) at the University of Michigan Joint Institute in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China. He leads the multi-disciplinary (Engineering, healthcare, business and entrepreneurship and social sciences), multi country (more than ten across Asia, Australia and Europe) initiative (since 2018) called Technology Entrepreneurship for Sustainable Development (TESD) that led to four books since 2020 as listed in the publications. He taught in the UNSW Business School since 1999. He has been the founder Director (2013-2016) of the WHO Collaborating Centre on eHealth at the University of New South Wales (UNSW)-Australia where he is an Honorary Professor since 2016. In recognition to his global contribution in mHealth and eHealth, he was elected a Fellow of the Australasian College of Health Informatics.  
 Pradeep led to completion (2006-2009) the WHO Research on the Assessment of e-Health for Health Care Delivery (eHCD) involving a number of countries in the Asia-Pacific region (India, China, Vietnam and Philippines). Pradeep also led to completion a number of international initiatives, such as the ITU-D/IEEE Mobile eHealth Initiative for Developing Countries (2004-2009) and the Global Longitudinal Study on the Assessment of mHealth (2009-2012). This study involved a number of developing countries, such as Bangladesh, India, PNG and Indonesia. The highly cited work by APuHC on mHealth Bangladesh led to the formation of the UNSW Yunus Social Business Hub for Health, the first of its kind in Australia.  
  He is currently a Fellow of IET, UK (since 2023). Prior to that, he has been an active Senior Member of IEEE as IEEE Distinguished Lecturer on eHealth (2014-2022). He has been a founder and a Chair of IEEE eHealth Technical Committee (2009-2013) and the founder of IEEE Healthcom (1999-2019). He has been leading a number of collaborative research projects with reputed International Research Organisations all over the world, sponsored by the European Union, WHO, ITU and IEEE. He has been involved in organising a number of international conferences, sponsored by IEEE, ITU and WHO.  
  He has a Ph.D in Information Technology from the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS), Australia , Masters in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, and a Bachelor of Electronics Engineering from BHU-IT, Banaras, India. He has more than ten years' experience in technical and management positions in International Information Technology Business Organisations. Pradeep Ray has published more than two hundred and fifty articles in international refereed journals and conferences.
