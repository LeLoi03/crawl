  Call For Papers   
   
 The aim of ALENEX is to provide a forum for the presentation of original research in the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of algorithms and data structures. Typical submissions will include an extensive experimental analysis of nontrivial algorithmic results, ideally bridging the gap between theory and practice. We also invite submissions that address methodological issues and standards in the experimental evaluation of algorithms and data structures. Relevant areas of applied algorithmic research include but are not limited to databases; geometry; graphs and networks, including web applications; operations research; combinatorial aspects of scientific computing; and computational problems in the natural sciences or engineering. Also encouraged are submissions that address algorithms and data structures for advanced models of computing, including memory hierarchies and parallel computing, ranging from instruction parallelism over multicore computing to high-performance and cloud computing. Proceedings will be posted online in January 2025. ALENEX is supported by SIAM. Since researchers in all fields are approaching the problem of learning detailed information about the performance of particular algorithms, we expect that interesting synergies will develop between the co-located conferences. The following meetings will be held jointly: ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA) SIAM Symposium on Algorithm Engineering and Experiments (ALENEX) SIAM Symposium on Simplicity in Algorithms (SOSA)  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2024-06-13
