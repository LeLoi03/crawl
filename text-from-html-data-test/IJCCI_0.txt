 IJCCI 2023 will be held in conjunction with ICINCO 2023    , WEBIST 2023    , IN4PL 2023    and IC3K 2023    .   
  Registration to IJCCI allows free access to the ICINCO, WEBIST, IN4PL and IC3K conferences (as a non-speaker).  

 The purpose of IJCCI is to bring together researchers, engineers and practitioners on the areas of Fuzzy Computation, Evolutionary Computation and Neural Computation. IJCCI is composed of three co-located conferences, each specialized in at least one of the aforementioned main knowledge areas.  

  Although the conference is back to the normal mode (i.e., in-person) speakers are allowed to present remotely if unable to travel to the venue (hybrid support).
