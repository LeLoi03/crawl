 Date: Thu, 20 Apr 2023 12:37:41 +0200 To: Marcin Paprzycki <marcin.paprzycki@mans.org.pl> From: Marcin Paprzycki <marcin@amu.edu.pl> Subject: [EMSIG Mailing List] CFP; Joint 43rd IEEE Software Engineering Workshop,and,10th International Workshop on Cyber-Physical Systems (SEW-43 & IWCPS-10); Web of Science Reply-To: <announcements@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr>, [...] CALL FOR PAPERS Joint 43rd IEEE Software Engineering Workshop and 10th International Workshop on Cyber-Physical Systems (SEW-43 & IWCPS-10) Warsaw, Poland, 17-20 September, 2023 https://fedcsis.org/sessions/s3e/sew-iwcps  Organized within FedCSIS 2023 (IEEE: #57573) Strict submission deadline: May 23, 2023, 23:59:59 AOE (no extensions) KEY FACTS: Proceedings: submitted to IEEE Digital Library; indexing: DBLP, Scopus and Web of Science; 70 punktów parametrycznych MEiN Please feel free to forward this announcement to your colleagues and associates who could be interested in it. ********************* Statement concerning LLMs ********************* Recognizing developing issue that affects all academic disciplines, we would like to state that, in principle, papers that include text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM) are prohibited, unless the produced text is used within the experimental part of the work. ********************************************************************* The IEEE Software Engineering Workshop (SEW) is the oldest Software Engineering event in the world, dating back to 1969. The workshop was originally run as the NASA Software Engineering Workshop and focused on software engineering issues relevant to NASA and the space industry. After the 25th edition, it became the NASA/IEEE Software Engineering Workshop and expanded its remit to address many more areas of software engineering with emphasis on practical issues, industrial experience and case studies in addition to traditional technical papers. Since its 31st edition, it has been sponsored by IEEE and has continued to broaden its areas of interest. One such extremely hot new area are Cyber-physical Systems (CPS), which encompass the investigation of approaches related to the development and use of modern software systems interfacing with real world and controlling their surroundings. CPS are physical and engineering systems closely integrated with their typically networked environment. Modern airplanes, automobiles, or medical devices are practically networks of computers. Sensors, robots, and intelligent devices are abundant. Human life depends on them. CPS systems transform how people interact with the physical world just like the Internet transformed how people interact with one another. The joint workshop aims to bring together all those researchers with an interest in software engineering, both with CPS and broader focus. Traditionally, these workshops attract industrial and government practitioners and academics pursuing the advancement of software engineering principles, techniques and practices. This joint edition will also provide a forum for reporting on past experiences, for describing new and emerging results and approaches, and for exchanging ideas on best practice and future directions.

Traditionally, the workshop attracts industrial and government practitioners and academics pursuing the advancement of software engineering principles, techniques and practice. The workshop provides a forum for reporting on past experiences, for describing new and emerging results and approaches, and for exchanging ideas on best practice and future directions. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: + Experiments and experience reports + Software quality assurance and metrics + Formal methods and formal approaches to software development + Software engineering processes and process improvement + Agile and lean methods + Requirements engineering + Software architectures + Design methodologies + Validation and verification + Software maintenance, reuse, and legacy systems + Agent-based software systems + Self-managing systems + New approaches to software engineering (e.g., search based software engineering) + Software engineering issues in cyber-physical systems + Real-time software engineering + Safety assurance & certification + Software security + Embedded control systems and networks + Software aspects of the Internet of Things + Software engineering education, laboratories and pedagogy + Software engineering for social media Submission rules: - Authors should submit their papers as Postscript, PDF or MSWord files. - The total length of a paper should not exceed 10 pages IEEE style (including tables, figures and references). IEEE style templates are available here. - Papers will be refereed and accepted on the basis of their scientific merit and relevance to the workshop. - Preprints containing accepted papers will be published on a USB memory stick provided to the FedCSIS participants. - Only papers presented at the conference will be published in Conference Proceedings and submitted for inclusion in the IEEE XploreŽ database. - Conference proceedings will be published in a volume with ISBN ISSN and DOI numbers and posted at the conference WWW site. - Conference proceedings will be submitted for indexation according to information here. - Organizers reserve right to move accepted papers between FedCSIS technical sessions. Important dates: + Paper submission (strict deadline): May 23, 2023, 23:59:59 (AoE; there will be no extension) + Position paper submission: June 7, 2023 + Author notification: July 11, 2023 + Final paper submission and registration: July 31, 2023 + Payment (early fee deadline): July 26, 2023 + Conference date: September 17-20, 2023 SEW-43 & IWCPS-10 Committee: https://fedcsis.org/sessions/s3e/sew-iwcps/committee      To the Ada-Belgium home page.
