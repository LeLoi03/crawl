International Conference on  
  Massive Storage Systems  
  and Technology   
  
  Sponsored by Santa Clara University,  
  School of Engineering  
  
  Since the conference was founded, in 1974, by the leading national laboratories, MSST has been a venue for massive-scale storage system designers and implementers, storage architects, researchers, and vendors to share best practices and discuss building and securing the world's largest storage systems for high-performance computing, web-scale systems, and enterprises. | Hosted at  
  Santa Clara University   
  Santa Clara, CA 
  
  MSST returns to Santa Clara University for its 50 th  anniversary!   

  The beautiful Santa Clara University campus    
  
   This site is dedicated to providing historical information about MSST, from its founding in 1974 through 2023. Information for MSST 2024 and subsequent conferences will be included on the Santa Clara University web site:
