 Welcome to the IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality  
  
  The IEEE ISMAR is the leading international academic conference in the fields of Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality. The symposium is organized and supported by the IEEE Computer Society, IEEE VGTC, and ACM SIGCHI.  
 The first ISMAR conference was held in 2002 in Darmstadt, Germany. The creation of the conference emerged from the fusion of two former academic events dedicated to this research field: the International Symposium on Augmented Reality (ISAR) and the International Symposium on Mixed Reality (ISMR).
