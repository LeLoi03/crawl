  IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory 

 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory    

 The IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory, or ISIT, is the flagship conference of the IEEE Information Theory Society. The symposium centers around the presentation of previously unpublished contributions in all of the areas of information theory, including source and channel coding, communication theory and systems, cryptography and security, detection and estimation, networks, pattern recognition and learning, statistics, stochastic processes and complexity, and signal processing. Furthermore, it provides an open forum to discuss and exchange with other researchers on any of these topics.  
 The highlight of ISIT the Shannon Lecture, given by that year's holder of the Shannon Award. The following year's Shannon Award winner is also announced at ISIT.  
 Some people pronounce ISIT as eye-es-eye-tee. Others pronounce it eye-sit. Both pronunciations are acceptable.  
 The list below includes ISITs since 2001. The list of previous event has ISITs since 1950  .
