  Call For Papers   
   
 Under the theme of "Green and Intelligent Communications" IWCMC 2025 will target a wide spectrum of the state-of-the-art as well as emerging topics pertaining to wireless communications, mobile computing, machine learning, and applications of communications and networks. Continuing the great success of previous IWCM events, IWCMC 2025 is anticipated to attract a large number of high-quality submissions and stimulate the cutting-edge research discussions among many academic pioneering researchers/scientists and industrial engineers/leaders from all around the world. The IWCMC 2025 program will feature a number of symposia, workshops, invited presentations, special sessions, and pioneering keynote speakers. Prospective authors are invited to submit original technical papers—up to 6 pages of length, using the EDAS link: https://edas.info/newPaper.php?c=32919 to various IWCMC 2025 Symposia and Workshops for possible publication in the IWCMC 2025 Conference Proceedings. Accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xplore’s scope and quality requirements. Selected papers will be further considered for possible publication in five special issues in the following Journals: Wiley Journal of Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing (WCMC) The International Journal of Sensor Networks (IJSNet) The International Journal of Autonomous and Adaptive Communications Systems (IJAACS) KSII Transactions on Internet and Information Systems Peer-to-Peer Networking & Applications There will also be best paper awards, one best symposium award, and one best Workshop award.
