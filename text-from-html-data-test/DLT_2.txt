 Developments in Language Theory (DLT)  
  
 An International Conference Series under the auspices of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science ( EATCS  )  

 Scope  
 The series of International Conferences Developments in Language Theory  provides a forum for presenting current developments in formal languages and automata. Its scope is very general and includes, among others, the following topics and areas: combinatorial and algebraic properties of words and languages; grammars, acceptors and transducers for strings, trees, graphs, arrays; algebraic theories for automata and languages; codes; efficient text algorithms; symbolic dynamics; decision problems; relationships to complexity theory and logic; picture description and analysis; polyominoes and bidimensional patterns; cryptography; concurrency; cellular automata; bio-inspired computing; quantum computing.

  History

  DLT Award  
 A special DLT award was given to professors Arto Salomaa and Grzegorz Rozenberg during the 20th DLT symposium in Montreal in 2016. The award was given due to their distinguished contributions to automata theory and founding the DLT conference. The award consisted of a DLT Award diploma and an artistic glass work of an owl.  

  Salomaa Prize  
 As a continuation of the DLT Award, an annual prize, named as Salomaa Prize  , was created in 2018. The first prize was awarded in the DLT symposium in Tokyo in 2018. The prize consists of a diploma and 2000 euros prize funded by the University of Turku, the home university of Arto Salomaa. The selection of the winner is decided by an international prize committee  which is appointed by the steering committee of DLT. There is an open call for nominations  .
