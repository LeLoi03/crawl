  Machine learning advances in molecular modeling for understanding biological processes  
   In the last five years, we have seen significant advancements in machine learning algorithms for molecular modeling. These models effectively learn expressive representations enabling us to predict molecular properties, characterize their interactions, and de-novo generate candidates with desired profile. In addition, these models provide powerful new means to study biological systems. In this talk, I will introduce algorithms for learning molecular representations in the context of docking and generation, and discuss their applications to immunology and metabolomics.

  Organic neuromorphic electronics for sensory coding and biohybrid systems  
   Neuromorphic engineering takes inspiration from the efficiency of the brain and focusses on how to utilise its functionality in hardware. However, delivering an efficient technology that is capable of embedding artificial neural networks in hardware remains a significant challenge. Organic electronic materials have shown potential to overcome some of these challenges and at the same time can operate at the interface with biology. This offers promising solutions for the manipulation and the processing of biological signals, with applications ranging from bioinformatics to brain-computer- interfaces and smart robotics.  
  This talk describes state-of-the-art organic neuromorphic devices and provides an overview of the current challenges in the field and attempts to address them. I demonstrate two device concepts based on novel organic mixed-ionic electronic materials and show how we can use these devices in trainable biosensors and smart autonomous robotics.  
  Next to that, organic electronic materials have the potential to operate at the interface with biology. This can pave the way for novel architectures with bio-inspired features, offering promising solutions for the manipulation and the processing of biological signals and potential applications ranging from brain-computer-interfaces to bioinformatics and neurotransmitter-mediated adaptive sensing. I will highlight our recent efforts for such hybrid biological memory devices.

 Applied AI Ethics in the biomedical field  
  
  Aim  
   In the biomedical field, a large number of sensitive personal data is constantly being processed and the decisions made by AI systems have a substantial impact on patients‚Äô lives. It is important to explore the implications of research in the field of Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology and their use in real-life cases. AI systems may, in fact, have a significant impact on multiple stakeholders: researchers, producers, healthcare professionals, patients, and society as a whole, from an ethical, legal, and sociological point of view.  
  Recent research suggests that multiple individuals, especially marginalized groups, are negatively affected by biases and incorrect use of those systems. Furthermore, in the context of the legislative novelties aiming at regulating AI systems worldwide, the whole AI life cycle generates the need for regulatory and ethical compliance to remove biases and address potential risks. AI Auditing, Value Sensitive Design, and Applied Ethics are becoming a necessity rather than a choice.  
  However, the research in these fields has not reached an agreement on how to perform a comprehensive ethical assessment of the whole AI life-cycle, from the data collection to the post-marketing phases. Different fairness metrics, debiasing techniques, and auditing frameworks have been presented over the years.  
 This Special Session aims to gather scholars investigating new directions and ideas in the field of Applied AI Ethics, particularly in the biomedical field  .  
 Scope   
  This Special Session welcomes papers regarding any ethical issue (including interpretability, fairness, and accountability) arising from AI systems; in particular, we are interested in techniques applied in the context of the biological or medical domain.  
 Examples include but are not limited to:  
 Explainable/Interpretable AI systems for medical decision support 
  Right of explanation and Trustworthy AI in the biomedical field√π 
  Biases in AI systems and debiasing techniques 
  Fair methods for data preprocessing 
  Fairness metrics in the context of biomedicine 
  Unbiased data augmentation and privacy-preserving generative models 
  Anonymization and pseudonymization of biobanks 
  How personalized medicine through AI systems can contribute to 
  mitigating discrimination and inequalities in healthcare 
  The use of synthetic data to protect personal data 
  Legal and ethical issues of data collection, data cleaning, feature/variable selection, and other phases of the development 
  Ethical framework for medical AI systems 
  Ownership of patients‚Äô data and conditions for reuse 
  Social consequences of a biased AI model 
  AI regulation proposal and AI models in biomedical research 
  Legal and ethical issues concerning the use of smart robots for surgery 
  Ethical issues of open-source medical AI systems

 Computational and statistical methods for the integrative analysis of biomedical datasets  
  
  Aim  
   The constant innovation of novel measurement technologies has granted the availability of large datasets  describing, with increasing accuracy, complex biological phenomena. These datasets call for the development of computationally scalable algorithms and statistical models that can provide accurate clinical and biological insights in a timely manner.  
  In the last few years, omic sciences have witnessed the development of multiple technological advances that integrate spatiotemporal information in the data-collecting process. These novel measurements are characterized by extraordinary resolution resulting, for instance, in highly detailed images or high-frequency time series. For example, spatial transcriptomics  is a recent class of groundbreaking technologies that allows the measurement of the activity of thousands of genes in a tissue sample and maps where the activity occurs in space. The additional spatial information brought by these protocols grants for the discovery of genes that show spatial patterns of expression variation across the analyzed tissues. Similarly, modern mass spectrometry  techniques provide protein abundance measures and their corresponding time-of-flight for thousands of pixels in a biopsy. This precision enables the detection of small cell subpopulations based on their different protein profiles, even within regions that are indistinguishable at the microscopic level by pathologists.  
  It is clear that integrating additional external information, such as spatiotemporal  features  deriving from the experiment, constitutes an essential task for omic sciences and is a highly relevant asset when analyzing biological data. Therefore, advanced statistical models and efficient bioinformatic algorithms that integrate external sources of information in the analysis are fundamental.  
 This special session seeks to bring together the different perspectives of researchers operating in heterogenous, albeit interrelated, fields. Thus, the session aims to foster and present new ideas to develop more effective approaches that tackle large and complex biological datasets by considering computational, algorithmic, and methodological solutions to open problems.  
 Scope   
  This special session welcomes any contribution describing new approaches and tools that enable designers to effectively harness large amounts of data to analyse complex real-world situations for supporting the decisions of professional medical experts. Examples of possible contributions include, but are not limited to, computational algorithm, unsupervised and supervised AI methods, and statistical methodologies for spatiotemporal dataset, such as:  
 Mass spectrometry data 
  Spatial omics 
  Microbiome data 
  Multi-omics Integration 
  Some examples of methodologies of interest are:  
 Fuzzy inference system 
  Statistical methods for inference on imaging data 
  Uncertainty quantification methods 
  MCMC and Variational Bayes methods for massive data 
  Design AI-empowered tools 
  Cooperative learning
