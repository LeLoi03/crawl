 The International Conference on Information Modelling and Knowledge Bases (EJC)  , formerly the European-Japanese Conference/Seminar on Information Modelling and Knowledge Bases, the Joint Scandinavian Japanese Seminar on Information Modelling and Knowledge Bases, and initially the Scandinavian Research Seminar on Information Modelling and Database Management, brings together experts from different areas of computer science and other disciplines, who have a common interest in understanding and solving problems on information modelling and knowledge bases, as well as applying the results of research to practice. It further recognizes and studies new areas on modelling and knowledge bases to which more attention should be paid. Therefore philosophy and logic, cognitive science, knowledge management, linguistics and management science are relevant areas, too.  
 The series of International Conference on Information Modelling and Knowledge Bases originally started as a co-operation initiative between Japan and Finland  in 1982. The practical operations were then organized by professor Ohsuga in Japan and professors Hannu Kangassalo and Hannu Jaakkola in Finland. Geographical scope has expanded to cover Europe ( European Japanese Conference – EJC  ) and also other countries ( International Conference  ). Workshop characteristic – discussion, time enough for presentations and limited number of participants (50) / papers (30) – is typical to the conference.  
 The papers presented in the conference are published in the Series of “Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence” by IOS Press (Amsterdam). The books “Information Modelling and Knowledge Bases Vol. n” are edited by the Editing Committee of the conference.
