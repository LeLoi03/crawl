 ICDT: The International Conference on Database Theory   

   ICDT is a scientific conference on research on the foundations of database management; it can be seen as the European version of PODS  (the ACM Symposium on Principles of Database Systems). Having a European identity, it is typically held in beautiful historical European locations.  
 ICDT is held jointly with EDBT  (since 2009), following the successful model of SIGMOD / PODS. The conference presents high-quality, peer reviewed research, invited keynote talks (jointly with EDBT), and an invited ICDT lecture.
