 ISSTA/ECOOP'23: Welcome to Seattle and logistics  
   
 Dear ISSTA/ECOOP 2023 participants,  
 We look forward to welcoming you to the joint conference next week.  
 Below are a number of logistical notes as well as guidelines for presenters. (For convenience, this and other communications will appear on the conference website as well.)  
 On behalf of the ISSTA/ECOOP 2023 organizing committee, welcome to Seattle!  
 René Just  
 Light Rail   
 The Seattle Light Rail system is a great option to get around the Seattle area and to the University of Washington. There is a station conveniently located at the SeaTac airport (from baggage claim, head up to 4th floor and use the skybridge to cross to the parking garage, and follow signs to Link Light Rail), and the line goes directly to downtown Seattle and the University of Washington. Light Rail and bus tickets can be easily purchased via the Transit GO Ticket app  or at ticket kiosks located in the station. Light Rail tickets are $7 for all day use, or $2.25 to $3.50 per one-way trip.  
 Bus   
 Seattle has extensive bus route systems. You can use Seattle Metro’s convenient Trip Planning site  to plan your route. Tickets can be purchased via the Transit GO Ticket app  or with $2.75 exact change when boarding the bus.  
 Parking on Campus   
 Paid parking is available on the University of Washington campus. If you are driving to campus, it is recommended to factor in 20-30 minutes for finding parking and walking to your destinations, as the Allen and Gates buildings are 0.4 miles (0.6 km) from all parking garages. Information about parking fees can be found on ]UW’s Transportation]( https://transportation.uw.edu/park/visitor  ) website. Parking permits can be purchased at UW Gatehouses or by phone via the PayByPhone App  .  
 Addresses   
 Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science and Engineering (Allen Center) 185 E Stevens Way NE Seattle, WA 98195  
 Bill & Melinda Gates Center for Computer Science and Engineering (Gates Center) 3800 E Stevens Way NE Seattle, WA 98195  
 (The two buildings are adjacent, though the street numbers may suggest otherwise.)  
 Registration   
 Please pick up your conference badge and registration package at the registration desk in the Allen Center. Just enter the building through the sliding doors, and the reception desk will be in front of you. The registration desk will be staffed between 8am and 5pm, Monday through Thursday, and between 8am and noon on Friday.  
 Technical Program   
 You can find a program overview and details for the entire week on the ISSTA/ECOOP website  . (The programs on the ISSTA and ECOOP website instances are in sync with the overall program, but provide a view that is tailored to each conference.)  
 Guidelines for presenters   
 In-person presentations:  Presentation slots are 15 minutes (unless differently indicated by your track chair). Please follow the instructions provided to you by your track chair to allow for enough time for Q&A. Please go to your allocated room 15 minutes before the session start time to meet with the Session Chair (see technical program), review the pronunciation of your name, and familiarize yourself with the room and A/V set up, if needed (see Rehearsal and equipment check). You are expected to use your own laptop for presentations, which needs to be connected via HDMI. Some dongles (USB-C) may be available but bring your own adapter if needed. For ISSTA and ECOOP presentations, the A/V system is set up such that it will capture the screen, presenter, and audio, which will be streamed for remote participants via Zoom. Note that you do not need to join a Zoom meeting, simply plug in your device and use the wireless microphone provided. 
  ISSTA-Online presentations:  Presentation slots are 10 minutes. Prepare for 7.5 minutes of presentation and 2.5 minutes of Q&A. You will be required to present via Zoom. Please join the zoom meeting for your online session 15 minutes before the session start time. The zoom meeting details will be shared separately before the main conference. To avoid complications, please install the latest Zoom application on your computer and do not present via a web browser. Make sure your Zoom setup is working properly by running the Zoom audio/video test before joining the call. If your presentation contains any audio, you must enable the sharing of audio when sharing your screen. When you have finished your presentation, please stop sharing your screen and mute your microphone. 
  Posters:  Please set up your poster on Tuesday between 3pm and 3:30pm in the Allen Atrium (in time for the first poster session that starts at 3:30pm). All posters can remain in the Allen Atrium until Thursday evening. Easels, poster boards (32x40 inches), and clips will be provided. 
  Rehearsal and equipment check:  We have reserved room G04 for presentation rehearsal and equipment testing. The A/V setup is identical in all conference rooms. If your set up works in G04, it should work everywhere. 
  Need Help?   
 Signs and student volunteers (in purple shirts) will guide you and help you find your way around campus. If you need additional help or support, please let a staff member at the registration desk know or email April and René.  

 Online sessions and Zoom links  
   
 Dear ISSTA/ECOOP 2023 participants,  
 Below are four meeting links for joining the conference remotely, grouped by conference room. These links are valid for the entire week, and each meeting will start at 10:15am (PDT) on any given day. Please see the online program  for details regarding sessions, rooms, and presentation order.  
 For online presenters   
 Please make sure to virtually join your meeting room 15 minutes prior to the start of your session to connect with your session chair and a student volunteer in the (physical) conference room.  
 For in-person participants   
 All remote presentations are streamed in the physical conference rooms (in the order as listed in the program). In-person participants will be able to ask questions using a wireless microphone and do not need to connect to Zoom.
