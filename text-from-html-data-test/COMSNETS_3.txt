  Lessons Learned: | An exploration of the challenges encountered, solutions devised, and knowledge gained throughout the experimental journey. 
  Implications for Further Research: | Discussion on how the findings can influence future research directions and methodologies. 
  Experience Papers | must adhere to the same submission guidelines as research papers, including an | ‚ÄúExperience‚Äù | prefix in the title for clear differentiation. 

 Submitting a Paper    
  Submissions will be judged on novelty, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and correctness. Accepted papers will optionally be shepherded through an editorial review process by a member of the program committee. COMSNETS uses double-blind reviewing.   
   
  A high-quality paper should:  
 Identify and elucidate a significant problem or challenge within its domain. 
  Offer a novel and captivating solution that piques interest and sparks discussion. 
  Showcase the practicality and advantages of the proposed solution through concrete evidence and real-world scenarios. 
  Present well-founded conclusions that logically follow from the research findings. 
  Provide a clear and comprehensive description of the paper‚Äôs contributions to the field. 
  Articulate the advancements achieved beyond the existing body of work, highlighting the innovative aspects of the research. 
  Ensure adherence to the specified page limit, as papers should neither be shorter nor longer than the prescribed length. 
  Accepted papers will generally be available online to registered attendees before the conference. If your accepted paper should not be published prior to the event, please notify [email protected]   . The papers will be available online to everyone beginning on the first day of the conference.  
 All submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication on the COMSNETS 2025 website; rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential.  
 Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty or fraud. Prior or concurrent workshop publication does not preclude publishing a related paper in COMSNETS. Authors should email the program co-chairs, [email protected]   , a copy of the related workshop paper and a short explanation of the new material in the conference paper beyond that published in the workshop version.  
 ArXiv Policy: Prior or concurrent publication in non-peer-reviewed contexts, like arXiv.org, technical reports, talks, and social media posts, is permitted. However, your COMSNETS submission must use an anonymized name for your project or system that differs from any used in such contexts.  
 By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it. If your paper is accepted and you need an invitation letter to apply for a visa to attend the conference, please contact [email protected]   as soon as possible.
