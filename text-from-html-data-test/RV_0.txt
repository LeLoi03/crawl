 Objectives and Scope  
 Runtime verification is concerned with the monitoring and analysis of the runtime behaviour of software and hardware systems. Runtime verification techniques are crucial for system correctness, reliability, and robustness; they provide an additional level of rigor and effectiveness compared to conventional testing and are generally more practical than exhaustive formal verification. Runtime verification can be used prior to deployment, for testing verification, and debugging purposes, and after deployment for ensuring reliability, safety, and security and for providing fault containment and recovery as well as online system repair. The topics of the conference include, but are not limited to: specification languages for monitoring 
  monitor construction techniques 
  program instrumentation 
  logging, recording, and replay 
  combination of static and dynamic analysis 
  specification mining and machine learning over runtime traces 
  monitoring techniques for concurrent and distributed systems 
  runtime checking of privacy and security policies 
  metrics and statistical information gathering 
  program/system execution visualization 
  fault localization, containment, resilience, recovery and repair 
  systems with learning-enabled components 
  dynamic type checking and assurance cases 
  runtime verification for autonomy and runtime assurance 
  Application areas of runtime verification include cyber-physical systems, autonomous systems safety/mission critical systems, enterprise and systems software, cloud systems, reactive control systems, health management and diagnosis systems, and system security and privacy.
