 A NOTICE FROM THE PC CHAIR  
 As the PC Chair of CSR 2022, I am writing to clarify that despite having "Russia" in its full name, the conference is a purely scientific endeavor, not affiliated with any government. The current plan of the PC is to continue the evaluation of the submitted papers, publish a list of accepted papers, prepare proceedings to be published in Springer's LNCS series, and  hold the conference as an online meeting open to everyone.  
 PURPOSE AND SCOPE  
 CSR is an annual conference that intends to reflect the broad scope of international cooperation in computer science. In 2006-2009 the symposium consisted of two tracks: Theory Track and Applications and Technology Track, and since 2010 it has a single track. The topics covered vary from year to year, but in general try to cover as much of the contemporary computer science as possible.  
 IMPORTANT DATES  
 Deadline for submissions: January 22, 2022 (AoE).
