 Early registration is closed, but regular registration is open! Register before October 4th for the ASSETS'23 conference on the CVENT Registration Site  . We can't wait to have you join us at ASSETS’23!  

 Registration Overview  
 Registrations for conferences can be complicated, reflecting an array of options and time-contingent fee structures. ASSETS is no different. Allow us to help make sense of things. We have:  
 Four registration types: | (1) ACM member, (2) non-member, (3) student ACM member, | and | (4) student non-member. | If you are not yet an ACM member, it often makes financial sense to become one. See | ACM's membership options here | . 
  Three registration deadlines | that affect pricing: | (1) early, (2) regular, (3) late. | Generally it's best to register early to save costs and to help us plan events. 
  Two conference experiences: | (1) the | in-person conference | in New York City or (2) a (very) lighterweight, | asynchronous virtual option | for those that cannot travel due to personal preference or scheduling. See the | Attending Overview page | for details. 
  Below, we expand on each option and provide pricing.  

 In-Person Conference  
 ASSETS'23 is planned primarily as an in-person event with an asynchronous option for individuals to view pre-recorded videos and engage in discussion on Discord. Please see the Attending Overview  page for details.  
 This hybrid model was used at ASSETS’22 in Athens, Greece  . the in-person conference experience will be similar to previous in-person ASSETS conferences such as ASSETS'18 in Galway, Ireland  or ASSETS'19 in Pittsburgh, PA  .  
 There will be in-person talks, poster and demo sessions 
  Additional details about the virtual portion of the conference will be posted soon. 
  More details will be shared as the day of the conference gets closer. 
   
 At least one author of accepted technical papers, posters and demonstrations, or other artifact-based tracks is expected to travel to New York City to present their work. If traveling to ASSETS is inaccessible to you or presents an insurmountable COVID health/safety risk for you, please email General Chair  , and we can find ways to accommodate you.  
  
 Delegate Type | Early Registration (08/25) | Regular Registration (10/04) | Late Registration 
 ACM/SIG Member | $675.00 | $855.00 | $1020.00 
 Non-Member | $825.00 | $1020.00 | $1130.00

 Cancellation policy: if you cancel your in-person conference registration by Sept 5th, we will provide a 50% refund. All in-person registrants also get access to virtual content. If you test positive for COVID before the conference that prevents travel, you can use our virtual option; however, we will not provide a reimbursement for the cost difference.   

 Virtual Option  
 ASSETS'23 will offer a lightweight virtual option for those authors and attendees that cannot travel to New York due to COVID health or accessibility concerns. More details will be provided soon as the conference day gets closer.

 Virtual Workshops
