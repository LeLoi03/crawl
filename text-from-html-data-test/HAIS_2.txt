 haisconference.eu | The 18th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems (HAIS 2023)  combines symbolic and sub-symbolic techniques to construct more robust and reliable problem solving models. Hybrid intelligent systems are popular due to their capabilities in handling many real world complex problems, involving imprecision, uncertainty and vagueness, high-dimensionality. They provide us with the opportunity to use both our knowledge and row data to solve problems in a more interesting and promising way. HAIS series of conferences provides an interesting opportunity to present and discuss the latest theoretical advances and real-world applications in this multidisciplinary research field. | haisconference.eu | The 18th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems (HAIS 2023)  combines symbolic and sub-symbolic techniques to construct more robust and reliable problem solving models.

 Select a topic of interest to conference delegates. 
  Obtain papers on this topic, normally a minimum of 5 for an invited special session, but often more. At least 60% of the papers must be by authors that are neither session chairs, from their team nor reviewers for the session. 
  If there are not sufficient papers, final accepted papers will be moved to the general track. 
  Manage the review process for these papers on due time and deadlines. 
  Provide suitable reviewers for the reviews of the papers. 
  Ensure the final versions of the papers are uploaded before the deadline. 
  Attend the conference and chair the session. 
  Disseminate widely a call for papers for the special session.
