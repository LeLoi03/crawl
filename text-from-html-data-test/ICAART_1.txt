 The purpose of the International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence is to bring together researchers, engineers and practitioners interested in the theory and applications in the areas of Agents and Artificial Intelligence, covering both applications and current research work. On one side it focuses on Agents, Multi-Agent Systems and Software Platforms, and also Distributed Problem Solving. On the other side it focuses on Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge Representation, Planning, Learning, Scheduling, Perception. Applications are in both areas. They are using Natural Language Processing (NLP), Legal Technologies and Quantum Computing.  
   
  The last four years the research emphasis has shifted towards Explainable AI and Interpretable AI with a focus on trustworthiness, fairness, privacy, safety, security and ethical issues. A substantial amount of research work is ongoing in these knowledge areas, in an attempt to discover appropriate theories and paradigms to use in real-world applications.
