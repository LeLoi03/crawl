  The 31st Annual Intelligent Systems For Molecular Biology and the 22nd Annual European Conference on Computational Biology  
  
 ISMB/ECCB 2023 was an incredibly successful and memorable event! With nearly 2,600 participants from various countries, both in-person and online attendance, it was a diverse and engaging experience. The impressive number of talks, panel discussions, and posters shows the depth and breadth of scientific content covered during the conference. The Ideation Hall, where participants could interact with exhibitors, provided a great opportunity for networking, job exploration and exploring new ideas and technologies. ISMB/ECCB 2023 wouldn't be possible without the dedication and hard work of volunteers, and it's heartening to see their efforts being acknowledged. Steven Leard's long-term commitment to the conference is also commendable. ISCB wishes him all the best in his retirement from ISCB. Plan now to join us in 2024 in Montreal, Canada, July 12-16. ISMB/ECCB 2023 is a highlight of the summer for the scientific community, and the upcoming conference in Montreal holds promising prospects for further scientific advancement and collaboration.  
 Thank you French Society for Bioinformatics ( https://www.sfbi.fr/  ) for sharing with us your thought-provoking science and French culture.  
 About ISMB:  
  ISMB/ECCB is the largest and most high profile annual meeting of scientists working in computational biology and provides an intense multidisciplinary forum for disseminating the latest developments in computational tools for data driven biological research. The conference’s rigorous focus on computation and methodology coupled with outstanding biology is a must attend event of the year! This year is a very special year for ISMB/ECCB, as the conference will have a close collaboration with the French Society for Bioinformatics ( https://www.sfbi.fr/  ). ISMB/ECCB 2023 in collaboration with SFBI will spike your curiosity, deliver the latest research in the field, and allow you to connect, collaborate, and engage.  
 ISMB/ECCB 2023 was held in-person at the Centre de Congrès de Lyon and virtually through ISCB's Nucleus platform.
