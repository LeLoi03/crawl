  How customer reviews and ratings work   Customer Reviews, including Product Star Ratings, help customers to learn more about the product and decide whether it is the right product for them.  
 To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyses reviews to verify trustworthiness.
