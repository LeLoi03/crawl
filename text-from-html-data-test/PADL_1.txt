 Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages  
   
 All Editions   

 Sun 19 - Sat 25 January 2025 Denver, Colorado, United States  PADL 2025  with POPL 2025    
 Declarative languages comprise several well-established classes of formalisms, namely, functional, logic, and constraint programming. Such formalisms enjoy both sound theoretical bases and the availability of attractive frameworks for application development. Indeed, they have been already successfully applied to many different real-world situations, ranging from database management to active networks to software ...
