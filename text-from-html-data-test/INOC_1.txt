 INOC 2024 takes place in University College Dublin, Ireland, 11th-13th March 2024. This is the final call for papers. We invite you to submit extended abstracts or short papers in Network Optimisation up to 10th December 2023. Full details are on the conference website: https://inoc2024.sciencesconf.org/  .  
 INOC solicits contributions in the broad field of Network Optimization from the areas of Mathematical Optimization, Operations Research, and Graph Theory. Application-oriented network optimization from areas like Telecommunications, Routing, Smart Grids, and Logistics are most welcome.  
 We have an exciting scientific programme including keynote talks from Prof.s Ivana Ljubic (ESSEC Business School), Bernardetta Addis (Université de Lorraine), and Stefan Schmid (TU Berlin), and a tutorial on Smart Grids from Eaton.  
 In addition, we have a nice social programme planned and look forward to welcoming you to Dublin!
