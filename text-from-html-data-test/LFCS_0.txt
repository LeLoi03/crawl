 LFCS 2022  

 Due to the current wave of the pandemic, LFCS 2022 was held in the online format.   The list of talks with links to their videos is at the bottom of this page.  
 The Springer LFCS 2022 volume, LNCS 13137, is now available online and can be accessed at http://link.springer.com/openurl.asp?genre=issue&issn=0302-9743&volume=13137  .  

 About LFCS  
 The LFCS series provides an outlet for the fast-growing body of work in the logical foundations of computer science, e.g., areas of fundamental theoretical logic related to computer science. The LFCS series began with Logic at Botik, Pereslavl-Zalessky, 1989 and was co-organized by Albert R. Meyer (MIT) and Michael Taitslin (Tver), after which organization passed to Anil Nerode in 1992. LFCS has enjoyed support and endorsements from a number of bodies, including the US National Science Foundation (NSF), Association for Symbolic Logic (ASL), Cornell University, and the City University of New York Research Foundation.

 The Rosser Prize  
 The LFCS series has the best student paper award, The Rosser Prize, named after John Barkley Rosser Sr. (1907–1989), a prominent American logician with fundamental contributions in both Mathematics and Computer Science.  
 The Rosser Prize from LFCS 2022 goes to two student authors  
 Yannick Forster  , Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany. “Parametric Church’s Thesis: Synthetic Computability Without Choice”   
 Daniel Rogozin  , Institute for Information Transmission Problems, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia. “Reducts of Relation Algebras: The Aspects of Axiomatisability And Finite Representability.”   
 Both of these papers and their authors are declared the winners. Congratulations!
