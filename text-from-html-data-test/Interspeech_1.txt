 Searching uses the 'and' of terms e.g. Smith Interspeech  matches all papers by Smith in any Interspeech. The order of terms is not significant.  
 Use double quotes for exact phrasal matches e.g. "acoustic features"  .  
 Case is ignored.  
 Diacritics are optional e.g. lefevre  also matches lefèvre  (but not vice versa).  
 It can be useful to turn off spell-checking for the search box in your browser preferences.
