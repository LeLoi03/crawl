  Please note that the deadline to submit the final version of your paper is December 2, 2024.  
 This yearâ€™s conference was a great success, thanks to the quality of the papers presented and the outstanding efforts of the authors, special session organizers, session chairs, and invited speakers. We look forward to seeing you again in 2025!  
  Conference Presentation/Publication Policy  
 The proceedings of the Asilomar conference are meant to be a written record of the presentations provided at the conference. In other words, these proceedings are not a medium for general publication of scientific results; rather, they serve a more specific and narrow purpose which is to summarize the discussions that occurred during the Conference.  
 It is the long-term Conference policy to restrict publication in the proceedings to papers which were presented live  at the conference by one of the registered  authors of the paper who is physically present at the conference. There is no exception to this policy.  
 No more than 4 papers (combination of invited and regular) papers per author or co-author will be accepted for presentation at the conference or published in the proceedings.  
 The conference executive committee and IEEE reserve the right to exclude a final paper submission from inclusion in the conference proceedings, if the final paper submission does not meet conference or IEEE standards for scope and/or quality.  
  The Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers is a yearly Conference held on the Asilomar Grounds in Pacific Grove CA, USA. The IEEE Signal Processing Society is a technical co-sponsor. It provides a forum for presenting recent and novel work in various areas of theoretical and applied signal processing.  
 General areas of interest to the forum include:  
 Architectures & Implementation 
  Array Signal Processing 
  Biomedical Signal & Image Processing 
  Communication Systems 
  MIMO Communications & Signal Processing 
  Networks & Graphs 
  Signal Processing & Adaptive Systems 
  Machine Learning & Data Analytics 
  Speech, Image & Video Processing 
   
 Recent meetings have presented a wide array of work ranging from results in MIMO communications, array processing, low dimensional signal models, blind source separation, tensor models, stochastic optimization, online and distributed learning, and signal processing over graphs to applications of signal processing in control, wireless communications, financial engineering, smart grids, biological systems, medical imaging, and big data.
