 4th IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems - ACSOS 2023  
   
 The IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems (ACSOS) is the leading forum to share the latest research results, ideas and experiences in autonomic computing, self-adaptation and self-organization. Now in its 4th edition, ACSOS was founded in 2020 as a merger of the IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC) and the IEEE International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems (SASO).  
 The world is increasingly embracing autonomous systems: in robotics, manufacturing, software engineering, vehicles, data center systems, and precision agriculture to name just a few areas. These systems are bringing autonomy to a whole new level of dynamic decision-making under uncertainty, requiring autonomic behavior (e.g., control theory, cybernetics) and self-reference, leading to a range of self-* properties (e.g., self-awareness, self-adaptation, self-organization), and an approach in which system implementation and its environment are holistically considered.
