 International Conference on  
  Flexible Query Answering Systems (FQAS)  
 FQAS is the premier conference focusing on the key issue in the information society of providing flexible, easy, and (for human) intuitive access to information. In targeting this issue, the conference draws on several research areas, such as information retrieval, database management, data science, information filtering, knowledge representation, logics, uncertainty handling, knowledge discovery, analytics, soft computing, management of multimedia information, and human-computer interaction.  
 The guiding topic of the FQAS conferences are innovative query systems aimed at providing easy, flexible and human-friendly access to information. Such systems are becoming increasingly important also due to the huge and always growing number of users as well as the growing amount of available information.  
 Since 1994, the conference has provided a unique and multidisciplinary forum for researchers, developers and practitioners to explore and exchange new ideas and approaches in all mentioned research areas.
