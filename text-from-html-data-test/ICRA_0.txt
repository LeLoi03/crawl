 Dear participants,  
 As the General Chair of ICRA 2023, it gives me great pleasure to express my heartfelt gratitude to all participants. As the conference is drawing to a close, we can look back at the remarkable success we have achieved during this week. Without your unswerving commitment and dedication this would not have been possible.  
 I send my appreciation to all the participants. Your undeterred dedication to advancing knowledge, sharing insights, and fostering collaboration has been truly inspiring. The level of engagement and the quality of discussions witnessed during the conference were beyond our wildest expectations. Your active participation and contribution have undeniably elevated the impact and significance of this ICRA.  
 I would also like to thank our esteemed partners for providing support and contributions – an essential ingredient in making ICRA 2023 a triumph. Your invaluable insights, resources, and expertise have advanced the dissemination of knowledge and the translation of research. We are very grateful for your excellent commitment.  
 It gives me also great pleasure to let you know that with 6000 attendees overall, we have broken all previous records. This clearly underlines the ever-growing significance and impact of ICRA. Your presence here has not only contributed to the success of this conference but has also fostered a vibrant community that will, I am sure, continue to collaborate. Following the conference’s motto “Embracing the future: Making robots for humans”, let us continue to push the boundaries of knowledge, inspire one another, and work together to shape a better world.  
 Thank you again for your noteworthy contributions.  
 Best regards,  
 Kaspar Althoefer   
 General Chair
