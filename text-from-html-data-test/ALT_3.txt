 ±  Niki Hasrati and Shai Ben-David receive best paper award at ALT 2023   
   
 Tuesday, February 14, 2023    
   
 Master’s candidate Niki Hasrati and Professor Shai Ben-David have received the best paper award  at ALT 2023  , the 34 th  International Conference on Algorithmic Learning Theory. This year the annual meeting that explores the theoretical and algorithmic aspects of machine learning will take place in Singapore from February 20 to 23.  
 Their paper, “ On Computable Online Learning  ,” studies online learning with computable learners. It analyzes that question under various requirements for successful learning. The paper gives a necessary and sufficient condition for optimal computable online learning and shows that the Littlestone dimension  — a combinatorial parameter that characterizes online learnability without computability requirements — no longer applies when the learners are required to be computable.

 The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the Office of Indigenous Relations  .
