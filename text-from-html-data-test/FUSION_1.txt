 For the last decade, Travel & Leisure   readers have rated Charleston the #1 city in the United States  . The city was founded in 1670 and has preserved a rich history from the American Revolutionary and Civil Wars. Characterized by walkable cobblestone streets, southern plantations and horse-drawn carriages, historic churches, world-renowned restaurants and pubs, and all the sights of a waterfront port city and prior naval base, Charleston is a destination to satisfy just about any craving!  

 The conference will be held at the Charleston Place Hotel,  which is in the center of the King Street historic district adjacent to the City Market, Old Exchange, Provost Dungeon, and Gibbs Museum of Art. The venue is only a short distance from the Battery Promenade and Waterfront Parks overlooking the Charleston Harbor and Fort Sumter, where the first shots of the Civil War were fired.  

 Finally, numerous renowned golf courses, barrier island beaches, and national parks are only a short drive away.  Come and let us share our southern hospitality!  

 See y'all in Charleston!
