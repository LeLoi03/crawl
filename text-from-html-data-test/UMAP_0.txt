ACM UMAP is the successor to the biennial User Modeling (UM) and Adaptive Hypermedia and Adaptive Web-based Systems (AH) conferences that were merged in 2009. It is sponsored by ACM SIGCHI and SIGWEB, and organized with User Modeling Inc. as the Steering Committee. The proceedings are published by ACM and will be part of the ACM Digital Library.
