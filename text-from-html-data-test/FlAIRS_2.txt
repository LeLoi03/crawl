 ... The naı¨ve assumption is that all such structural features can effectively be treated as independent. It is known that Bayesian classifiers can achieve excellent results even if the independence of the features is questionable ( Zhang, 2004  ). ...

 The carboxylation of lysine residues is a post-translational modification (PTM) that plays a critical role in the catalytic mechanisms of several important enzymes. It occurs spontaneously under certain physicochemical conditions, but is difficult to detect experimentally. Its full impact is unknown. In this work, the signature microenvironment of lysine-carboxylation sites has been characterized. In addition, a computational method called Predictor of Lysine Carboxyl­ation (PreLysCar) for the detection of lysine carboxylation in proteins with available three-dimensional structures has been developed. The likely prevalence of lysine carboxylation in the proteome was assessed through large-scale computations. The results suggest that about 1.3% of large proteins may contain a carboxylated lysine residue. This unexpected prevalence of lysine carboxylation implies an enrichment of reactions in which it may play functional roles. The results also suggest that by switching enzymes on and off under appropriate physicochemical conditions spontaneous PTMs may serve as an important and widely used efficient biological machinery for regulation.

 In this article we present GeoTxt, a scalable geoparsing system for the recognition and geolocation of place names in unstructured text. GeoTxt offers six named entity recognition (NER) algorithms for place name recognition, and utilizes an enterprise search engine for the indexing, ranking, and retrieval of toponyms, enabling scalable geoparsing for streaming text. GeoTxt offers a flexible application programming interface (API), allowing for customized attribute and/or spatial ranking of retrieved toponyms. We evaluate the system on a corpus of manually geo‐annotated tweets. First, we benchmark the performance of the six NERs that GeoTxt provides access to. Second, we assess GeoTxt toponym resolution accuracy incrementally, demonstrating improvements in toponym resolution achieved (or not achieved) by adding specific heuristics and disambiguation methods. Compared to using the GeoNames web service, GeoTxt's toponym resolution demonstrates a 20% accuracy gain. Our results show that places mentioned in the same tweet do not tend to be geographically proximate.

 Compound Classification Using the scikit-learn Library

 This chapter includes a tutorial demonstrating the use of different machine learning models for binary classification problems including naïve Bayes, decision trees, and support vector machines, and discussing their applicability to nonlinear data, interpretability, use for multi-class problems, and computational complexity. The software used by the tutorial is Python with packages NumPy, scikit-learn, and optionally pydot. The tutorial shows how to derive different models from labeled training data, and to apply these models on the test data. While naïve Bayes is a generative model, meaning that it derives full probabilities for all variables, decision trees and support vector machines are discriminative models. The naïve Bayes classifier can easily be applied without many parameter choices, whereas decision trees and support vector machines require careful parameter selection. In terms of computational complexity, support vector machines usually require much longer training time than naïve Bayes and decision tree classifiers, which can be trained in linear time.

 GUACAMOLE: A new paradigm for unsupervised competitive learning

 It is well known that learning is a truly complex phenomenon. There are many different forms of learning, and their codification is far from straightforward. In the AI-oriented literature (and in particular for Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)), the basic distinction that prevails to classify the variety of possibilities at a very basic level is that between supervised and unsupervised learning. In the supervised form, learners are subject to schemes of rewards and punishments that are conditional to the achievement of an external, pre-determined target, and the level of reward/ punishment depends on the level of achievement of the target subject to a certain metric. In the unsupervised form, learners are free from predetermined targets and from external enforcement, and they have to derive an endogenous, idiosyncratic categorization of the phenomenon. One can imagine several hybrid forms where either the prescription value of the target or the operation of the reward system (or both) are loosened to allow for some degree of autonomy of the learner's information acquisition and categorization strategy (Chapelle et al. 2006; Zhu and Goldberg 2009). In the case of reinforcement learning, for instance, the learner generally knows nothing about the objective of the learning process but is exter-nally rewarded/punished depending on the actions undertaken, and it is the actual greed for reward/aversion for reinforcement that drives the whole learning process
