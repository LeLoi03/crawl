 Conference Information  
  
 AIED 2023 will be the 24th edition and the 30th anniversary of the International AIED Society. The AIED Society organises the AIED conference and is aimed at advancing science and engineering of intelligent human-technology ecosystems that support learning. The conference will be the latest of a longstanding series of international conferences, known for high quality and innovative research on AI-assisted systems and cognitive science approaches for educational computing applications.  
 This year's theme is "AI in Education for Sustainable Society." A sustainable society is driven by the principle of realising peace and prosperity for all people and the planet with an inclusiveness that “leaves no one behind.” We invite authors to present research on how AI in education can help our society meet its need to provide inclusive and equitable quality education and to promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.
