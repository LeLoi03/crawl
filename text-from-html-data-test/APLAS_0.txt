 Introduction   
 The 21st Asian Symposium on Programming Languages and Systems  ( APLAS  ) aims to stimulate programming language research by providing a forum for the presentation of the latest results and the exchange of ideas in programming languages and systems. APLAS is based in Asia but is an international forum that serves the worldwide programming languages community. This year’s conference is co-located with Agda Implementors’ Meeting XXXVII  .  
 APLAS 2023 was held in Taipei, Taiwan  from Monday 27th to Wednesday 29th November 2023. Before the main conference, the New Ideas and Emerging Results (NIER)  workshop was held on Sunday 26th November 2023. There was also a student research competition and an associated poster session  .  
 APLAS is organized by the Asian Association for Foundation of Software (AAFS)  , founded by Asian researchers in cooperation with many researchers from Europe and the USA. Past APLAS symposiums were held in Auckland (’22), Chicago (’21), Fukuoka (’20), Bali (’19), Wellington (’18), Suzhou (’17), Hanoi (’16), Pohang (’15), Singapore (’14), Melbourne (’13), Kyoto (’12), Kenting (’11), Shanghai (’10), Seoul (’09), Bangalore (’08), Singapore (’07), Sydney (’06), Tsukuba (’05), Taipei (’04) and Beijing (’03) after three informal workshops.  
 Conference Proceedings   
 Proceedings of APLAS 2023 is published by Springer as part of Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS), volume 14405.  
 Springer provides free access to the conference proceedings for APLAS participants until 31 December 2023, through the following link:

  Submission Information   
 Submissions should not exceed 17  pages, excluding bibliography in the Springer LNCS format  . LaTeX template is available at Springer’s Information for Authors  .  
 The accepted papers will be allowed to use one extra page  for the content to accommodate feedback from the reviews in the final paper versions.  
 Papers should be submitted via HotCRP: https://aplas2023.hotcrp.com/  .  
 The review process of APLAS 2023 is double-anonymous  , with a rebuttal phase. In your submission, please, omit your names and institutions; refer to your prior work in the third person, just as you refer to prior work by others; do not include acknowledgments that might identify you.  
 Additional material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final version – for example, details of proofs – may be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page limit. Reviewers are at liberty to ignore appendices and papers must be understandable without them.  
 Submitted papers must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers must be written in English. Accepted papers must be presented at the conference.  
 The proceedings will be published as a volume in Springer’s LNCS series  . Previous APLAS proceedings  can be found on SpringerLink. Authors interested in making their contributions Open Access please refer to Springer’s webpage  for additional information.  
 Distinguished Paper Awards   
 Around 10% of the accepted papers of APLAS 2023 will be designated as Distinguished Papers  , which highlights papers that the Program Committee recommends due to their excellent quality. The awards will be announced on this website, and printed certificates will be issued to the authors in the conference.

 Time Band   
   
 By setting a time band, the program will dim events that are outside this time window. This is useful for (virtual) conferences with a continuous program (with repeated sessions).  
  The time band will also limit the events that are included in the personal iCalendar subscription service.   Display full program    Specify a time band   -
