 Overview  
 Top Research Topics at Virtual Reality Software and Technology?  
 Virtual reality (40.37%) 
  Artificial intelligence (33.01%) 
  Computer vision (30.96%) 
  The topics of Virtual reality, Artificial intelligence, Computer vision, Human–computer interaction and Computer graphics (images) are the focal point of discussions in the conference. The conference holds forums on Virtual reality that merges themes from other disciplines such as Virtual machine, Multimedia and Simulation, Haptic technology. Many of the studies tackled connect Multimedia with a similar field of study like Metaverse.  
 The in-depth study on Artificial intelligence also explores topics in the intersecting field of Animation. While work presented in the event provided substantial information on Computer vision, it also covered topics in Perception and Position (vector). While Human–computer interaction is the focus of Virtual Reality Software and Technology, it also provided insights into the studies of Visualization, Interface (computing) and Gesture.  
 Rendering (computer graphics) works presented in Virtual Reality Software and Technology have a specific focus on Real-time rendering. The conference features studies on Mixed reality, including topics such as Computer-mediated reality.  
 What are the most cited papers published at the conference?  
 Taking steps: the influence of a walking technique on presence in virtual reality (532 citations) 
  VRPN: a device-independent, network-transparent VR peripheral system (435 citations) 
  MASSIVE: a collaborative virtual environment for teleconferencing (368 citations) 
  Research areas of the most cited articles at Virtual Reality Software and Technology:  
 The conference articles mainly deal with areas of study such as Virtual reality, Artificial intelligence, Human–computer interaction, Computer vision and Computer graphics (images). The published articles focus on Virtual reality but the discussions also offer insight into other areas such as Augmented reality, Orientation (computer vision), Immersion (virtual reality) and Simulation, Haptic technology. The conference articles explore topics in Human–computer interaction which can be helpful for research in disciplines like Object (computer science), Virtual machine, Multimedia and Interface (computing).  
 Papers citation over time  
 A key indicator for each conference is its effectiveness in reaching other researchers with the papers published at that venue.  
 The chart below presents the interquartile range (first quartile 25%, median 50% and third quartile 75%) of the number of citations of articles over time.

 Publication chance based on affiliation  
 The publication chance index shows the ratio of articles published by the best research institutions at the conference edition to all articles published within that conference. The best research institutions were selected based on the largest number of articles published during all editions of the conference.  
 The chart below presents the percentage ratio of articles from top institutions (based on their ranking of total papers).Top affiliations were grouped by their rank into the following tiers: top 1-10, top 11-20, top 21-50, and top 51+. Only articles with a recognized affiliation are considered.  

 Research.com  

 During the most recent 2018 edition, 3.76%  of publications had an unrecognized affiliation. Out of the publications with recognized affiliations, 13.28%  were posted by at least one author from the top 10 institutions publishing at the conference. Another 8.59%  included authors affiliated with research institutions from the top 11-20 affiliations. Institutions from the 21-50 range included 30.47%  of all publications and 47.66%  were from other institutions.  
 Returning Authors Index  
 A very common phenomenon observed among researchers publishing scientific articles is the intentional selection of conferences they have already attended in the past. In particular, it is worth analyzing the case when the authors participate in the same conference from year to year.  
 The Returning Authors Index presented below illustrates the ratio of authors who participated in both a given as well as the previous edition of the conference in relation to all participants in a given year.

 Returning Institution Index  
 The graph below shows the Returning Institution Index, illustrating the ratio of institutions that participated in both a given and the previous edition of the conference in relation to all affiliations present in a given year.

 The experience to innovation index  
 Our experience to innovation index was created to show a cross-section of the experience level of authors publishing at a conference. The index includes the authors publishing at the last edition of a conference  , grouped by total number of publications throughout their academic career (P) and the total number of citations of these publications ever received (C).  
 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups:  
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25), 
  Competent - P < 10 or C < 100 (the number of publications less than 10 or the number of citations less than 100), 
  Experienced - P < 25 or C < 625 (the number of publications less than 25 or the number of citations less than 625), 
  Master - P < 50 or C < 2500 (the number of publications less than 50 or the number of citations less than 2500), 
  Star - P ≥ 50 and C ≥ 2500 (both the number of publications greater than 50 and the number of citations greater than 2500). 

 The chart below illustrates experience levels of first authors in cases of publications with multiple authors.
