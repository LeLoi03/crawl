 Welcome to SAFEPROCESS 2022  
   
 The Organizing Committee has the pleasure of inviting you to participate in the 11th IFAC Symposium on Fault Detection, Supervision and Safety for Technical Processes, to take place in Pafos, Cyprus, 8-10 June 2022  under the auspices of IFAC, the International Federation of Automatic Control.   
 SAFEPROCESS is organized every three years. The previous edition, was held in Warsaw, Poland in 2018. The SAFEPROCESS Symposium is a major international gathering of leading experts in the academia and industry from all over the worlds. It aims at strengthening the contact between the academia and industry to build up new networks and cultivate existing relations.  
 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertain conditions around the world, the organization of SAFEPROCESS has been transferred from 2021 to 2022, after approval from IFAC. We hope that the change in the dates of the Symposium will facilitate wider participation and the organization of a successful and wonderful SAFEPROCESS 2022, comparable with the high standards of previous SAFEPROCESS events.   
 SAFEPROCESS 2022 will be held physically at the Aliathon Resort in Pafos, Cyprus. Physical participation is strongly encouraged, however to accommodate registrants who are unable to attend the Symposium physically due to the COVID pandemic, SAFEPROCESS 2022 will be held in hybrid mode, thereby allowing virtual participation.
