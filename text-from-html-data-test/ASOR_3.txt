 MODSIM2023  
   
 he 25th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM2023) will be held at the Darwin Convention Centre, Darwin, Northern Territory, from Sunday 9 to Thursday 13 July 2023 with a workshop day on Friday 14 July.  
 ASOR  will be joining us again for the National Conference of the Australian Society for Operations Research  . The International Environmental Modelling and Software Society ( iEMSs  ) is supporting two streams and The Open Modeling Foundation  is also supporting a stream.  
 MSSANZ has held biennial congresses since 1974 that typically attract 600–900 participants.  
 To facilitate more effective collaboration, MODSIM2023 will be an in-person event. Plenaries and Keynotes will be live streamed and available to watch free of charge.
