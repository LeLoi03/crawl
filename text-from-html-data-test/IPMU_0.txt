  The 19th International Conference on Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems / July 11-15, 2022 – Milan, Italy  
 The IPMU Conference  is organized every two years since 1986 with the focus of bringing together scientists working on methods for the management of uncertainty and aggregation. It also provides a forum for the exchange of ideas between theoreticians and practitioners in these and related areas.  
 The 2022 edition of IPMU will take place at the University of Milano-Bicocca  , located in the North-East of Milan, in a renewed district that offers a theatre, an exhibition space, and many restaurants and pubs. With the main buildings located close to the Greco Pirelli Railway Station  and the Metro Line 5 (M5)  , the University of Milano-Bicocca benefits from excellent access routes.  
 Milan  is one of the most dynamic cities in the world, and full of stories to tell. A city where you feel safe wandering around day or night, where you’ll find hotels, restaurants, and nightlife to suit every taste, budget, and requirement.
