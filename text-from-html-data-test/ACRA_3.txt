 Call for papers - ACRA 2023  
    
 7 June 2023     

 The  2023 Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation (ACRA 2023)   is jointly organised by the Australian Robotics and Automation Association, UNSW, and the UTS Robotics Institute. The conference will be held in person on 4-6 December 2023 at UNSW Kensington Campus, Sydney.    
 Since 1999, ACRA has brought together Australian and New Zealand researchers and students in robotics, automation, and mechatronics. It provides a forum to present a breadth of research activities to the broader Australasian community. ACRA is a quality, peer-reviewed conference featured in Scopus, Google Scholar, and other ranking engines.    
 All full papers submitted to ACRA 2023 will undergo a peer-review process. Each manuscript will be reviewed by at least two reviewers giving detailed comments. If the submission is accepted, the authors will submit a revised (“camera-ready”) version that takes into account this feedback. All papers are reviewed using a single-blind review process. Papers from all areas of robotics are encouraged.
