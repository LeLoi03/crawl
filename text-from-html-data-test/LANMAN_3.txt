IEEE 802 LMSC |  
  
  The IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee develops and maintains networking standards and recommended practices for local metropolitan, and other area networks, using an open and accredited process, and advocates them on a global basis. The most widely used standards are for Ethernet, Bridging and Virtual Bridged LANs Wireless LAN, Wireless PAN, Wireless MAN, Wireless Coexistence, Media Independent Handover Services, and Wireless RAN. An individual Working Group provides the focus for each area.
