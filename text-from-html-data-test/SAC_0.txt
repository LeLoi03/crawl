  Selected Areas in Cryptography (SAC) is Canada’s research conference on cryptography, held annually since 1994.  
 The 30th edition of SAC will take place at the University of New Brunswick  in Fredericton, New Brunswick Canada from August 16–18, 2023  , and will be preceded by the SAC Summer School  on August 14–15, 2023  .  
  Topics  
 There are four areas covered at each SAC conference. Three of the areas are permanent.  
 Design and analysis of symmetric key primitives and cryptosystems, including block and stream ciphers, hash function, MAC algorithms, cryptographic permutations, and authenticated encryption schemes; 
  Efficient implementations of symmetric and public key algorithms; and 
  Mathematical and algorithmic aspects of applied cryptology. 
  The special selected topic for SAC 2023 is:  
 Counter-measures against side channel attacks in symmetric cryptography. 
  SAC 2023 also welcomes papers in any of the areas above with a focus on post-quantum cryptography.
