 Description  

 PACMPL Issue POPL 2023 seeks contributions on all aspects of programming languages and programming systems, both theoretical and practical. Authors of papers published in PACMPL Issue POPL 2023 will be invited to present their work in the POPL conference in January 2023, which is sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN, in cooperation with ACM SIGACT and ACM SIGLOG.  
   
  This call for contributions is subject to change.  
   
  Scope:  
  Principles of Programming Languages is a forum for the discussion of all aspects of programming languages and programming systems. Both theoretical and experimental papers are welcome, on topics ranging from formal frameworks to experience reports. We seek submissions that make principled, enduring contributions to the theory, design, understanding, implementation or application of programming languages.  
   
  Submission Guidelines:  
  The following two points are easy to overlook:  
  Conflicts: Each author of a submission has to log into the submission system and properly declare all potential conflicts of interest in the author profile form. A conflict caught late in the reviewing process leads to a voided review which may be infeasible to replace.  
  Anonymity: POPL 2023 will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Make sure that your submitted paper is fully anonymized.
