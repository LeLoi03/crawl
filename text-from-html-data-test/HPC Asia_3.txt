 Supercomputing Asia 2023  

  Description  
 The SupercomputingAsia (SCA) conference aims to be a major supercomputing conference in Asia, where top supercomputers in the world are located. Co-organised by supercomputing centres of the region including those in Australia, Japan, Singapore and Thailand and anchored by the National Supercomputing Centre (NSCC) Singapore, it incorporates a number of important supercomputing and allied events that together aim to promote a vibrant and shared high-performance computing (HPC) ecosystem, for both the public and private sectors, in Asia.  
 The International Conference on High Performance Computing in the Asia-Pacific Region (HPC Asia) is an international conference series for the Asia Pacific region on HPC technologies that fosters exchange of ideas, research results and case studies related to all issues of HPC. For the first time ever, HPC Asia 2023 will be co-located with SCA23 in Singapore. The HPC Asia and SCA events synergise the collaborative and collective strengths from two of Asiaâ€™s established conferences by bringing together key HPC researchers, academics, technology specialists and industry leaders from across the region and beyond.  
 In addition, Conference on Next Generation Arithmetic (CoNGA), the leading conference on emerging technologies for computer arithmetic, will also be back once again and will be held in conjunction with SCA23. Gain the latest news and updates on the developments of breakthroughs with next generation data formats and their corresponding hardware, tools, applications and services and exchange ideas on what next generation arithmetic should be.
