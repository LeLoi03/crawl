 The International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO)  provides a premier venue to bring together researchers and practitioners working at the interface of hardware and software on a wide range of optimization and code generation techniques and related issues. The conference spans the spectrum from purely static to fully dynamic approaches, and from pure software-based methods to specific architectural features and support for code generation and optimization.  
 CGO will be held in conjunction with PPoPP  , CC  and HPCA  .
