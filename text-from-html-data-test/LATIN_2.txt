 This volume constitutes the proceedings of the Second International Symposium, Latin American Theoretical Informatics, LATIN '95, held in Valparaiso, Chile in April 1995.  
  The LATIN symposia are intended to be comprehensive events on the theory of computing; they provide a high-level forum for theoretical computer science research in Latin America and facilitate a strong and healthy interaction with the international community. The 38 papers presented in this volume were carefully selected from 68 submissions. Despite the intended broad coverage there are quite a number of papers devoted to computational graph theory; other topics strongly represented are complexity, automata theory, networks symbolic computation, formal languages, data structures, and pattern matching.

 This volume contains the proceedings of LATIN '92, a theoretical computer science symposium (Latin American Theoretical Informatics) held in São Paulo, Brazil in April 1992. LATIN is intended to be a comprehensive symposium in the theory of computing, but for this first meeting the following areas were chosen for preferential coverage: algorithms and data structures, automata and formal languages, computability and complexity theory, computational geometry, cryptography, parallel and distributed computation symbolic and algebraic computation, and combinatorial and algebraic aspects of computer science. The volume includes full versions of the invited papers by 11 distinguished guest lecturers as well as 32 contributed papers selected from 66 submissions from authors with affiliations in 26 countries.   
 Keywords  : Algorithms Data Structures, Automata and Formal Languages, Theory of Computation, Discrete Mathematics
