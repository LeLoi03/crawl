  Call For Papers   
   
 General information FSE 2025 will take place in Rome, Italy on March 17-21, 2025. FSE 2025 is organized by the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR). The scope of FSE concentrates on fast and secure primitives for symmetric cryptography, including the design and analysis of block ciphers, stream ciphers, encryption schemes, hash functions, message authentication codes, (cryptographic) permutations, authenticated encryption schemes, cryptanalysis and evaluation tools, and security issues and solutions regarding their implementation. Since 2017, FSE also solicits submissions for Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers. These papers aim at reviewing and contextualizing the existing literature in a particular area in order to systematize the existing knowledge in that area. To be considered for publication, they must provide an added value beyond prior work, such as novel insights or reasonably questioning previous assumptions. Stipends Students whose papers have been accepted and who present their talks at the conference will have their registration waived. A limited number of stipends are available to those unable to obtain funding to attend the conference. Students, whose papers are accepted and who will present the paper themselves, are encouraged to apply if such assistance is needed. Requests for stipends should be sent to the General Chairs. Publication Model From 2017, FSE has moved to an open-access journal/conference hybrid model. Submitted articles undergo a journal-style reviewing process. Accepted papers are published in Gold Open Access (free availability from day one) by the Ruhr University of Bochum in an issue of the newly established journal IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology (ToSC). The yearly FSE event will consist of presentations of the articles accepted to the journal IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology, as well as invited talks and social activities. This new model has been established as a way to improve reviewing and publication quality while retaining the highly successful community event FSE. For any further information, please view the ToSC FAQ page. For FSE 2025, authors can submit papers to the IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology four times, every three months on a predictable schedule. Authors are notified of the decisions about two months after submission. In addition to accept and reject decisions, papers may be provided with "minor revision" decisions, in which case the paper is conditionally accepted and an assigned shepherd will verify if the changes are applied, or "major revision" decisions, in which case authors are invited to revise and resubmit their article to one of the following two submission deadlines, otherwise the paper will be treated as a new submission. We endeavor to assign the same reviewers to revised versions. Papers accepted for publication before the end of January 2025 will be presented at that year's conference. Note that it is mandatory that accepted papers at the IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology journal are presented at the corresponding FSE event.  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2024-09-16
