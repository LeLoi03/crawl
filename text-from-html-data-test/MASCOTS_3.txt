 32nd International Symposium on the Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer  
  and Telecommunication Systems   
  
 The MASCOTS conference is a well-established forum for state-of-the-art research on the measurement, modeling, and performance analysis of computer systems and networks. The 32nd edition of this conference will take place on October 21-23, 2024  in the Radisson Blu Hotel, Krakow, Poland. The conference will bring together academia and industry to present and discuss their latest research results. The technical program for the 3-day conference will include keynote talks and refereed paper presentations, including workshops.  
 We encourage original submissions describing state-of-the-art research in the areas of the performance evaluation of computer systems and networks as well as in related areas. Papers describing results of theoretical and/or practical significance are welcome. Experimental, modeling, and simulation studies are all in the scope of the conference. Papers focusing on novel performance evaluation methods or providing insights on design and runtime management tradeoffs are particularly encouraged.  
 The deadline for paper submissions was Sunday, May 19  , Sunday, June 9th 2024 (extended)  .  
 Accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore, subject to meeting IEEE Xplore’s scope and quality requirements.  
 The Organizing Committee of MASCOTS’24 announces that a selection of accepted papers will be invited to submit an extended version to the prestigious Performance Evaluation (PEVA) journal.  
 Some of the best submitted papers that fall below the acceptance threshold for the main conference program, will be invited to the MASCOTS’24 Workshop. If they are orally live presented at the workshop by one registered author, they will then be published in the MASCOTS’24 proceedings as 4-page short papers.  
 The MASCOTS 2023 and 2022 proceedings are available at IEEE Xplore  
 All questions about the conference should be emailed to mascots2024 at easychair dot org
