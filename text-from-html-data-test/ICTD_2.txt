  About  
 The International Conference on Information & Communication Technologies and Development (ICTD)  is a research conference that explores the role of information and communication technologies (ICT) in global development. The conference reflects the multidisciplinary and multisectoral nature of ICTD work, with representation from a broad range of areas (anthropology, communication, computer science, design, economics, electrical engineering, geography, global health, information science, political science, sociology, and many others), as well as participation from academia, industry, civil society, and government.  
 The first ICTD was held at the University of California, Berkeley, USA in 2006. So far, there have been 11 conferences, held every 18 months. Explore previous yearâ€™s events and proceedings  to learn more.
