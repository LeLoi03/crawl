 Description   
 The Covid-19 Pandemic and climate change repropose the issues of the relation between the built environment (BE) and quality of life, subjective well-being (SWB), Liveability and Health. In response to these new urban concerns, urban policies have focused on reorganising cities to improve strategies for achieving resilience, sustainability, inclusion and individuals’ quality of life. The C40 cities initiative, that include 100 major cities in several Countries, underlines the need for actions of urban regeneration as a central condition for a sustainable and just recovery. Strategies adopted in several cities, including Milan, Paris, Bogotà, Portland, Melbourne focus on a re-configuration of the built environment aimed at implementing smart and sustainable mobility solutions, expanding the ecological infrastructure, increasing the provision of basic services at the district scale, and transforming public and open spaces for multi-functional uses (C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, 2020; Miller, 2021). The emerging urban concepts proposed for the post-pandemic scenario converge on the idea of an adaptive transformation of the urban environment based on criteria of density, diversity, safety, proximity and digitalisation. These aspects can be summarised in the idea of the smart and healthy city. The latter can be defined as an urban concept that prefigures the integration of the dimensions of proximity and diversity of primary and secondary uses, localization and distribution of local services, density, digitalisation and usability of public and open spaces, as central aspects for constructing a city, for the post-pandemic scenario, that ensures quality of life, well-being, sustainability, and social inclusion.  
 Thus, the proposed workshop aims to investigate (but is not limited) the issue of the relation between built environment components and SWB, as a key aspect for the construction of smarter, safer, and healthier cities for the post-pandemic scenario.  
 The workshop will host contributions focusing on the theoretical and methodological approaches related to the construction of a smart, safe and healthy city for the post-pandemic scenario. More precisely, the pertinent topics will include: i) the conceptualisation of the post-pandemic city within the perspective of the smarter, safer, and healthier city; ii) the influence of physical components of the urban built environment on quality of life; iii) the role of public and open spaces to promote a liveable and sustainable urban environment; iv) the influence of urban characteristics on the perception of the built environment from the different categories of citizens; v) the analytic methods, tools and techniques to support urban decision process oriented to smart, safe and healthy cities; vi) strategies of urban planning within a perspective of sustainability, inclusion and cohesion.  
 Given the focus of the Conference on Computational Science issues, the workshop welcomes contributions on ICT and computational aspects, proposals, and applications from a wide variety of scholars on the above-mentioned issues.  
 Engineers, Geologists, Urban and Regional Planners, Landscape Architects, Geographers and Economic Geographers, Environmental Engineers, among others are welcome to contribute.  
 Keywords  : Climate Change, Smart and Sustainable Cities, Smart governance, Urban Resilience, Participatory Mapping, Citizen Science, Open Data, Big Data, Sustainability, Urban and Regional Planning, Pollution in riverine and marine environments, Effects that climate change has on the waste management infrastructure, Challenges, and opportunities for innovation cities  
   
 Each paper will be independently reviewed by 3 programme committee members. Their individual scores will be evaluated by a small sub-committee and result in one of the following final decisions: accepted, or accepted on the condition that suggestions for improvement will be incorporated, or rejected. Notification of this decision will take place on May 2023.  
  Individuals and groups should submit complete papers (12 to 18 pages).  
  Accepted contributions will be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) volumes
