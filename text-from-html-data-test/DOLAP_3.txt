 First Published in InfoDB Daman Consulting Designing a Data Warehouse A Hybrid of Concepts, Techniques and Methods  bill will    
 In my white paper Planning For A Data Warehouse, I covered the essential issues of the data warehouse planning process. 1 This time I move on to take a detailed look at the topic of warehouse design. In this discussion I focus on design issues often overlooked in implementing several of the warehouse services outlined in my previous article: • Acquisition – bringing data into the warehouse from the operational environment • Preparation – packaging the data for a variety of uses by a diverse set of information consumers • Navigation – assisting consumers in finding and using warehouse resources • Access – supporting direct interaction with data warehouse data by consumers using a variety of tools • Delivery – providing agent-driven collections and subscription information delivery to consumers Creating the Data Warehouse Data Model Moral: A good data warehouse model is a synthesis of diverse non-traditional factors. A data warehouse model must be comprehensive, current and dynamic, and provide a complete picture of the physical reality of the warehouse as it evolves. The data warehouse database schema should be generated and maintained directly from the model. The model not just a design aid, but an ongoing communication and management tool. Managing the dynamic nature of a data warehouse is one of the most daunting challenges. New feeds must be supported from new and existing sources. New configurations of data must be packaged with tools to meet continually changing needs. Under-utilized datasets must be retired or consolidated with others. Staying on top of these changes is easier when the model is religiously used to maintain the database structure. A good data warehouse model is a hybrid representing the diversity of different data containers 1 required to acquire, store, package, and deliver sharable data. To be useful, a warehouse data model must contain physical representations, such as summaries and derived data. The basic entities and attributes that will become core atomic tables are just the starting point for a data warehouse. A purely logical model contains none of the substance that defines the primary warehouse deliverables. These deliverables are the many aggregates, packages or collections of data produced to satisfy consumer access needs. The model must also include archive data and metadata as well as core data and collections. An archive is a managed, historical extension of the on-line warehouse tables (see " Operations: Implementing a True Archive " below). You must include the definition of the archive tables in the model to record the full context of available data. Metadata is best modeled side-by-side with the data itself and stored co-resident with the warehouse tables.

 Data warehousing-Implementation, Architecture and Future needs  IJERT Journal    
 International Journal of Engineering Research and Technology (IJERT), 2012  
 https://www.ijert.org/data-warehousing-implementation-architecture-and-future-needs https://www.ijert.org/research/data-warehousing-implementation-architecture-and-future-needs-IJERTV1IS8428.pdf Data warehouses was coined by bill inmon in early 1990,since then data warehouses have been at the forefront of information technology as a way for organisation for effectively use of digital information. A data warehouse is a database use for data analysis and reporting.it is a central repository of data which is created by integrating data from multiple source system. A data ware house stores current and also historical data and can be used for making report for senior management. Data in data ware house are uploaded from uploaded from operational system. The data may pass through an operational data store for some additional operations before they are used in data warehouse for reporting

 Data Warehousing: from Occasional OLAP to Real-time Business Intelligence (Dagstuhl Seminar 11361)  Gottfried Vossen    
 Dagstuhl Reports, 2011  
 This report documents the outcomes of the Dagstuhl Seminar 11361 &quot;Data Warehousing: from Occasional OLAP to Real-time Business Intelligence&quot;. In the past, data warehousing and analytical processing (OLAP) have produced fundamental and important technologies for the design, management, and use of information systems for decision support. Indeed, many industrial and administrative organizations have successfully used data warehouses to collect essential indicators that help them improve their business processes and their decision making efforts. Recent developments like column stores instead of row stores at the physical level, real-time data warehousing and Business Intelligence applications at the conceptual level, and decision support for new emerging applications have raised new research questions. This seminar has focused on the following five main topics: (i) Real-Time Data Warehouses and Business Intelligence, (ii) Spatio-Temporal Data Warehousing, (iii) Situational B...
