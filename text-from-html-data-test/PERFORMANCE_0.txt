 CONFERENCE REGISTRATION IS OPEN   (The conference will be held at Wieboldt Hall  in Northwestern University's downtown campus)   
     
 The 41st International Symposium on Computer Performance, Modeling, Measurements and Evaluation 2023 will be held in Evanston/Chicago, USA. The IFIP Performance conference aims to bring together researchers interested in understanding and improving the performance of communication systems by means of state-of-the-art quantitative models and solution techniques. The Performance conference has a long-standing tradition and has followed an 18-month cycle for many years, recently changed to a one year cycle.  
 Main conference   
 The IFIP PERFORMANCE 2023 conference solicits research papers on the design of algorithms, mathematical modeling, simulation and measurement techniques for computer systems or communication networks. We specifically also invite papers reproducing prior results in these areas, when adding to the reproducibility or applicability of the result.   
 Specific topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following.  
 Performance-oriented methodologies including:   
 Analytical modelling techniques and model validation 
  Anomaly detection, problem diagnosis and troubleshooting 
  Capacity planning, resource allocation, routing, scheduling and quality of service 
  Experimental design, statistical analysis, simulation 
  Game theory, network economics, and platform design 
  Machine learning, data mining, graph analysis, optimization 
  Performance, scalability, power and reliability analysis 
  Stochastic modelling, statistical analysis and simulation 
  Sustainability analysis and power management 
  Complex networks, sorting and ranking 
  System measurement, performance monitoring and forecasting 
  Workload characterization and benchmarking 
  Evaluation techniques, and algorithms for:   
 Artificial intelligence and machine learning platforms 
  Blockchains and crypto-currency 
  Computer architectures and operating systems 
  Cyber-physical systems, internet of things, and smart grids 
  Data centres, content delivery, cloud computing and virtualization 
  High performance computing 
  Internet and web services 
  Mobile and personal computing systems 
  Network architectures, protocols and congestion control 
  Network economics and platform design 
  Privacy and algorithmic fairness 
  Security systems 
  Storage systems and data centres 
  Social networks, multimedia systems and smart grid 
  Virtualization, data centres, distributed and cloud computing, fog and edge computing 
  Quantum computing and quantum communication 
  Wireless, ad-hoc and cellular networks
