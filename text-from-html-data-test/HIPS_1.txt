 ABOUT IPDPS WORKSHOPS   
 Usually held on the first and last day of the conference, IPDPS workshops provide an extended forum that allows the IPDPS community an opportunity to fully explore special topics and to present work that is more preliminary and cutting-edge or that has more practical content than the more mature research presented in the main symposium. Each workshop has its own requirements and schedule for submissions. Workshop paper submission dates typically fall after the notification date for the main symposium papers. Proceedings of the workshops are distributed at the conference and are submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library after the conference.  
 Below is the list of 21 workshops planned for 2023 in St. Petersburg, Florida. For the most up to date information on each workshop, follow the link from this page.

 ABOUT IPDPS WORKSHOPS   
 Usually held on the first and last day of the conference, IPDPS workshops provide an extended forum that allows the IPDPS community an opportunity to fully explore special topics and to present work that is more preliminary and cutting-edge or that has more practical content than the more mature research presented in the main symposium. Each workshop has its own requirements and schedule for submissions. Workshop paper submission dates typically fall after the notification date for the main symposium papers. Proceedings of the workshops are distributed at the conference and are submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library after the conference.  
 Below is the list of 21 workshops planned for 2023 in St. Petersburg, Florida. For the most up to date information on each workshop, follow the link from this page.
