  2023-09-21 The proceedings are now available.    
 2023-07-10: Conference Preliminary Program is published   
 2023-04-24: A new conference poster is available   
 2023-04-01: We would like to inform you that we have decided to open the second round of submissions for the 15th Asian Conference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems (ACIIDS 2023), with a new deadline of April 16, 2023.  
  This decision is due to the fact that the interval between ACIIDS 2022 (Nov. 2022) and ACIIDS 2023 (July 2023) is much shorter than a year, and we have received many requests from authors to give them more time to prepare their works.  
  The review process for papers that have already been submitted will proceed as scheduled, and the submission deadline extension will not affect the review process. However, the acceptance decisions for both rounds of submissions will be announced at the same time, on May 30, 2023  .   
 2023-03-15: Deadline for Paper submission has been extended to March 31, 2023    
 2023-03-01: Deadline for Paper submission has been extended to March 14, 2023
