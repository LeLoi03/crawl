  Since 1990, the International Workshop on Network and Operating Systems Support for Digital Audio and Video (NOSSDAV) has been serving as an outstanding forum for researchers and developers involved in building innovative multimedia systems, networks, and applications. NOSSDAV is strategically positioned at the boundaries of applications and the operating systems/network, bridging the gap between highly demanding applications and the infrastructure. The 33rd NOSSDAV will continue to focus on both established and emerging research topics, high-risk, high-return ideas and proposals, and future research directions in multimedia networking and systems, in a single-track format that encourages active participation and discussions among academic and industry researchers and practitioners. Out-of-the-box ideas are particularly welcome; NOSSDAV prefers exciting-even-if-incomplete papers over complete-but-boring papers.  
 The workshop seeks papers in all areas of multimedia systems with an emphasis on the systems and networking aspects. Authors are especially encouraged to submit papers with real-world experimental results and datasets. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):  
 Networking and Systems Support for Multimedia | Multimedia Computing 
  Multimedia Coding and Processing 
  Multimedia Storage 
  Multimedia System Architectures 
  Network-distributed Multimedia Processing 
  Networked GPUs/TPUs, Graphics and Virtual Environments 
  Wireless, Mobile, IoT and Embedded Systems for Multimedia 
  Cloud, Edge, and Fog Architectures for Multimedia 
  Blockchain Support for Multimedia 
  Security and Privacy in Multimedia Systems 
  Multimedia Applications: Systems, QoS/QoE and Human Factors | Multimedia Streaming Applications 
  Audio/Image/Video Analytics Systems 
  Medical Multimedia Systems 
  Surveillance Multimedia Systems 
  Autonomous Driving Multimedia Systems 
  Interactive Multimedia Systems and Networked/Online Games 
  Immersive Multimedia Systems: Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality 
  Metaverse, Web3 Multimedia, NFT 

 Submission Process  
  Prospective authors are invited to submit an electronic version of full papers, in PDF format, up to six (6) printed pages plus one (1) page solely for references in length (double column ACM style format  ) at the workshop website. Authors must prepare their papers in a way that preserves the anonymity of the authors.  Please do NOT include the author names under the title. The workshop proceedings will be published by ACM Digital Library.  
 Submission deadline: 10th March, 2023 
  Acceptance notification: 31st March, 2023 
  Camera-ready deadline: 17th April, 2023

 Program  
  Keynote   
 Title: Networked Immersive Media: For Human and For Machine 
  Speaker: Prof. Jiangchuan Liu (Simon Fraser University) 
  Abstract: Cyberspace has long had an ambitious goal --- connecting the world, understanding the world, and interacting with the world, both physically and virtually, for human beings and machines, anytime and anywhere. This remained a dream a decade ago. With the unprecedented development in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector in the past decade, however, it is now solid and reachable to a great extent, if not all. In this talk, we will discuss our recent works on immersive media over the Internet and advanced mobile networks, from synergized neuro and traditional compression, to personalized distribution, and to multi-modal interaction. Besides human beings as consumers, we will further explore the new world when machines act as consumers, with a focus on mobile video analytics. We will also examine their applications in extreme environments as well as the opportunities and challenges from the latest advances in communication and computing infrastructures, including streaming over low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, batteryless spatial acoustic sensing, and cross-region analytics.
