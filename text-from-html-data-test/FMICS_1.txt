   1.  ERCIM's oldest active Working Group   
 Following an initial successful workshop bringing together ERCIM members interested in formal verification, held in Pisa in December 1992 Stefania Gnesi and Diego Latella, CNR, Pisa proposed to create an ERCIM working group dedicated to Formal Methods for Industrial Critical Systems (FMICS). Although at that time model checking was in its early days, the early ERCIM FMICS community was already aware of the great potential of formal verification techniques.  
 Since then, the WG, chaired in succession by Diego Latella (ISTI-CNR), Hubert Garavel (INRIA), Stefania Gnesi (ISTI), Pedro Merino (SparCIM), Alessandro Fantechi (ISTI), Radu Mateescu (INRIA), and Tiziana Margaria (LERO), has kept pace with the development of formal verification techniques - and model checking in particular. The series of annual workshops, began in 1996 and sponsored by the WG, have promoted an ongoing scientific discussion focussed on identifying the most efficient verification techniques, with a keen eye to their industrial applicability. Most of the members of the FMICS community have strong links with industry and have thus contributed to the slow but constant introduction of formal methods in the development cycle of industrial critical systems witnessed in the last decade. The WG has also addressed other readily applicable verification techniques, such as static analysis by abstract interpretation. Similarly, the whole formal development lifecycle has been addressed, for example in the 2008 FMICS workshop where considerable attention was paid to the recent diffusion of Model Driven Development in industry.  
 In 2008, issue number 75 of the ERCIM News  hosted a joint special session edited by Pedro Merino, coordinator of the WG, and Erwin Schoitsch, coordinator of the DES Dependable Embedded System WG, featuring almost 30 articles many of which reporting advances on the application of formal methods in industry.  
 The FMICS workshop series has always been open to contributions from outside the ERCIM community and strong links have been maintained with other organizations, such as Formal Methods Europe. In November 2009, the FMICS workshop was held during the FM week, a special gathering of events organized this year by the FME association.  
  2.  Background   
 Formal methods have been advocated as a means of increasing the reliability of systems, especially those which are safety or business critical, but the industrial uptake of such methods has been slow. This is due to the perceived difficulty of mathematical nature of these methods, the lack of tool support, and the lack of precedents where formal methods has been proven to be effective. It is even more difficult to develop automatic specification and verification tools due to limitations like state explosion, undecidability, etc. This working group will bring together researchers of the ERCIM consortium in order to promote the use of formal methods within industry.  
 The behaviour of reactive systems is largely conditioned by the interaction with events of the external environment the sequentialization of which is not predictable. The complexity of the systems' behaviour increases considerably when the timing dependencies in the execution of events are taken into account.  
 The above features are typical of a large class of systems including control systems, automation systems, and communication systems and results in the extreme difficulty of the verification of their correctness.  
 In the industrial context correctness verification is usually performed by means of testing; the system is provided with input sequences drawn from a proper "coverage set" and its resulting behaviour is observed.  
 Due to the multiplicity of possibilities both for inputs to a system and originating from more and more use of parallelism and concurrency this approach turns out to be very costly and in any case it does not allow for the exhaustive verification of the correctness of the system. It allows only to detect errors which take place during the execution sequences used for the test.  
 In the last decade several theories have been developed which aim at coping with the problem of systems correctness by means of formal methodologies for the specification, design and verification of systems. These theories have been extended in order to deal with time, probability and stochastic aspects of behaviours.  
 Also real-time models where time is a dense quantity and verification can be done algorithmically (automatically) has been developed.  
 More recently, international standards for safety recommend the use of such methodologies, especially for critical systems.  
 Nevertheless, the use of formal methods in the industry is still quite limited. Apparently, major reasons for that are the notational difficulty of most formal methods available nowdays and the lack of integration between them. Notational complexity is often a deterrent to the use of formal methods stronger than the advantages of such methods. This is reinforced by the lack of models which support all the activities of system development:  
 requirements specification 
  validation of the specification 
  design 
  verification of the final product against the requirements 
  For each of the above activities different techniques have been developed independently. They are usually not at all integrated neither compatible and quite often they have been tried only on toy-examples, bringing to results which are rather difficult to compare. Finally, most of the automatic tools developed for supporting the use of formal methods lack of industrial strength and so turn out to be unpractical when used in the industrial context.  
  3.  Objectives   
 The main objectives of the WG are: To bring together scientists mainly of, but not only of institutions within ERCIM who are active in the field of formal methods and are willing to exchange their experience in the industrial usage of formal methods. 
  To coordinate efforts in the transfer of the formal methods technology and knowledge to the industry. 
  To promote research and development for the improvement of formal methods and tools with respect to their usage in the industry. 
  The above objectives will be met by means of: Workshops where the participation of industrial professionals will be solicited. 
  Development projects with industrial partners. 
  Research projects and researchers mobility.
