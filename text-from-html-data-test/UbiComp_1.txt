 UbiComp 2013  
 The 2013 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing  (UbiComp 2013) is the result of a merger of the two most renown conferences in the field: Pervasive  and UbiComp  . While it retains the name of the latter in recognition of the visionary work of Mark Weiser, its long name reflects the dual history of the new event.  
   The conference was held in this new merged format for the very first time from September 8-12, 2013  , in Zurich, Switzerland.  
 The UbiComp 2013 Proceedings  are available via the ACM Digital Library (ISBN 978-1-4503-1770-2).  
 By offering a single venue for the leading worldwide research in Pervasive and Ubiquitous computing, the new format is meant to better serve the needs of the research community by attracting more attendees (including the leading Pervasive/UbiComp researchers worldwide), and enabling more satellite events. UbiComp 2013 was multi-track and featured a program  of 92 scientific paper presentations (acceptance rate 23.4%)  . Topics included any work that one would previously expect to find at either UbiComp or Pervasive.  
 Following several successful collaborations as part of the Pervasive conference series, UbiComp 2013 continued the tradition of collocating with ISWC 2013  .  
 The adjunct program  is available at www.ubicomp.org/ubicomp2013/adjunct/starthere.htm  . You can alternatively download all adjunct papers in a single 1.24GB ZIP-file: UbiComp2013_adjunct.zip
