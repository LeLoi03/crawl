   (apologies for cross-posting) LPAR 2023: The 24th International Conference on Logic for Programming Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning Universidad Nacional de Colombia Manizales, Colombia, June 4-9, 2023 Submission link https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lpar2023  Conference program https://easychair.org/smart-program/LPAR2023/  Abstract deadline March 6, 2023 Submission deadline March 13, 2023 The series of International Conferences on Logic for Programming, Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning (LPAR) is a forum where, year after year, some of the most renowned researchers in the areas of logic, automated reasoning computational logic, programming languages and their applications come to present cutting-edge results, to discuss advances in these fields, and to exchange ideas. LPAR is an "A" ranked conference in the CORE ranking system; papers from previous proceedings are listed in DBLP. LPAR-24 will be held in Manizales, Colombia, at the National University of Colombia, 4-9th June 2023. See the conference web site for all the details. The proceedings of LPAR-24 will be published by EasyChair, in the EPiC Series in Computing. *** Submission Guidelines All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. The following paper categories are welcome: + Regular papers describing solid new research results. They can be up to 15 pages long in EasyChair style, including figures but excluding references and appendices (that reviewers are not required to read). Where applicable regular papers are supported by experimental validation. + Experimental and tool papers describing implementations of systems, report experiments with implemented systems, or compare implemented systems. Experimental and tool papers should be supported by a link to the artifact/ experimental evaluation available to the reviewers. The length of regular papers is limited to 15 pages in the EasyChair style (excluding the blibliography and appendices). The length of experimental and tool papers is limited to 8 pages in the EasyChair style (excluding the bibliography and appendices). Both types of papers must be electronically submitted in PDF via EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lpar2023  Authors of accepted papers are required to ensure that at least one of them will be present at the conference. *** List of Topics New results in the fields of computational logic and applications are welcome. Also welcome are more exploratory presentations, which may examine open questions and raise fundamental concerns about existing theories and practices. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: Abduction Answer set programming Automated reasoning Constraint programming Computational proof theory Decision procedures Description logics Foundations of security Hardware verification Implementations of logic Interpolation Interactive theorem proving Knowledge representation and reasoning Logic and computational complexity Logic and databases Logic and games Logic and machine learning Logic and the web Logic and types Logic in artificial intelligence Logic programming Logical foundations of programming Logics of knowledge and belief Modal and temporal logics Model checking Non-monotonic reasoning Ontologies and large knowledge bases Probabilistic and fuzzy reasoning Program analysis Rewriting Satisfiability checking Satisfiability modulo theories Software verification Unification theory ***Program Committee Chairs Ruzica Piskac Yale University Andrei Voronkov The University of Manchester -------------- next part -------------- An HTML attachment was scrubbed...
