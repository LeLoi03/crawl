 MCU 2022 - 9th Conference on Machines, Computations and Universality  
   
  August 31 - September 2, 2022, Debrecen, Hungary    
 Important Dates    
 Submission deadline:  April 24  , May 8, 2022, 
  Notification of acceptance:  May 23  , May 30, 2022, 
  Final version:  June 5  , June 10, 2022. 

  General Information     
 The International conference series MCU  traces its roots back to the mid 1990's  , and has always been concerned with gaining a deeper understanding of computation and universality  through the study of models of general purpose computation.    
 The 9th edition of MCU  is organized by the Faculty of Informatics of the University of Debrecen, it is co-located with NCMA 2022  , the 12th International Workshop on Non-Classical Models of Automata and Applications (August 26-27, 2022) and DCFS 2022  , the 24th Conference on Descriptional Complexity of Formal Systems (August 29-31, 2022).   
 The conference will take place in a hybrid format  : the possibility of both, in-person  and online participation  will be provided.   
  Proceedings     
 The MCU conference series  with the LNCS volumes on SpringerLink  : https://link.springer.com/conference/mcu    
   
 The volume containing the proceedings of MCU 2022  is available online  at: https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-13502-6    

  Special Issue     
 A selection of papers  will be invited to submit extended versions for publication in a special issue  of the International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science   .

  The updated call for papers  in single page format for printing  is available. 
   Aims and Scope     
 The scope of the conference  topics includes  , but is not limited to, computation in the setting of various discrete models  (Turing machines, register machines, cellular automata, tile assembly systems, rewriting systems, molecular computing models, neural models...), analog and hybrid models  (BSS machines, infinite time cellular automata, real machines, quantum computing...) and the meaning and implantation of universality  in these contexts. Particular emphasis is given towards search for frontiers between decidability and undecidability  in the various models, search for the simplest universal models  , computational complexity of predicting the evolution  of computations in the various models. Parallel computing  models and their connections to decidability, complexity and universality  .   
 Topics of interest include, but not exclusively:     
 Analog computation 
  Automata theory 
  Cellular automata 
  Classical computability and degree structures 
  Computability theoretic aspects of programs 
  Computable analysis and real computation

   Author Guidelines     
 Submitted papers must describe work not previously published  , and they must neither be accepted nor under review at a journal or at another conference with refereed proceedings. Authors are required to submit their manuscripts electronically  in PDF using the LNCS style.   
 A best paper  and a best student paper  will be selected by the program committee and announced during the conference. To be eligible for best student paper, except for at most one PhD adviser co-author, all co-authors  and the person presenting the paper should at most have presented their PhD after September 1, 2021  .
