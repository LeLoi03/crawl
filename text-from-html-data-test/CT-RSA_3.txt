 Overview  
 Top Research Topics at The Cryptographers’ Track at the RSA Conference?  
 Computer security (32.09%) 
  Cryptography (30.48%) 
  Theoretical computer science (30.12%) 
  The objective of the conference is to combine knowledge in the areas of Computer security, Cryptography, Theoretical computer science, Encryption and Algorithm. The Computer security study tackled is a key component of adjacent topics in the area of Protocol (object-oriented programming). It holds forums on Cryptography that merges themes from other disciplines such as Discrete mathematics, Digital signature and Public-key cryptography.  
 Research on Public-key cryptography addressed in it frequently intersections with the field of Cryptosystem. While work presented in it provided substantial information on Theoretical computer science, it also covered topics in Signature (logic), Mathematical proof, Random oracle, Hash function and Scheme (programming language). The event focuses on different Encryption studies like Probabilistic encryption, Ciphertext, Attribute-based encryption, 40-bit encryption and Plaintext.  
 The main emphasis of the conference is the subject of Probabilistic encryption, focusing on Deterministic encryption. Ciphertext indistinguishability is part of Ciphertext studies tackled in it. The work on Block cipher addressed in it expands to the thematically related Cipher.  
 What are the most cited papers published at the conference?  
 Cache attacks and countermeasures: the case of AES (966 citations) 
  Better key sizes (and attacks) for LWE-based encryption (491 citations) 
  Foundations of group signatures: the case of dynamic groups (455 citations) 
  Research areas of the most cited articles at The Cryptographers’ Track at the RSA Conference:  
 The conference articles mainly deal with areas of study such as Cryptography, Theoretical computer science, Computer security, Encryption and Public-key cryptography. The most cited articles explore research in Parallel computing and overlapping concepts in Modular exponentiation to expand the discourse in Cryptography. While Encryption is the key highlight in the most cited papers, thet also covered some subjects on Embedded system and Advanced Encryption Standard.  
 What topics the last edition of the conference is best known for?  
 Operating system 
  Cryptography 
  Programming language 
  The previous edition focused in particular on these issues:  
 The Cryptographers’ Track at the RSA Conference facilitates discussions on Cryptography, Discrete mathematics, Theoretical computer science, Computer security and Cryptanalysis. The presentations focused mostly on Cryptography in an attempt to further explore topics in Algorithm. In the event, Representation (mathematics), Key exchange, EdDSA, Scheme (programming language) and Function (mathematics) are investigated in conjunction with one another to address concerns in Theoretical computer science research.  
 The presented Computer security study covers related areas such as Computer security model, Anonymity and Blockchain and also touches on topics like First generation. The Cryptographers’ Track at the RSA Conference is concerned with the study of Cryptanalysis and Encryption in general. Public-key cryptography research are fields of study within Encryption but they also intertwine with concepts in Random function.  
 The most cited articles from the last conference are:  
 Inverse-Sybil Attacks in Automated Contact Tracing (3 citations) 
  On the Effectiveness of Time Travel to Inject COVID-19 Alerts (2 citations) 
  Secure Fast Evaluation of Iterative Methods: With an Application to Secure PageRank (1 citations) 
  Papers citation over time  
 A key indicator for each conference is its effectiveness in reaching other researchers with the papers published at that venue.  
 The chart below presents the interquartile range (first quartile 25%, median 50% and third quartile 75%) of the number of citations of articles over time.

 Publication chance based on affiliation  
 The publication chance index shows the ratio of articles published by the best research institutions at the conference edition to all articles published within that conference. The best research institutions were selected based on the largest number of articles published during all editions of the conference.  
 The chart below presents the percentage ratio of articles from top institutions (based on their ranking of total papers).Top affiliations were grouped by their rank into the following tiers: top 1-10, top 11-20, top 21-50, and top 51+. Only articles with a recognized affiliation are considered.  

 Research.com  

 During the most recent 2021 edition, 10.71%  of publications had an unrecognized affiliation. Out of the publications with recognized affiliations, 32.00%  were posted by at least one author from the top 10 institutions publishing at the conference. Another 16.00%  included authors affiliated with research institutions from the top 11-20 affiliations. Institutions from the 21-50 range included 28.00%  of all publications and 24.00%  were from other institutions.  
 Returning Authors Index  
 A very common phenomenon observed among researchers publishing scientific articles is the intentional selection of conferences they have already attended in the past. In particular, it is worth analyzing the case when the authors participate in the same conference from year to year.  
 The Returning Authors Index presented below illustrates the ratio of authors who participated in both a given as well as the previous edition of the conference in relation to all participants in a given year.

 The experience to innovation index  
 Our experience to innovation index was created to show a cross-section of the experience level of authors publishing at a conference. The index includes the authors publishing at the last edition of a conference  , grouped by total number of publications throughout their academic career (P) and the total number of citations of these publications ever received (C).  
 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups:  
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25), 
  Competent - P < 10 or C < 100 (the number of publications less than 10 or the number of citations less than 100), 
  Experienced - P < 25 or C < 625 (the number of publications less than 25 or the number of citations less than 625), 
  Master - P < 50 or C < 2500 (the number of publications less than 50 or the number of citations less than 2500), 
  Star - P ≥ 50 and C ≥ 2500 (both the number of publications greater than 50 and the number of citations greater than 2500). 

 The chart below illustrates experience levels of first authors in cases of publications with multiple authors.
