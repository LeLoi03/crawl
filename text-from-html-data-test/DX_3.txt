 33rd International Workshop on Principles of Diagnosis – DX 2022 Workshop in Toulouse, France, September 14th – 16th, 2022  
 DX 2022  
 Diagnosis is a classical part of Artificial Intelligence research. The aim of the annual DX Workshop is to unite researchers and practitioners with diverse backgrounds in order to leverage research in diagnosis, that is, identifying the root causes for encountered malfunctions. Since 1989, the DX Workshop series has been offering a forum to present current research and experience reports, exchange and discuss emerging ideas, as well as debate current issues and envisioned future challenges. Relevant topics are related to fault diagnosis, monitoring, testing, debugging, reconfiguration, fault-adaptive control, fault recovery, and repair.  
 Workshop Location  
 The 33rd International Workshop on Principles of Diagnosis (DX-2022) will be held September 14-16, 2022, in Toulouse, France. Toulouse is in the French department of Haute-Garonne and of the larger region of Occitanie. The city is on the banks of the River Garonne, 150 kilometres (93 miles) from the Mediterranean Sea.
