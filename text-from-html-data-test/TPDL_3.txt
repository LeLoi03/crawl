  abstract = {We present CaMeLS, a proof of concept of a cooperative meta-learning service for recommender systems. CaMeLS leverages the computing power of recommender systems users by uploading their metadata and algorithm evaluation scores to a centralized environment. Through the resulting database, CaMeLS then offers meta-learning services for everyone. Additionally, users may access evaluations of common data sets immediately to know the best-performing algorithms for those data sets. The metadata table may also be used for other purposes, eg, to perform benchmarks. In the initial version discussed in this paper, CaMeLS implements automatic algorithm selection through meta-learning over two recommender systems libraries. Automatic algorithm selection saves users time and computing power and does not require expertise, as the best algorithm is automatically found over multiple libraries. The CaMeLS database contains 20 metadata sets by default. We show that the automatic algorithm selection service is already on par with the single best algorithm in this default scenario. CaMeLS only requires a few seconds to predict a suitable algorithm, rather than potentially hours or days if performed manually, depending on the data set. The code is publicly available on our GitHub https://camels. recommender-systems.com.},

We suspect that failing to account for randomness in this scenario may lead to misrepresenting the predictive accuracy of recommendation algorithms. To understand the community’s view of the importance of randomness, we conducted a paper study on 39 full papers published at the ACM RecSys 2022 conference. We found that the authors of 26 papers used some variation of a holdout split that requires a random seed. However, only five papers explicitly repeated experiments and averaged their results over different random seeds. This potentially problematic research practice motivated us to analyze the effect of data split random seeds on recommendation accuracy. Therefore, we train three common algorithms on nine public data sets with 20 data split random seeds, evaluate them on two ranking metrics with three different ranking cutoff values k, and compare the results. In the extreme case with k = 1, we show that depending on the data split random seed, the accuracy with traditional recommendation algorithms deviates by up to ∼6.3% from the mean accuracy achieved on the data set. Hence, we show that an algorithm may significantly over- or under-perform when maliciously or negligently selecting a random seed for splitting the data. To showcase a mitigation strategy and better research practice, we compare holdout to cross-validation and show that, again, for k = 1, the accuracy of algorithms evaluated with cross-validation deviates only up to ∼2.3% from the mean accuracy achieved on the data set. Furthermore, we found that the deviation becomes smaller the higher the value of k for both holdout and cross-validation.},

  abstract = {The evaluation of recommender system algorithms depends on randomness, e.g., during randomly splitting data into training and testing data. We suspect that failing to account for randomness in this scenario may lead to misrepresenting the predictive accuracy of recommendation algorithms. To understand the community’s view of the importance of randomness, we conducted a paper study on 39 full papers published at the ACM RecSys 2022 conference. We found that the authors of 26 papers used some variation of a holdout split that requires a random seed. However, only five papers explicitly repeated experiments and averaged their results over different random seeds. This potentially problematic research practice motivated us to analyze the effect of data split random seeds on recommendation accuracy. Therefore, we train three common algorithms on nine public data sets with 20 data split random seeds, evaluate them on two ranking metrics with three different ranking cutoff values k, and compare the results. In the extreme case with k = 1, we show that depending on the data split random seed, the accuracy with traditional recommendation algorithms deviates by up to ∼6.3% from the mean accuracy achieved on the data set. Hence, we show that an algorithm may significantly over- or under-perform when maliciously or negligently selecting a random seed for splitting the data. To showcase a mitigation strategy and better research practice, we compare holdout to cross-validation and show that, again, for k = 1, the accuracy of algorithms evaluated with cross-validation deviates only up to ∼2.3% from the mean accuracy achieved on the data set. Furthermore, we found that the deviation becomes smaller the higher the value of k for both holdout and cross-validation.},

  an evaluation and present the results in this paper. The evaluation  
  was conducted with real users of the recommender system Docear. The  
  effectiveness of CC-IDF and CC-Only was measured using click-through

  the same effectiveness as CC-Only (CTR of 6.15% vs. 6.23%). In other

  by search engines, recommender systems, and user modeling engines.  
  With regard to user modeling and recommender systems, we see two  
  shortcomings of TF-IDF. First, calculating IDF requires access to  
  the document corpus from which recommendations are made. Such access  
  is not always given in a user-modeling or recommender system. Second,  
  TF-IDF ignores information from a userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal document

  a term-weighting scheme that does not require access to the general  
  document corpus and that considers information from the usersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢  
  personal document collections. We evaluated the effectiveness of  
  TF-IDuF compared to TF-IDF and TF-Only and found that TF-IDF and  
  TF-IDuF perform similarly (click-through rates (CTR) of 5.09% vs.  
  5.14%), and both are around 25% more effective than TF-Only (CTR  
  of 4.06%) for recommending research papers. Consequently, we conclude  
  that TF-IDuF could be a promising term-weighting scheme, especially  
  when access to the document corpus for recommendations is not possible,

Additionally, users may access evaluations of common data sets immediately to know the best-performing algorithms for those data sets. The metadata table may also be used for other purposes, eg, to perform benchmarks. In the initial version discussed in this paper, CaMeLS implements automatic algorithm selection through meta-learning over two recommender systems libraries. Automatic algorithm selection saves users time and computing power and does not require expertise, as the best algorithm is automatically found over multiple libraries. The CaMeLS database contains 20 metadata sets by default. We show that the automatic algorithm selection service is already on par with the single best algorithm in this default scenario. CaMeLS only requires a few seconds to predict a suitable algorithm, rather than potentially hours or days if performed manually, depending on the data set.

Automatic algorithm selection saves users time and computing power and does not require expertise, as the best algorithm is automatically found over multiple libraries. The CaMeLS database contains 20 metadata sets by default. We show that the automatic algorithm selection service is already on par with the single best algorithm in this default scenario. CaMeLS only requires a few seconds to predict a suitable algorithm, rather than potentially hours or days if performed manually, depending on the data set.

For this example comparison, we built a benchmark using Assembled-OpenML and implemented ensemble techniques expecting predictions instead of base models as input. In our example comparison, we gathered the prediction data of 1523 base models for 31 datasets. Obtaining the prediction data for all base models using Assembled-OpenML took ∼1 hour in total.

This is why we propose the basis of Online Neural Architecture Search (ONAS) to deal with complex, evolving, data distributions. We formalise ONAS as a minimisation problem upon which both the weights and the architecture of the neural network needs to be optimised for the data up until a time $t_i$. To solve this problem, we adapt a DARTS optimisation process, associated with an early stopping scheme, by using the supernet optimised on previous data as a warm-up initial state. This allows the architecture of the neural network to evolve as the data distribution evolves while limiting the computational burden. This work aims at building the initial mathematical formalism of the problem as well as the development of a framework where NAS methods could be used to solve this problem. Finally, several possible next steps are presented to show the potential of this field of Online Neural Architecture Search.},

  With regard to user modeling and recommender systems, we see two

  personal document collections. We evaluated the effectiveness of  
  TF-IDuF compared to TF-IDF and TF-Only and found that TF-IDF and

  Datasets for Recommender Systems, Machine Learning and Information Extraction   
  CITREC Citations   
  The CITREC  dataset contains the data of two formerly separate collections for citation analysis and it provides the tools necessary for performing evaluations of similarity measures. The first collection is the PubMed Central Open Access Subset (PMC OAS)  , the second is the collection used for the Genomics Tracks at the  Text REtrieval Conferences (TREC)  ’06 and ’07 (overview paper for the TREC Gen collection). CITREC extends the PMC OAS and TREC Genomics collections by providing:  
 citation and reference information that includes the position of in-text citations for documents in both collections; 
  code and pre-computed scores for 35 citation-based and text-based similarity measures; 
  two gold standards based on | Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) | descriptors and the relevance feedback gathered for the TREC Genomics collection; 
  a web-based system (Literature Recommendation Evaluator – LRE) that allows evaluating similarity measures on their ability to identify documents that are relevant to user-defined information needs; 
  tools to statistically analyze and compare the scores that individual similarity measures yield. 
   RARD — Related Articles   
 RARD  — the Related-Article Recommendation Dataset — is based on the digital library Sowiport and the recommendation-as-a-service provider Mr. DLib  . The dataset contains information about 57.4 million recommendations that were displayed to the users of Sowiport. Information includes details on which recommendation approaches were used (e.g. content-based filtering, stereotype, most popular), what types of features were used in content-based filtering (simple terms vs. keyphrases), where the features were extracted from (title or abstract), and the time when recommendations were delivered and clicked. In addition, the dataset contains an implicit item-item rating matrix that was created based on the recommendation click logs. RARD enables researchers to train machine learning algorithms for research-paper recommendations, perform offline evaluations, and do research on data from Mr. DLib’s recommender system, without implementing a recommender system themselves. In the field of scientific recommender systems, our dataset is unique. To the best of our knowledge, there is no dataset with more (implicit) ratings available, and that many variations of recommendation algorithms. The dataset is published under the “Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC-BY)” license.  
  Docear RecSys   
 We released a dataset  based on the recommender system in our reference management software Docear  . The dataset contains the following sub-datasets.  
 Research Papers — The research papers dataset contains information about the research papers that Docear’s PDF Spider crawled and their citations. This includes information about 9.4 million documents, including 7.95 million citations and 1.8 million URLs to freely available academic PDFs on the Web. The dataset also provides citation positions, i.e. where in a document a citation occurs. This leads to 19.3 million entries in the dataset.  
 Mind-Maps / User libraries — The mind maps dataset contains information on 390,613 revisions of 52,202 mind-maps created by 12,038 users. The mind-maps themselves are not included in the dataset due to privacy reasons. Information includes the number of nodes, the documents that are linked, the id of the user who created the mind-map, and when mind-maps were created  
 Users — The user dataset contains information about 8,059 of 21,439 registered users, namely about those who activated recommendations and agreed to have their data analyzed and published. Among others, the dataset includes information about the users’ date of registration, gender and age (if provided during registration), usage intensity of Docear, when Docear was last started, when recommendations were last received, the number of created mind-maps, number of papers, how recommendations were labeled, the number of received recommendations, and click-through rates (CTR) on recommendations.  
 Recommendations — The recommendation dataset contains information on 308,146 recommendations that were delivered to 3,470 users between March 2013 and March 2014. This includes the date of creation and delivery, the time required to generate recommendations and corresponding user models, and information on the algorithm that generated the recommendations. Information on the algorithms is manyfold. We stored whether stop words were removed, which weighting scheme was applied, whether terms and/or citations were used for the user modelling process and 28 other variables that are described in more detail in the dataset’s readme file.  
 We are interested in many research areas and are always open to exploring new exciting areas including deep learning, precision medicine, bias in AI, explainability, and many more. Feel also free to visit our colleagues’ web pages relating to machine learning at the University of Siegen  .

The impact of search term frequencies in an article’s full text is weak. That means it makes no difference in an article’s ranking if the article contains the query terms only once or multiple times. It was further researched whether the name of an author or journal has an impact on the ranking and whether differences exist between the ranking algorithms of different search modes that Google Scholar offers.

  abstract = {In the domain of academic search engines and research-paper recommender  
  systems, CC-IDF is a common citation-weighting scheme that is used  
  to calculate semantic relatedness between documents. CC-IDF adopts  
  the principles of the popular term-weighting scheme TF-IDF and assumes  
  that if a rare academic citation is shared by two documents then  
  this occurrence should receive a higher weight than if the citation  
  is shared among a large number of documents. Although CC-IDF is in  
  common use, we found no empirical evaluation and comparison of CC-IDF  
  with plain citation weight (CC-Only). Therefore, we conducted such  
  an evaluation and present the results in this paper. The evaluation  
  was conducted with real users of the recommender system Docear. The  
  effectiveness of CC-IDF and CC-Only was measured using click-through  
  rate (CTR). For 238,681 delivered recommendations, CC-IDF had about  
  the same effectiveness as CC-Only (CTR of 6.15% vs. 6.23%). In other  
  words, CC-IDF was not more effective than CC-Only, which is a surprising  
  result. We provide a number of potential reasons and suggest to conduct  
  further research to understand the principles of CC-IDF in more detail.},

Dass künftig die Rettungsdienste noch schneller zur Stelle sind, ermöglicht ein neues Notrufsystem, entwickelt von Jöran Beel, Lars Petersen sowie Béla Gipp und mittlerweile zum Patent angemeldet. Über ein normales Handy, das nach dem GSM-Standard arbeitet, teilt es die Position des Unfallfahrzeugs automatisch auf etwa 100 Meter genau mit. Dazu muss nur ein Beschleunigungssensor eingebaut und mit der Elektronik gekoppelt werden. Auch medizinische Daten wie die Blutgruppe lassen sich über die eingebaute SIM-Karte und die Zahl der Autoinsassen über die Gurtschlösser übermitteln.
