 The biennial International Conference On Knowledge Capture (K-CAP)  , formerly the Knowledge Acquisition Workshop (KAW) series 1)  , is providing a forum that brings together members of disparate research communities that are interested in efficiently capturing knowledge from a variety of sources and in creating representations that can be useful for reasoning, analysis, and other forms of machine processing.  
 K-CAP is held on odd yeary, alternately with EKAW  – the International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management.  
 The conference is sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery, Special Interest Group on Artificial (ACM SIGAI) among others.
