 EUROVA – DESCRIPTION   
 EuroVA 2017 is the eighth international EuroVis workshop on Visual Analytics.  
  It will take place June 12-13, 2017 in Barcelona, Spain.  
 Visual Analytics is a problem-solving and sense-making technology that integrates analytical computations, visual representations, and interaction. It includes the analysis of complex (massive, dynamic, ambiguous, conflicting, …) data and information for gaining understanding, building knowledge, and inferring insight. Visual Analytics aims at a synergistic collaboration of humans and computers mediated through interactive visual interfaces. As such, Visual Analytics is an interdisciplinary field of research, including aspects of visualization, human-computer interaction, statistics and mathematics, data management and knowledge representation, data analysis and machine learning, cognitive and perceptual sciences, and more.EuroVA 2017 is the best place to present and discuss ideas of new methods and theories, interesting applications, designs, and studies of the use of Visual Analytics methods and systems. The workshop will accept a range of paper types, including technique, system, application, evaluation and theory papers in the area of Visual Analytics.  
 CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS   
 EuroVA is an established workshop to present and discuss new ideas, methods and theories, interesting applications and designs, and studies of the use of Visual Analytics in practice.  
 The workshop will accept three paper types:  
 Research papers | present new unpublished concepts, methods, or techniques 
  Special session papers | focus on a topic of particular topic of interest 
  Position papers | express relevant and potentially controversial standpoints 
  The workshop seeks to attract innovative, fresh ideas, not necessarily highly polished, but with high potential of becoming significant contributions to the Visual Analytics community.  
 Special Session on Interaction   
 Visual Analytics integrates the human in the loop. Interaction between the human and Visual Analytics methods and tools is essential for effective data exploration and analysis. EuroVA 2017 especially invites papers that focus on interaction in Visual Analytics. Topics of interest for the special session on interaction include but are not limited to:  
 Interaction techniques for Visual Analytics 
  Interface design for exploration and analysis 
  New display environments and interaction modalities 
  Guidance for Visual Analytics 
  Syntax and semantics of interactions for data analysis activities 
  Models of human-in-the-loop data analysis 
  Collaborative Visual Analytics 
  Regular Topics   
 Regular topics of interest include but are not limited to:  
 Visual representations of complex data 
  Computational methods to support analysis tasks 
  Data management, data provenance, and data uncertainty 
  Theoretical foundations of Visual Analytics 
  Cognitive and perceptual aspects 
  Infrastructures and architectures for Visual Analytics systems and services 
  Visual Analytics applications 
  Evaluation of Visual Analytics techniques and procedures 
  Position Papers   
 Position papers are problem discussions or statements describing the author’s relevant experience and ideas in regards to Visual Analytics. Position papers will be selected according to their importance and relevance for the workshop topics and how well they will fit the planned discussions.  
 Important dates   
 Submission deadline: 27 February, 2017  
  Notification of acceptance: 27 March, 2017  
  Camera-ready deadline: 24 April, 2017  
  EuroVA workshop: 12-13 June, 2017  
 Submission guidelines   
 Papers, 4 pages in length + 1 extra page for references (maximum) must be prepared using the EuroVA LaTeX template, which can be downloaded here: egPublStyle-EuroVA2017.zip   
 Papers are to be submitted via PCS at: https://precisionconference.com/~eurova17   
 At least one author of an accepted paper must register and participate in the workshop to present the accepted work. The EuroVA 2017 Workshop Proceedings will be published by the Eurographics Association, and be stored on the Eurographics Digital Library.
