 Conference on Cognitive and Computational Aspects of Situation Management (CogSIMA 2023)  
 October 16, 2023 through October 19, 2023  
 9:00 AM-6:00 PM  
 The 13th annual Conference on Cognitive and Computational Aspects of Situation Management ( CogSIMA  ) will be held in Behrakis Hall at Drexel University, from October 16-19, 2023. Hasan Ayaz  , PhD, associate professor in the School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems, is the organizing committee chair of this year's conference.  
   
  The Cognitive Situation Management (CogSIMA) conference series provides an annual venue for presenting multi-disciplinary research on complex heterogeneous dynamical systems – of interacting humans, machines, computer agents and/or networks – whose individual and/or collective behavior depends on their situation awareness.  
   
  The CogSIMA conferences are aimed at researchers and practitioners from academia, industry and government, with a wide variety of backgrounds and experience including computer science, human factors, cognitive science, modeling and simulation, robotics, and systems engineering.  
   
  Since 2011, the CogSIMA conferences have promoted a multidisciplinary approach to research on dynamic, cyber-physical-social systems of systems, emerging from the interaction of people, machines, computer systems and organizations situated in complex dynamic environments. Critical to these systems of systems are their cognitive and computational capabilities to (1) sense, perceive, comprehend, and predict situations; (2) reason about and recommend possible actions for situations; (3) facilitate learning, self-organization and collective intelligence; and (4) assess inter-dependencies between systems.  
   
  Continuing in its successful, interdisciplinary tradition, CogSIMA 2023  will provide an inspiring forum for scientists and practitioners from diverse backgrounds including cognitive science, computer science, artificial intelligence, psychology, and human factors.
