 International Symposium on Algorithmics of Wireless Networks 2023  
 The International Symposium on Algorithmics of Wireless Networks  (ALGOSENSORS)  is an international symposium dedicated to the algorithmic aspects of wireless networks. Originally focused on sensor networks, it now covers algorithmic issues arising in wireless networks of all types of computational entities, static or mobile, including sensor networks, sensor-actuator networks, autonomous robots. The focus is on the design and analysis of algorithms, models of computation, and experimental analysis. ALGOSENSORS 2023 will be held in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. It will be part of ALGO 2023  , which also hosts ALGOCLOUD  , ATMOS  , ESA  , IPEC  and WAOA  . link: https://algo-conference.org/2023/algowin/   
 Note  : Starting from 2023 the event adopts a broader scope of wireless networks in general and its new acronym becomes ALGOWIN.
