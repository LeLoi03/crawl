 Exhibitor Badges  
 You may have up to three exhibitors staffing your tabletop space. Each exhibitor must register for their own badge: We will provide the exhibitor registration link upon confirmation of your tabletop. Exhibitor badges grant access to the foyer exhibit area and hallway track.  
 If there's anyone from your company who wishes to attend the conference and also staff the table, their main conference registration will suffice. We can also give them an exhibitor ribbon at the registration desk on site on request.  
 If you will NOT be using your table, please let us know  by Monday, June 19, so that we can release the space to another vendor.  
 Exhibiting Hours  
 Tables will be available Monday morning through Wednesday afternoon and will receive peak traffic during the breaks, lunches, and the half hour after the last session ends on the evenings on Monday and Tuesday. Please note that lunch is “on your own” on Wednesday, so fewer attendees will be on site during this break. Overnight security for tables will not be available but USENIX staff can secure items in the show office on request.  
 You can see the overview of the OSDI program  to help plan your schedule.
