 Mission  
 The Asia-Pacific Conference on Conceptual Modelling provides an annual forum for disseminating the results of innovative research in information modelling and related areas. Topics of conference vary from conceptual modeling research and practice to all related areas that are mentioned in prime essay  and scientific journals.  
 The amount, complexity and diversity of information held in computer systems are constantly on the increase, and so are the requirements and challenges to be met for useful access and manipulation of this information. Conceptual modelling is fundamental to the development of up-to-date information and knowledge-based systems. The conference series aims on bringing together experts from all areas of computer science and information systems with a common interest in the subject.  
 Upcoming Conference  
 The Tenth Asia-Pacific Conference on Conceptual Modelling (APCCM 2014)  will take place in Auckland, New Zealand from January 20th to 23rd, 2014.  
 The 2014 conference will be held as part of the Australasian Computer Science Week (ACSW 2014).
