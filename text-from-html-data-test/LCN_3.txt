 Authors are invited to submit papers describing original, previously unpublished work, not currently under review by another conference, workshop, or journal. There are a number of tracks that are designed to improve interactions of experts over different stages in research development.  
 Full Regular papers | (maximum 8 pages plus references, 10 pt font in IEEE format) should present novel perspectives within the general scope of the conference. 
  Short papers | (maximum 6 pages plus references, 10 pt font in IEEE format) are an opportunity to present preliminary or interim results on hot topics in a poster session. 
  Doctoral track papers | (maximum 6 pages plus references, 10 pt font in IEEE format) provide a supportive setting for Ph.D. students (who must be the first author) to discuss their problem statement, methods, results, obtain feedback from established researchers and establish contacts for entering the job market. The doctoral track involves a mentoring program. 
  We are also holding dedicated special tracks (e.g., invited workshops, papers) focusing on nascent and promising areas in networking research, which shall involve experts in those areas seeking to foster collaborative development.  
 Full, short, special track, and doctoral papers are published in the IEEE LCN proceedings and IEEE Xplore. All published papers must include title, complete contact information for all authors, abstract, and keywords on the cover page. IEEE reserves the right to remove papers from IEEE Xplore that are not presented at the conference.  
 Paper Submission:  Papers must be registered on EDAS and submitted in PDF format. Detailed submission instructions are available at the conference website  . Direct your questions to Program Chairs: Florian Tschorsch and Kanchana Thilakarathna ( program@ieeelcn.org  ).  
 A limited number of students grants and N 2  Women Young Researcher Fellowship awards are considered by the conference each year.

  Remote Presentation Option:  LCN considers in-person meetings indispensable for collaborations, personal exchanges, discussions, and networking opportunities. Recognizing the evolving landscape of academic conferences and the need for flexibility, LCN 2024 introduces a Remote Presentation Option.  
 Upon acceptance/registration, authors have the option to select physical or remote presentation modes. When opting for remote presentation, a fee of 500 USD is required in addition to the author registration. This fee covers supplementary costs associated with providing a remote option. The additional fee for remote presentations may be waived when all authors are from countries marked with an asterisk on the following list of IEEE eMembership Countries: https://www.ieee.org/membership/join/emember-countries.html  .  
 Remote presentation is restricted to full, short, and doctoral papers. Further implementation details will be communicated as part of the author and presenter instructions.  
 The overarching goal of LCN 2024 is to enhance the accessibility and inclusivity of LCN, catering to a diverse global audience while preserving the value of physical participation.
