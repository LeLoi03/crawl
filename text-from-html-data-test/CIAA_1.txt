 The CIAA conferences concern research on all aspects of implementation and application of automata and related structures, including theoretical aspects.  
   
  The next CIAA conference will be held in  
   
  Palermo, Italy, from September 23 to 26, 2025

 Mission Statement and Topics   
 Automata theory is the foundation of computer science. Its applications have spread to almost all areas of computer science and many other disciplines. In addition, there is a growing number of software systems designed to manipulate automata, regular expressions, grammars, and related structures; examples include AGL, AMORE, Automate, FADELA, FinITE, FireLite, FLAP, FSM, Grail, INR, Intex, ASTL, MONA, and Turing's World.  
    
 The purpose of these conferences is to bring together members of the academic, research and industrial community who have an interest in implementation and application of automata to demonstrate and analyze their work and to explain the problems they have been solving.   
  
  We solicit papers and demos on all aspects of implementation and application of automata and related structures, including theoretical aspects, as but not limited to:   

 Complexity of Automata Operations 
  Compilers 
  Computer-aided verification 
  Concurrency 
  Data structure design for automata 
  Data and image compression 
  Design and architecture of automata software 
  Digital libraries 
  DNA/molecular/membrane computing 
  Document engineering 
  Editors, environments 
  Experimental studies and practical experiences 
  Industrial applications 
  Natural language processing 
    
 Networking 
  New algorithms for manipulating automata 
  Object-oriented modeling 
  Pattern-matching 
  Quantum computing 
  Speech and speaker recognition 
  Structured and semi-structured documents 
  Symbolic manipulation environments for automata 
  Teaching 
  Text processing 
  Techniques for graphical display of automata 
  VLSI 
  Viruses, related phenomena
