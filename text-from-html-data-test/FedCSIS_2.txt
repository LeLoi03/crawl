 Preface   
 Dear  it is our pleasure to present to you Proceedings of the 18 th  Conference on Computer Science and Intelligence Systems (FedCSIS 2023), which took place on September 17-20, 2023, in Warsaw, Poland.  
 FedCSIS 2023 was chaired by Jaros≈Çaw Arabas and S≈Çawomir Zadro≈ºny, while Przemys≈Çaw Biecek acted as the Chair of the Organizing Committee. This year, FedCSIS was organized by the Polish Information Processing Society (Mazovia Chapter), IEEE Poland Section Computer Society Chapter, Systems Research Institute of Polish Academy of Sciences, as well as Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology and Faculty of Mathematics and Information Sciences of Warsaw University of Technology.  
 FedCSIS 2023 was technically co-sponsored by IEEE Poland Section, IEEE Czechoslovakia Section Computer Society Chapter, IEEE Poland Section Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society Chapter, IEEE Poland Section Computational Intelligence Society Chapter, Committee of Computer Science of Polish Academy of Sciences, and Mazovia Cluster ICT. Moreover, two years ago, the FedCSIS conference series formed strategic alliance with QED Software, a Polish software company developing AI-based products, and this collaboration has been continued.  
 FedCSIS 2023 was sponsored by QED Software, Samsung, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, ≈Åukasiewicz Research Network ‚Äì Institute of Innovative Technologies EMAG, MDPI, Sages, Efigo, and CloudFerro.  
 This year, another round of evolutionary adaptations, to the FedCSIS conference series, took place. Specifically, they concerned the conference structure. Post conference publications (Proceedings, Position Papers and Communication Papers volumes) illustrate the direction of this evolutionary process. In short, starting from 2023, FedCSIS conferences have Main Track with five Topical Areas, Thematic Tracks and, possibly, Competitions. The new structure emphasizes the integrity of the conference. For all five Topical Areas, situated within a general domain of Computer Science, the continually emerging topic of Intelligence Systems, stands as the common denominator. All Thematic Tracks refer to Intelligence Systems as well, from different perspectives. Even Competitions, having strong roots in the realm of AI, data science, machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing, are regarded as a path toward introducing more Intelligence into Computer Science and IT.  
 In this context, these Proceedings consist of six parts. Part 1 contains Invited Contributions. Part 2 collects Main Track full contributions (arranged alphabetically, according to the last name of the first author, with Topical Area represented in the metadata). Part 3 contains Main Track short contributions. Part 4 contains full contributions, originating from Thematic Tracks. (Again, texts are arranged alphabetically, according to the last name of the first author, with the name of Thematic Track stated in the metadata.) Part 5 collects short papers from all Thematic Tracks. Finally, Part 6 is devoted to Competitions that run within the context of FedCSIS conferences.  
 Keeping this in mind, let us now introduce Keynote Speakers, the remaining Invited Contributions, and the five Topical Areas of FedCSIS 2023 Main Track.  
 I. Invited Contributions  
 FedCSIS 2023 invited four keynote lecturers to deliver lectures matching Topical Areas and thus providing a broader context for the conference participants. Moreover, two past FedCSIS keynote speakers have been invited to prepare contributions, which refer to the core focus of the conference series. There are also two contributions corresponding to the additional invited talks and three contributions corresponding to tutorials. The aforementioned common denominator of all FedCSIS Topical Areas is clearly visible in this part. First, we can see here the core AI works on trustworthiness and robustness of neuro-symbolic and neural network models. Second, there are contributions related to the foundations of intelligent decision making and uncertainty modeling, using tools taken e.g. from soft computing and information theory. On the other hand, we have also contributions referring to machine learning and data science software, as well as examples of applications of AI methods in practical domains. This generally reflects our understanding of the place of Intelligence Systems in the realm of Computer Science. Namely, according to our vision, it is to develop and adjust the AI-related methods to let them work efficiently as the essential component of modern software systems and solutions.  
 II. Advanced Artificial Intelligence in Applications  
 This Topical Area is a conceptual continuation of a series of international AAIA Symposiums, which have been held since 2006. It aims at covering wide range of core aspects of AI. Nowadays, AI is usually perceived as closely related to the data, therefore, the scope of this Topical Area includes elements of machine learning, data science, and big data processing, with important emerging aspects such as interactive learning and human-centered AI, as well as interpretable learning, explainable AI, and the aforementioned topic of trustworthiness. Furthermore, since the realm of AI is far richer, the ultimate goal of this Topical Area is to show relationships between all of AI subareas, emphasizing a cross-disciplinary nature of various research branches. In 2023, the collection of papers accepted to this Topical Area has reflected this cross-disciplinary nature particularly well. We can see here various areas of AI (also outside so-called ‚Äúcore AI‚Äù), as well as a mix of theoretical and practical contributions. From the perspective of the general scope of FedCSIS, this Topical Area embraces particularly AI methods and examples of their applications in different practical fields.  
 This Topical Area is curated by:  
 + Corizzo, Roberto, American University, USA  
 + Sosnowski, ≈Åukasz, Systems Research Institute of Polish Academy of Sciences, Poland  
 + Szczuka, Marcin, University of Warsaw, Poland  
 + Zdravevski, Eftim, Ss. Cyril and Methodius University, Macedonia  
 III. Computer Science & Systems  
 This Topical Area aims at integrating and creating synergy between Computer Science and related disciplines, with AI being of the core interest. The area‚Äôs scope spans themes ranging from hardware issues close to computer engineering via software issues tackled by the theory and applications of Computer Science. When compared to the previously-discussed Topical Area on ‚ÄúAdvanced Artificial Intelligence in Applications‚Äù, herein we are interested more in software system realizations and computational aspects. Therefore, we make a step from AI regarded as the set of methods towards Intelligence Systems understood as software systems with the elements of AI. As an example, the domains such as reinforcement learning or AI-based games and simulations are studied here not only from the perspective of the quality of obtained results but also taking into account their performance, resource consumption, and scalability.

 IV. Network Systems & Applications  
 Modern network systems encompass a wide range of solutions and technologies, including wireless and wired networks, network systems, services, and applications. On the one hand, network technologies are used in majority of areas that make human life easier and more comfortable. On the other hand, the rapid need for network deployment brings new challenges in network management and network design, which are reflected in hardware, software, services, and security-related problems. Going back to the main scope of FedCSIS, it is obvious that appropriate network solutions are one of the crucial layers of scalable modern software systems, including those with the elements of AI. On the other hand, equally obviously, AI methods can be useful to make network systems and their applications more efficient. Accordingly, the aim of this Topical Area is to bring more Intelligence into network systems. Moreover, besides network systems, one should think also about network models, network algorithms, etc. Therefore, this Topical Area covers not only the technological side, but also the societal and social impacts of network developments.

 + Awad, Ali Ismail, United Arab Emirates University, United Arab Emirates  
 + Furtak, Janusz, Military University of Technology, Poland  
 + Hodo≈à, Michal, University of ≈Ωilina, Slovakia  
 + Suri, Niranjan, Institute of Human and Machine Cognition, United States  
 V. Information Technology for Business & Society  
 The aim this Topical Area is to integrate and create synergy between disciplines of IT, Intelligence Systems, and social sciences. Collected contributions address issues relevant to IT and necessary for practical, everyday needs of business, other organizations and society at large. Moreover, they take a socio-technical view on Intelligence Systems and, at the same time, relate to ethical, social and political issues that they raise. Thus, from the viewpoint of the FedCSIS as a whole, this Topical Area goes beyond Computer Science itself. It refers to the fact that every software system or solution, and especially a system or solution with some flavors of Intelligence, needs to be carefully deployed in real life. In other words, it is not only about machines ‚Äì it is also about humans. Accordingly, this Topical Area embraces particularly research on methods and processes of adoption of AI and Intelligence Systems in society and particular markets of business applications. Going back to one of the aforementioned invited contributions, the means for trustworthiness can be regarded as an important tool in such processes too.

 VI. Software, System & Service Engineering  
 For decades, an open question in the software industry remains, how to provide fast and effective software process and software services, and how to come to software systems, embedded systems, autonomous systems, or cyber-physical systems that will address the open issue of supporting information management process in many, particularly complex organization systems. Even more, it is a hot issue how to provide a synergy between systems in common, and software services as a mandatory component of each modern organization, particularly in terms of IoT, big data, and Industry 4.0 paradigms. Therefore, the main goal of this Topical Area is to address open questions and real potentials for various applications of modern approaches and technologies to develop and implement effective software services in a support of information management and system engineering. We can see here a clear linkage to AI and Intelligence Systems as well. On the one hand (going back to one of invited talks reported in Invited Contributions), AI tools can be applied to improve the quality of software and to optimize the performance of computer systems. While on the other hand (going back again to one of the papers associated with the FedCSIS 2023 keynote lectures), AI-based models and algorithms need to be tested, maintained and monitored just like any other components of complex software systems.

 VII. Zdzis≈Çaw Pawlak Awards  
 The above-described five Topical Areas of FedCSIS Main Track reflect five fundamental aspects of understanding, developing, and applying Intelligence Systems. This topical integrity is emphasized by the Professor Zdzis≈Çaw Pawlak award, considered in four categories: Best Paper, Young Researcher, Industry Cooperation, and International Cooperation. Over time, this award has gone through significant evolution together with the FedCSIS conference series. Originally, it was granted only to papers published within the series of AAIA Symposiums. However, although Professor Zdzis≈Çaw Pawlak has been often recognized as ‚Äúthe father of Polish AI‚Äù, his research achievements have gone far beyond AI itself, in particular, toward AI applications and Intelligence Systems as we mean them. Accordingly, over time, we decided to expand this award to the whole conference ‚Äì not only all Main Track Topical Areas but also all Thematic Tracks.  
 This year, Award Committee (a part of FedCSIS Senior Program Committee) had a particularly hard task to select a single winner of Best Paper Award. Therefore, after discussion, additional paper was distinguished with Distinction Award. The following contributions have been awarded:  
 In the category | Best Paper: | Julian Premm, Hagen Peukert, Dennis R√∂ssel, Mareike Silber, for the paper ‚ÄûAnalysis of a GPT-3 chatbot with respect to its input in a sales dialogue‚Äù 
  Additional | Distinction Award: | Giovanna Castellano, Pasquale De Marinis, Gennaro Vessio, for the paper ‚ÄûApplying Knowledge Distillation to Improve Weed Mapping With Drones‚Äù 
  In the category | Young Researcher: | Anastasiya Danilenka, for the paper ‚ÄûMitigating the effects of non-IID data in federated learning with a self-adversarial balancing method‚Äù 
  In the category | Industry Cooperation: | Miko≈Çaj Pudo, Mateusz Wosik, Artur Janicki, for the paper ‚ÄûOpen Vocabulary Keyword Spotting with Small-Footprint ASR-based Architecture and Language Models‚Äù 
  In the category | International Cooperation Award: | Samaneh Mohammadi, Mohammadreza Mohammadi, Sima Sinaei, Ehsan Nowroozi, Francesco Flammini, Mauro Conti, for the paper ‚ÄûBalancing Privacy and Accuracy in Federated Learning for Speech Emotion Recognition‚Äù 
  Industry Cooperation Award was sponsored by QED Software, International Cooperation Award ‚Äì by MDPI, while the remaining awards were sponsored by Mazovia Branch of Polish Information Processing Society. Here, it is also worth noting that each of those five papers comes from a different Topical Area or Thematic Track. Yet, they are all aligned with what we described before as the FedCSIS common denominator.  
 VIII. Statistics  
 Each contribution, found in this volume, was refereed by at least two referees and the acceptance rate of regular full papers was approximately 19% (68 accepted contributions, out of 358 general submissions).

  X. Acknowledgments  
 In conclusion, let us emphasize that delivery of FedCSIS 2023 required a dedicated effort of many people. We would like to express our warmest gratitude to all Topical Area Curators, to the members of the Senior Program Committee and to the members of the Program Committee, for their hard work in attracting and reviewing all submissions. We thank the authors of papers for their great contribution to the theory and practice of Computer Science and Intelligence Systems. We are grateful to Keynote, Invited, and Tutorial Speakers, for sharing their knowledge and wisdom with the participants. Last, but not least, we acknowledge one more time Jaros≈Çaw Arabas, S≈Çawomir Zadro≈ºny, and Przemys≈Çaw Biecek. We are very grateful for your efforts!  
 We hope that you all had an inspiring conference. We also hope to meet you again for the 19th Conference on Computer Science and Intelligence Systems (FedCSIS 2024) which will take place in Belgrade, Serbia on September 8-11, 2024. Finally, we hope that you will find the evolution of the FedCSIS Conference concept as something that properly addresses the current needs of research and applications. We want to continue looking at Computer Science from different angles but in the same time, acknowledging the topic Intelligence Systems as the central point of everything that we are considering.

  Thematic Tracks  
 Preface to Thematic Tracks   
 Parts  4 and 5 of FedCSIS 2023 Proceedings contain contributions originating from Thematic Tracks. Let us present each one of them.  
 I. Advances in Programming Languages  
 Programming languages are programmers' most basic tools. With appropriate programming languages one can drastically reduce the cost of building new applications, as well as maintaining existing ones. In the last decades, there have been many advances in programming languages technology, in traditional programming paradigms such as functional, logic, and object-oriented programming, as well as the development of new paradigms, such as aspect-oriented programming. The main driving force was, and will be, to better express programmers' ideas. Therefore, research in programming languages is an endless activity and the core of computer science. New language features, new programming paradigms, and better compile-time and run-time mechanisms can be foreseen in the future. Here, the potential future role of AI models in programming should also be taken into account. In this context, the aim of this Thematic Track was to provide a forum for exchange of ideas and experience in topics concerned with programming languages and systems.

 VIII. Cyber-Physical Systems Software Engineering  
 This Thematic Track has its roots in the IEEE Software Engineering Workshop (SEW), which is the oldest Software Engineering event in the world, dating back to 1969. It was originally run as the NASA Software Engineering Workshop and focused on software engineering issues relevant to NASA and the space industry. After the 25th edition, it became the NASA/IEEE Software Engineering Workshop and expanded its remit to address many more areas of software engineering, with emphasis on practical issues, industrial experience and case studies in addition to traditional technical papers. Since its 31st edition, it has been sponsored by IEEE and has continued to broaden its areas of interest. Now it is an integral part of the FedCSIS conference series, as one of important Thematic Tracks.  
 One extremely hot new area are Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), which encompass the investigation of approaches related to the development and use of modern software systems interfacing with real world and controlling their surroundings. CPS are physical and engineering systems closely integrated with their typically networked environment. Modern airplanes, automobiles, or medical devices are practically networks of computers. Sensors, robots, and intelligent devices are abundant. Human life depends on them. CPS systems transform how people interact with the physical world just like the Internet transformed how people interact with one another. Accordingly, this Thematic Track brought together researchers with interest in software engineering, both with CPS and broader focus. Moreover, it provided a forum for reporting on past experiences, for describing new and emerging results and approaches, and for exchanging ideas on best practice and future directions.

 IX. Cyber Security, Privacy, and Trust  
 Nowadays, information security is a backbone for protecting both user data and electronic transactions. Protecting communications and data infrastructures of an increasingly inter-connected world have become vital. Security has also emerged as an important scientific discipline whose many multifaceted complexities require synergy of computer science, engineering, and information systems communities. Information security has some well-founded technical research directions which encompass access level (user authentication and authorization), protocol security, software security, and data cryptography. Moreover, some other emerging topics related to organizational security aspects have appeared beyond the long-standing research directions. In this context, this Thematic Track focused on the diversity of the cyber information security developments and deployments in order to highlight the most recent challenges and report the most recent researches. It was designed as an umbrella for all cyber security technical aspects, user privacy techniques, and trust. In addition, it went beyond the technicalities and covered some emerging topics like social and organizational security research directions. Thematic Track organizers:

 X. Data Science in Health, Ecology and Commerce  
 This Thematic Track was a forum for exchange of ideas concerning all forms of data analysis, data economics, information systems and data based research, focusing on the interaction of those three fields. Here, data-driven solutions can be generated by understanding complex real-world (health-related) problems, critical thinking and analytics to derive knowledge from (Big) data. The past years have shown a forthcoming interest on innovative data technology and analytics solutions that link and utilize large amounts of data across individual digital ecosystems. Here, scenarios, in the field of health, smart cities or agriculture, merge data from various IoT devices, social media or applications and demonstrate the great potential for gaining new insights, supporting decisions, or providing smarter services. Together with inexpensive sensors and computing power they provide foundation of a world that bases its decisions on data. However, this is only the beginning of the journey, and the pertinent methods and technologies, and the potential application fields, as well as the impact on society and economy, have to be explored. This endeavor needs the knowledge of researchers from different fields applying diverse perspectives and using different methodological directions to find a way to grasp and fully understand the power and opportunities of data science. Bringing together researchers and practitioners of pertinent fields was one of focal points of this Thematic Track.

 XI. Distributed Edge AI ‚Äì Risks and Challenges  
 The advent of end and edge nodes, with increased computational and storage capabilities, makes it possible to perform a large range of computations, with special focus on AI-based tasks on privacy-sensitive data, locally at the edge. This makes it possible to rely on a backend cloud only for communicating results of non-private data, for example by aggregation, or performing computations requiring the combination and further processing of results from different edge devices, or historical data sources, as it is done in the federated learning approaches. In addition, this increase in computation capabilities enables also neighboring edge devices to perform tasks collaboratively, leveraging each other's computational resources, before offloading data and computations to the cloud backend. This Thematic Track focused on AI and ML techniques related to edge computing systems, and security and privacy approaches in view of data sharing, in order to enable smart and sustainable planning and operation of resource constrained IoT ecosystems, and edge computing applications. It was organized within the scope of the European ITEA3 MIRAI R&D project. Thematic Track organizers:

 XX. Scalable Computing  
 The world of large-scale computing continuously evolves. The most recent addition to the mix comes from numerous data streams that materialize from exploding number of cheap sensors installed ‚Äúeverywhere‚Äù, on the one hand, and ability to capture and study events with systematically increasing granularity, on the other. To address the needs for scaling computational and storage infrastructures, concepts like: edge, fog and dew computing emerged. Novel issues, involved in ‚Äúpushing computing away from the center‚Äù, did not replace open questions that existed in the context of grid and cloud computing. Rather, they added new dimensions of complexity and resulted in the need of addressing scalability across more and more complex ecosystems consisting of individual sensors and micro-computers (e.g. Raspberry PI based systems) as well as supercomputers available within the Cloud (e.g. Cray computers and/or machines for large ML model training, facilitated ‚Äì for instance ‚Äì within the MS Azure Cloud). Addressing research questions that arise in individual ‚Äúparts‚Äù as well as across the ecosystem viewed from a holistic perspective, with scalability as the main focus, was the goal of this Thematic Track.

 PolEval  is an annual NLP challenge organized since 2017. The choice of the name of the challenge was deliberate: as most research concentrates on the most popular languages (especially English), the aim of PolEval was to promote work on processing Polish. By focusing on Polish, it actively promotes the creation of new resources in this language, facilitates further research and contributes to creating new and improved methods and models for Polish.  
 The goal of PolEval is thus to:  
 develop established procedures for evaluating systems solving a wide range of tasks in NLP, 
  create annotated datasets that can be used for training and evaluation of systems, 
  objectively compare systems performing various tasks in the field of natural language processing, 
  bring researchers from the scientific and business communities closer together and exchanging knowledge between them, 
  facilitate popularization of NLP issues in the context of the Polish language. 
  To achieve these goals, PolEval proposes a well-formulated task framework in which the scope, input data, expected output data, evaluation methods training and test data are prepared by the organizers. This way the challenge aims to be a platform for objective comparison of methods, models and systems for processing Polish.

  Cybersecurity Threat Detection in the Behavior of IoT Devices  
 Preface to Cybersecurity Threat Detection in the Behavior of IoT Devices   
 Cybersecurity  Threat Detection in the Behavior of IoT Devices was the 9th competition organized in association with the FedCSIS conference series at KnowledgePit.ai. The goal was to detect attacks on IoT devices on the basis of data provided by Efigo company, describing the changing behavior of devices, and known moments of cyberattack attempts. The data set was generated as a part of a SPINET project aiming at improving the cybersecurity of IoT device networks.  
 The increasing significance of many IoT device applications motivates scientists to develop techniques for cyber safety improvement in many ways. In our case, based on the changing device behavior, it was expected that the profile of processes running on the device should change during the attack attempts.  
 The competition data was collected in a simulated environment - IoT devices were emulated in a separated network, where attacking servers were also plugged in. The scenario of attacks was known, so it was possible to tag the behavioral data as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and ‚Äúunusual‚Äù. Based on that information participants tried to develop classification models to predict whether the device is being attacked or not.  
 The top four competitor groups were invited to submit a paper describing their solutions to our special event at the FedCSIS 2023 conference. These papers are included in this chapter of the conference proceedings and are preceded by a paper describing in detail the competition, authored by the organizers. The most of presented approaches were based on gradient-boosting algorithms. That is not surprising - such models play an essential role in different fields of application. However, they are not so easy to interpret which may cause difficulties in better understanding the nature of IoT devices' behavior change during cyberattacks.

  Center for Artificial Intelligence Challenge on Conversational AI Correctness  
 Preface to Center for Artificial Intelligence Challenge on Conversational AI Correctness   
 Center  Center for Artificial Intelligence Challenge on Conversational AI Correctness was organized as part of the 1st Symposium on Challenges for Natural Language Processing. The goal of this competition was to develop Natural Language Understanding models that are robust against speech recognition errors.  
 Regardless of near-human accuracy of Automatic Speech Recognition in general-purpose transcription tasks, speech recognition errors can significantly deteriorate the performance of a Natural Language Understanding model that follows the speech-to-text module in a virtual assistant. The problem is even more apparent when an ASR system from an external vendor is used as an integral part of a conversational system without any further adaptation. The contestants were expected to develop Natural Language Understanding models that maintain satisfactory performance despite the presence of ASR errors in the input.  
 The data for the competition consist of natural language utterances along with semantic frames that represent the commands targeted at a virtual assistant. The approach used to prepare the data for the challenge was meant to promote models robust to various types of errors in the input, making it impossible to solve the task by simply learning a shallow mapping from incorrectly recognized words to the correct ones. It reflects real-world scenarios where the NLU system is presented with inputs that exhibit various disturbances due to changes in the ASR model, acoustic conditions, speaker variation, and other causes.  
 This chapter includes the paper discussing the objectives, evaluation rules and results of the competition, authored by the organizers followed by the detailed description of the leading solution contributed by the winners of the challenge.

  Temporal Image Caption Retrieval Competition  
 Preface to Temporal Image Caption Retrieval Competition   
 Temporal  Image Caption Retrieval Competition was organized as part of the 1st Symposium on Challenges for Natural Language Processing. The goal of the competition was, given a picture from a newspaper and the newspaper's publication daily date, to retrieve a picture caption from a given caption set.  
 Multimodal models, especially combining vision and text, are gaining great recognition. One such multimodal challenge is Text-Image retrieval, which is to retrieve an image for a text query or retrieve a text for a given image. In this challenge, we introduce a task in the Text-Image retrieval setup, additionally extending the modalities with temporal data.  
 Language models rarely utilize any input information except for text. E.g additional data could be a text domain, document timestamp, website URL, or other metadata information. However, models trained solely on text data may be limited in usage. Additional temporal information is useful when factual knowledge is required, but the facts change over time.  
 The presented task is based on the Chronicling America [ Lee, B. C. G., Mears, J., Jakeway, E., Ferriter, M., Adams, C., Yarasavage, N., ‚Ä¶ & Weld, D. S.  (2020). The Newspaper Navigator Dataset: Extracting Headlines and Visual Content from 16 Million Historic Newspaper Pages in Chronicling America.  In Proceedings of the 29th ACM International Conference on Information & Knowledge Management (CIKM '20). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 3055‚Äì3062.  ] and Challenging America [ Pokrywka, J., Gralinski, F., Jassem, K., Kaczmarek, K., Jurkiewicz, K., & Wierzcho≈Ñ, P.  (2022, July). Challenging America: Modeling language in longer time scales.  In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: NAACL 2022 ( pp. 737-749  ).] projects. Chronicling America is an open database of over 16 million pages of digitized historic American newspapers covering 274 years. Challenging America is a set of temporal challenges built from the Chronicling America dataset.  
 This chapter includes the paper discussing the objectives, evaluation rules and results of the competition, authored by the organizers followed by the detailed description of the leading solution contributed by the winners of the challenge.
