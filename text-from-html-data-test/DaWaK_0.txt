 DaWaK conference is a high-quality forum for researchers, practitioners and developers in the field of Big Data Analytics, in a broad sense. The objective is to explore, disseminate and exchange knowledge in this field through scientific and industry talks. The conference covers all aspects of DaWaK research and practice, including data lakes, database design (data warehouse design, ER modelling), big data management (tables + text + files), query languages (SQL and beyond), parallel systems technology (Spark, MapReduce, HDFS), theoretical foundations and applications, text and data mining techniques, and deep learning. The conference will bring together active researchers from the database systems, cloud computing, programming languages and data science communities worldwide. Main topics include: Theoretical models for extended data warehouses and big data Conceptual model foundations for big data Modelling diverse big data sources Parallel processing Parallel DBMS technology Distributed system architectures Scalability and parallelization using Map-Reduce, Spark, and related systems Query languages Query processing and optimization Semantics for big data intelligence Data warehouse and data lake architectures Pre-processing and data cleaning Integration of data warehousing, OLAP cubes, and data mining Polystore and multistore architectures NoSQL storage systems Cloud infrastructures for big data Metadata for big data frameworks Big data storage and indexing Big data analytics: algorithms, techniques, and systems Big data quality and provenance Big data search and discovery Big data management for mobile applications Analytic workflows Graph analytics Analytics for unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data Analytics for temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal, and mobile data Analytics for data streams and sensor data Real-time/right-time and event-based analytics Privacy and security in analytics Data visualization Big data application deployment Data science products Novel applications of text mining for big data Machine learning: auto AI, deep learning applications  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2023-01-22
