 Call for papers, International Symposium on Memory Management (ISMM 2023)  
 Deadline:  3/3/2023  
 The 2023 ACM SIGPLAN International Symposium on Memory Management (ISMM 2023) is soliciting full-length submissions covering new work on all memory management related topics, as well as papers presenting confirmations or refutations of important prior results. In additional to regular papers, traditionally submitted to ISMM, we also invite submissions of the following kinds: * Surveys and comparative analyses that shed new light on previously published techniques. * Practitioner reports, describing experience with memory management in production. Such papers are not expected to provide novel research contributions, but they should not have been previously published. * Intellectual abstracts, where researchers share designs, algorithms, or theory that may be interesting to the memory management community, but not yet evaluated. Please indicate whether the paper is a regular paper, a survey, a practitioner report, or an intellectual abstract, by using a subtitle. For example, for a regular paper, include on of the following on the line below the title line: `\subtitle{This submission is a regular paper}`, `\subtitle{This submission is a survey}`, `\subtitle{This submission is a practitioner report}`, or `\subtitle{This submission is an intellectual abstract}`. ISMM 2023 will be colocated with [PLDI 2023](https://pldi23.sigplan.org/) at [FCRC'23](https://fcrc.acm.org/). Areas of interest include but are not limited to: * Garbage collection algorithms and implementations * Memory allocation and de-allocation * Memory system design and analysis * Hardware support for memory management * Memory management for large-scale data-intensive systems * Novel memory architectures * Memory management at datacenter and cloud scales * Formal analysis and verification of memory management algorithms * Compiler analyses to aid memory management * Tools to analyze memory usage of programs * Empirical analysis of memory intensive programs * Formal analysis and verification of memory intensive programs * Memory management for machine learning systems * Programming and management of emerging or persistent memories The symposium welcomes industry practitioners presenting their recent practice and findings in memory management related to real-world deployments. ## Formatting Instructions All papers must be submitted on-line in Portable Document Format (PDF). Papers should be formatted according to the two-column ACM proceedings format. Each paper should have no more than 12 pages, excluding bibliography, in 10pt font. There is no limit on the page count for references. Each reference must list all authors of the paper (do not use et al). The citations should be in numeric style, e.g., `[52]`. Submissions should be in PDF format and printable on US Letter and A4 sized paper. These requirements are all the same as in the previous years. Papers that exceed the length requirement or deviate from the expected format will be rejected. Make sure that figures and tables are legible, even after the paper is printed in gray-scale. Appendices should not be part of the paper, but should be submitted as supplementary material. Supplementary material should also be anonymized, as described below. As explained in more detail at http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author, authors should use the sigplan subformat of the acmart format. Please note the following: The first two lines should be: ``` \documentclass[sigplan,10pt,review,anonymous]{acmart} \settopmatter{printfolios=true,printccs=false,printacmref=false} ``` The default citation style is numeric. **Do not** mess with the class file or settings to try to sneak in additional space. (Conversely, you may toggle the printccs and printacmref flags if you wish, but these changes will consume space.) **Do not** use the PACMPL files or format; ISMM is not using them. However, the template files were designed to make migrating a paper from one format to the other as simple as possible. ## Double-Blind Reviewing ISMM uses double-blind reviewing. This means that author names and affiliations must be omitted from the submission. Additionally, if the submission refers to prior work done by the authors, that reference should be made in third person. These are firm submission requirements. Any supplementary material must also be anonymized. PLDIâ€™s [FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing](https://pldi23.sigplan.org/track/pldi-2023-pldi#FAQ-on-Double-Blind-Reviewing) clarifies the policy for the most common scenarios. But there are many gray areas and trade-offs. If you have any doubts about how to interpret the double blind rules, please contact the Program Chair. If in any doubt you should contact the Program Chair for complex cases that are not fully covered by the FAQ. ## Declaring Conflicts When submitting the paper, you will need to declare potential conflicts. Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc). Other conflicts include institutional conflicts, financial conflicts of interest, friends or relatives, or any recent co-authors on papers and proposals (last 2 years). Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are especially harmful if the aim is to exclude potential reviewers, so spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about a conflict, please consult the Program Chair. ## Author Response The author response process will occur in April 2023 (see Important Dates on the [main page](https://conf.researchr.org/home/ismm-2023)), and will give the authors an opportunity to respond to factual errors in reviews before the Program Committee meets to make its decisions. The committee may, but need not, respond to the author response or revise reviews at or after the committee meeting. ## Acknowledgements This call-for-papers is an adaptation and evolution of content from previous instances of ISMM and PLDI. We are grateful to prior organizers for their work, which is reused here.
