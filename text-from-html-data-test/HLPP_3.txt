   [Apologies if you receive multiple copies of this Call for Participation] CALL FOR PARTICIPATION >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> HLPP 2023 16th International Symposium on International Symposium on High-Level Parallel Programming and Applications Cluj-Napoca, Romania June 29-30, 2023 https://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/hlpp2023  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  Aims and Scope As processor and system manufacturers adjust their roadmaps towards increasing levels of both inter and intra-chip parallelism, so the urgency of reorienting the mainstream software industry towards these architectures grows. At present, popular parallel and distributed programming methodologies are dominated by low-level techniques such as send/receive message passing, or equivalently unstructured shared memory mechanisms. Higher-level, structured approaches offer many possible advantages and have a key role to play in the scalable exploitation of ubiquitous parallelism. HLPP symposia provide a forum for discussion and research about such high-level approaches to parallel and distributed programming. Topics * High-level parallel programming and performance models (e.g. BSP, CGM, LogP, MPM, etc.) and tools * Declarative parallel and distributed programming methodologies based on functional, logical, data-flow, actor, and other paradigms * Algorithmic skeletons, patterns, etc. and constructive methods * High-level parallelism in programming languages and libraries (e.g, OCaml, Haskell, Scala, C++, etc.): semantics and implementation * Verification of declarative parallel and distributed programs * Efficient code generation, auto-tuning, and optimization for parallel and distributed programs * Model-driven software engineering for parallel and distributed systems * Domain-specific languages: design, implementation, and applications * High-level programming models for heterogeneous/hierarchical platforms with accelerators, e.g., GPU, Many-core, DSP, VPU, FPGA, etc. * High-level parallel methods for large structured and semi-structured datasets * Applications of parallel and distributed systems using high-level languages and tools * Teaching experience with high-level tools and methods for parallel and distributed computing Past HLPP Symposia: https://hlpp.eu<https://hlpp.eu/  > >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  Invited Keynote Dana Petcu, West University of Timișoara, Romania: "Extreme Data Processing in Exascale Systems< https://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/hlpp2023/wp-content/uploads/Dana-Petcu-HLPP-2023-keynote-abstract.pdf  >" >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Organization * Virginia Niculescu, “Babeş-Bolyai” University of Cluj-Napoca, Romania * Adrian Sterca, “Babeş-Bolyai” University of Cluj-Napoca, Romania * Darius Bufnea, “Babeş-Bolyai” University of Cluj-Napoca, Romania Steering Committee * Gaétan Hains (Université Paris-Est Créteil, France) * Clemens Grelck (Universiteit van Amsterdam, Netherlands) * Kiminori Matsuzaki (Kochi University of Technology, Japan) * Christoph W.
