  Call For Papers  
  FLOPS 2024: 17th International Symposium on Functional and Logic Programming  
  ============================================================  
   
  May 15-17, 2024, Kumamoto, Japan  
  https://conf.researchr.org/home/flops-2024   

  FLOPS aims to bring together practitioners, researchers and implementers  
  of declarative programming, to discuss mutually interesting results and  
  common problems: theoretical advances, their implementations in language  
  systems and tools, and applications of these systems in practice. The  
  scope includes all aspects of the design, semantics, theory,  
  applications, implementations, and teaching of declarative programming.  
  FLOPS specifically aims to promote cross-fertilization between theory  
  and practice and among different styles of declarative programming.  
   
  Previous FLOPS meetings were held at Fuji Susono (1995), Shonan Village  
  (1996), Kyoto (1998), Tsukuba (1999), Tokyo (2001), Aizu (2002), Nara  
  (2004), Fuji Susono (2006), Ise (2008), Sendai (2010), Kobe (2012),  
  Kanazawa (2014), Kochi (2016), Nagoya (2018), Akita (2020, online), and  
  Kyoto (2022, online).  

  *** Scope ***  
   
  FLOPS solicits original papers in all areas of declarative programming:  
   
  * functional, logic, functional-logic programming, rewriting systems,  
  formal methods and model checking, program transformations and program  
  refinements, developing programs with the help of theorem provers or  
  SAT/SMT solvers, verifying properties of programs using declarative  
  programming techniques;  
   
  * foundations, language design, implementation issues (compilation  
  techniques, memory management, run-time systems, etc.), applications and  
  case studies.  
   
  FLOPS promotes cross-fertilization among different styles of declarative  
  programming. Therefore, research papers must be written to be  
  understandable by a wide audience of declarative programmers and  
  researchers. In particular, each submission should explain its  
  contributions in both general and technical terms, clearly identifying  
  what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant for its  
  area, and comparing it with previous work. Submission of system  
  descriptions and declarative pearls are especially encouraged.  

  *** Submission ***  
   
  Submissions should fall into one of the following categories:  
   
  * Regular research papers: they should describe new results and will be  
  judged on originality, correctness, and significance.  
   
  * System descriptions: they should describe a working system and will be  
  judged on originality, usefulness, and design.  
   
  * Declarative pearls: new and excellent declarative programs or theories  
  with illustrative applications.  
   
  System descriptions and declarative pearls must be explicitly marked as  
  such in the title. Submissions must be unpublished and not submitted for  
  publication elsewhere. Work that already appeared in unpublished or  
  informally published workshops proceedings may be submitted. Submissions  
  must be written in English and can be up to 15 pages excluding  
  references, though system descriptions and pearls are typically shorter.  
  The formatting has to conform to Springerâ€™s LNCS guidelines. FLOPS 2024  
  will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process.  
   
  For more details, see  
   
  https://conf.researchr.org/home/flops-2024   
   
  Papers should be submitted electronically at  
   
  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=flops2024   

  *** Publication ***  
   
  The proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS series. We  
  expect to invite the authors of a selection of the best papers to submit  
  an extended version of their FLOPS paper to a special issue which will  
  appear in the journal Science of Computer Programming.  

  *** Important Dates ***  
   
  All deadlines are Anywhere on Earth (AoE = UTC-12).  
   
  * Abstract due: Wed 6th Dec 2023  
  * Submission deadline: Wed 13th Dec 2023  
  * Notifications: Wed 31st Jan 2024  
  * Final versions due: Wed 28th Feb 2024
