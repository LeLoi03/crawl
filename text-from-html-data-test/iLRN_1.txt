 The Immersive Learning Research Network (iLRN)   is an international nonprofit 501(c)3 organization of designers, artists, developers, educators, and research experts collaborating to achieve our mission:   
 "Co-creating  the professional association advancing the quality of immersive learning to benefit humanity and our world." 
  Latest News | JOURNAL   Call for Papers: Special Issue on "Immersive Learning: From Theory to Practice, Building Evidence-Based Frameworks"    The manuscript submission deadline has been extended to December 15, 2025.  
  We are happy to announce a Call for Papers for a special issue in the journal "Computers & Education: X Reality", which is organized with iLRN and invites selected papers submitted to and presented at the 9th and 10th iLRN conferences to submit extended versions. However, submissions from the academic community are welcomed, regardless of whether they were part of the iLRN conferences.  
  Overview  
  The integration of immersive technologies—such as Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR)—into educational environments has shown significant potential to transform the learning experience. However, the rapid adoption of these technologies has outpaced the development of comprehensive, evidence-based frameworks that guide their practical implementation and evaluation in diverse educational contexts.  
  Immersive Learning is emerging from multi-disciplinary research in Computer Science, Game Design, UX, the Learning Sciences, and other fields that apply Immersive Learning in context. This special issue of Computers & Education: X Reality aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice in immersive learning by bringing together research that explores theoretical foundations and builds robust frameworks grounded in empirical evidence. We seek contributions that provide insights into how immersive technologies can be systematically integrated into educational settings to enhance learning outcomes, showing effective practices in immersive learning, addressing educational challenges and the technical affordances of tools and frameworks that are both scalable and sustainable.  
  This special issue is organized with the Immersive Learning Research Network (iLRN). Selected papers submitted to and presented at the 9th and 10th annual International Conferences will be invited to submit extended versions to this Special Issue. Extended versions of papers submitted to the iLRN Conference must contain about 50% new material, and the title must clearly and unmistakably differ from the title of the article presented at the conference.  
  Likewise, we welcome submissions from the academic community, regardless of whether they were part of the iLRN conferences.  
  Topics of Interest  
  This special issue invites scholars, practitioners, and technologists to contribute to the evolving landscape of immersive learning by providing research that advances theoretical understanding and offers practical, evidence-based solutions for educators worldwide.  
  We invite high-quality, original research articles, case studies, and review papers that address, but are not limited to, the following topics:  
  Theoretical Foundations  
  Conceptual models and frameworks for immersive learning. Cognitive, social, and emotional theories underlying immersive learning environments. Ethical considerations and inclusivity in immersive learning. Practical Applications  
  Case studies showcasing the integration of immersive technologies in various educational settings. Design and development of immersive learning environments. Best practices for implementing VR/AR/MR in classrooms, labs, and remote learning contexts. Evidence-Based Frameworks

  WEBINAR   Redefining Skill Development: Immersive Technology as a Catalyst for Equity in the Workforce    Presenter: Cristina Imperial Carl, Founder and CEO, Ediphi This insightful webinar explores how immersive technology is revolutionizing skill development and promoting equity in the workforce. We discuss how immersive technology can be customized to meet the unique learning preferences and needs of underrepresented workers. You’ll learn about the intersection of immersive tech with cognitive diversity, leveraging VR and AR to support neurodiverse individuals and those with varying education levels. We also dive into how integrating soft skills training within immersive platforms can build confidence and communication skills in workers facing systemic barriers. Additionally, we explore the potential of immersive simulations in minimizing unconscious bias in both training and hiring processes. Hear real-world examples of how immersive tech has created equitable career pathways for marginalized communities in non-traditional sectors. The webinar recording is available on the iLRN YouTube channel. https://youtu.be/LCRxrWFV-E8 
  GUIDED VIRTUAL ADVENTURE   Dive into VR Storytelling with novelist Helen Lundström Erwin!    Join us on October 24, 2024 at 9 am Pacific / 12 pm Eastern / 4 pm GMT for an exciting Guided Virtual Adventure about VR Storytelling! We are delighted to welcome Helen Lundström Erwin as our guide. This adventure will be hosted by Amany Alkhayat in Engage VR. The Engage event code is 2a0K6. The code contains a zero, not the letter O. If you are new to Engage, you can create an Engage account here: https://engagevr.io/download-engage/ Helen Lundström Erwin is recognized as the only novelist with a VR World based on a setting in their own novel. Her historical novel Sour Milk in Sheep’s Wool not only explores the early reproductive rights and suffrage movements but also inspired her VR World, The Foremothers Café. This VR Café takes you back in time to Lund, Sweden in 1918. Just like in the story, it serves as a community space for women, where Helen hosts discussions and cultural events, extending the themes of her writing into a dynamic, interactive environment. Her latest work, The Lure of Water and Wood, marks her foray into historical fantasy, drawing from real sorcery trials in 17th and 18th century Sweden, blending meticulous research with imaginative storytelling. Helen’s first novel, James’ Journey, further showcases her ability to weave deep historical insights into compelling narratives, portraying the transformative journey of a man from a pro-slavery upbringing to a conductor on the Underground Railroad. Helen has created artwork for The Foremothers Café and illustrated her Children's Book, Officer Helga Hedgehog Meets the New Neighbors. She is an active member of the Historical Novel Society-New York Chapter and of XR Women. She was honored with a 2021 (SWEA) Mona Johnson - New York Scholarship, and received a grant from The Puffin Foundation. The Foremothers Café has been nominated for Auggie Awards for Best Social Impact two years in a row, and Helen was nominated for an XR Women Award in the Trailblazing Category in 2023. Helen now serves as Secretary of the Board of SWEA (Swedish Women's Educational Association.) 
  VIRTUAL CAMPUS   Our iLRNetwork Virtual Campus is open!    University student use of the iLRN Virtual Campus XR groups meet for presentations & exploration iLRN Volunteers starting Campus Co-design - now building a spooky Halloween party! Beginning construction of iLRN's Foundations Research Library on campus on the immersive learning principles of Computer Science, Games, & the Learning Sciences Our new iLRN Frame VR Campus opened to attendees of the 10th annual iLRN Conference last June 2024. Of the collection of 25 Frame buildings on the new campus, most iLRN2024 activity took place on the dual Frame campus "hub" - that is, our Orange and Blue Exhibit Halls, respectively - where presenters from BOTH online and face-to-face (Scotland) conference venues had opportunity to place a poster and interact with visitors. Note that both virtual campus halls are always open to iLRN members and these fantastic immersive learning posters are still there for your perusal!  
  Indeed, the campus is crawling with network activity, as various initiatives sprout up in Teaching/Learning, UX/Design, and Research/Knowledge Sharing!  
  A few iLRN Frame VR Campus Highlights:  
   
  Summer '24, Doug Wilson invited his Learning, Design, and Technology students at George Mason University to meet regularly in our iLRN Student Center and explore the network co-designed FrameVR Campus. Dr. Wilson and iLRN campus staff offered the use of Frame VR's custom permissions to allow students an opportunity to pitch ideas, co-create and try out the campus' possibility spaces. > > > >  
   
  Wilson says, "FrameVR and the iLRN Student Center make great tools and provide quintessential presence to engage students on a range of topics in the instructional design space. A nimble system, graduate students swiftly got up to speed with FrameVR's easy to use tools and took part in compelling direct instruction as well as sensory experiences. Richter's presentation on the UN Sustainable Development Goals allowed students to align their creative design projects in XR with the iLRN conference theme Tech 4 Good; this introduced a high level of engagement for students who could then see their work from a global perspective and design with the greater good in mind. One student even chose to build a new virtual office for me in Frame VR as her design project! The authentic learning experiences possible in Frame VR and the iLRN Student Center underscored teaching and learning approaches illuminated in learning in activity (Engstrom, 2022), Community of Inquiry (Garrison , 2017) and situated learning (Lave & Wenger, 1991). Perhaps the most intriguing piece happened this fall at the Immersive Technology Conference on the George Mason University Arlington Campus. I setup a 60” flat screen connected to my MacBook Pro and invited students from as far away as Los Angeles to pop into Frame VR ILRN Student Center and interact live with the audience during my poster session. Student avatars in VR interacted live and face-to-face with people viewing on the big screen, a portal and intersection of the virtual and physical worlds! That was an engaging and unique experience and all with no headsets or goggles. FrameVR lowers the barriers to entry, and the global iLRN Student Center was the space! I can’t thank you and iLRN enough for making this all possible!  
  The Immersive Learning Research Network's campus is open to university member/partners in myriad different ways!  
  game jams or hackathons research talks independent student projects pedagogical or computer science design experiments international co-lab spaces In other campus activity, Randall Rode brought the EduCAUSE XR Community Group to the iLRN campus in August for exploration and discussion in the Circle of Scholars (CoS) amphitheater. Dr. Rode is presently supporting iLRN to co-develop our Community of Scholars in Immersive Learning, including public and members-only meetings in the CoS amphitheater.  
   
  > > > > > Bring YOUR immersive experience design group or team to the iLRN Campus for exploration or meeting!  
   
  Now that fall semester has arrived and universities are well underway with courses, the campus has picked up our activity and the iLRN Volunteers are more systematically managing our co-creations and other events on campus. They use our iLRN General Discord Server as a means of collaborating, working across time zones, skill sets, and campus design requests but they're ALWAYS doing something fun too and our twice-a-month meetings are always eye-opening and full of laughter and connections.  
  Lately, we've been working on turning a number of our campus buildings into our "HAUNTED VIRTUAL CAMPUS" - now in our 5th year!  
  (so I guess it's a tradition?). . . .  
   
  We're putting up some cryptic AI bots who speak of VR like a kooky steampunk character and grumpily invite you to check out other haunted spaces and leave them alone to their alarming experiments...  
   
  and finally, our lead iLRN Campus Volunteer Sarah Barker has been building a prototype Frame VR Research Library in our House 1, the "trunk" of our Knowledge Tree representing the BIG THREE disciplines that fundamentally contribute to hiqh quality Immersive Learning experiences: (1) Computer Science, (2) UX/Game Design and (3) The Learning Sciences. We are so excited of the possibilities of Sarah's contribution (check out her work on our Affiliate Partner's XR Women's Frame VR space!) and look to similarly build out 12 applied areas in Frames across our campus:
