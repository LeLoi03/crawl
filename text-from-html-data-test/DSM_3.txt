 DSM for Modeling and Analyzing Functionality: Views of Practitioners  Kilian Gericke    
 The paper presents an evaluation study for a DSM-based function modeling framework with practitioners in industry. Questionnaires and open discussion are used in a workshop format to obtain feedback on the framework's usefulness and practical applicability. It allows flexibly adaptive modeling multiple, interrelated views onto the functionality of (interdisciplinary) systems. The findings suggests a large potential for the framework to support cross-disciplinary design and for using the inherent matrices to do function analysis. The paper highlights the views of the practitioners on the strengths and potentials for further improvement.

 A DSM-based Framework for Integrated Function Modelling: Concept, Application and Evaluation  Kilian Gericke    
 Function modelling is proposed in literature from different disciplines, in interdisciplinary approaches, and used in practice with the intention of facilitating system conceptualisation. However, function models across disciplines are largely diverse addressing different function modelling perspectives and using different structures and forms for representing the contained information. This hampers the exchange of information between the models and poses particular challenges to joint modelling and shared comprehension between designers from different disciplines. This article proposes an integrated function modelling framework, which specifically aims at relating between the different function modelling perspectives prominently addressed in different disciplines. It uses interlinked matrices based on the concept of DSM and MDM in order to facilitate cross-disciplinary modelling and analysis of the functionality of a system. The article further presents the application of the frame...

 Measuring the potential of domain-specific modelling techniques  Jorn Bettin    
 2000  
 A small-scale example application is used to introduce a domain-specific notation for object- oriented user interfaces. This paper compares traditional software development (no abstract modelling), standard Unified Modelling Language (UML)-based software development, and software development based on domain-specific modelling. To allow a comparison, Lines of Code (LOC) serve as a measure of development effort, and Atomic Model Elements (AME) are
