  IEEE Global Internet (GI) Symposium  
   
 The 28 th  IEEE Global Internet (GI) Symposium 2023   
 Organized in conjunction with  
 IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications,  
 17-20 May 2023, New York area, USA  
  
 Paper submission at https://edas.info/N30394   
  
 The IEEE Global Internet (GI) Symposium is the flagship event established and organized by the Internet Technical Committee (ITC), a joint committee of the IEEE Communications Society (ComSoc) and the Internet Society (ISOC). The GI Symposium provides a top forum for researchers and practitioners to present and discuss advances in the current and future Internet and Internet-related technologies. The focus of the GI symposium is on experimental systems over the Internet and the design of future global Internet technologies, such as Information-Centric Networking (ICN), Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), network slicing, Artificial-Intelligence-based intelligent Internet, industrial Internet, and vehicular and drone networks, especially on a global Internet scale. The GI symposium also has a special focus on measurements-related aspects, besides the emerging technologies. In addition to the traditional research papers, we encourage papers with well-thought-through concepts and positions, papers that contrast proposed approaches, papers that clarify and compare inherent differences between competing technologies, and heresies.  
 The topics of interest for the GI 2023 include but are not limited to the following:  
 Routing, switching and addressing 
  Future Internet and next-generation network architectures 
  Information-centric networking, Software-defined networking, and network function virtualization 
  Wireless Internet and Internet technologies for 5G/6G 
  Datacenter network architectures and performance 
  Integration of in-network computation, cloud, and edge/fog computing 
  Next generation Internet applications in the cloud continuum 
  Machine learning, data mining, and big data analytics for intelligent Internet 
  Space-air-ground integrated network 
  Quantum Internet and quantum networking 
  Internet of Things, Machine-to-Machine, sensor, and vehicular/drone networks 
  Industrial Internet and time-sensitive and deterministic networks 
  Integrating blockchain with distributed Internet edges 
  Energy-efficient green communications 
  Geo-distributed applications, consistency, and latency challenges 
  Content delivery and management 
  Internet exchanges, remote peering, and peer-to-peer networks 
  Internet structure and analysis 
  Network-aware applications 
  Real-world Measurements and deployments 
  Distributed systems and novel distributed Internet applications 
  Online social networking 
  Internet measurement, modeling, and visualization 
  Large-scale network operations, management, and performance monitoring 
  Trust, security, privacy, and blockchain for the Internet 
  Anomaly, intrusion, and attack detection 
  Accountability, reliability, and resiliency for networks 
  Economic aspects of the Internet and network neutrality
