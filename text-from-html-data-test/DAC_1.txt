 The Global Event for Chips to Systems   

 I AM DAC  
   
 Exploring My Future at DAC  
 As a student passionate about electronic design and the semiconductor industry, I attend DAC to get a head start on my career. I am able to demonstrate my skills to design professionals and connect with mentors, recruiters, and future colleagues worldwide. I know that DAC can jumpstart careers by providing unparalleled networking and recruitment opportunities.  

 Research & Academia at DAC  
 My research drives innovation in the field and I'm here to showcase my work. DAC is the premier global design automation event, it assembles the ecosystem's foremost leaders, enabling us to spotlight breakthroughs pushing boundaries in the field. Presenting my research at DAC puts my work on the map, not just in the US but globally. DAC is not just about where we are today, it's about where the world will be tomorrow and far into the future.  

 Industry and Collaboration at DAC  
 As a design engineer in the electronic design ecosystem, I attend DAC to find the latest solutions and methodologies in AI, EDA, chip verification, design, and more. The technical program provides education for me and my colleagues, while the exhibits allow for firsthand interaction with vendors. The event is the perfect place to gain knowledge and network over four days. The DAC conference draws over 5,000 attendees that allows me to meet and collaborate with other designers in the ecosystem.  

 Exhibiting at DAC  
 As an exhibitor at DAC, I showcase my organization's software solutions and/or services to enable the next generation of chip design. More importantly, DAC gives us face to face time with our valuable customers and high-potential prospects from across the globe. It's the only yearly event that supports our business development objectives and my organization's goals.
