 IVAPP is part of VISIGRAPP    , the 18th International Joint Conference on Computer Vision, Imaging and Computer Graphics Theory and Applications.  
  Registration to IVAPP allows free access to all other VISIGRAPP conferences.      

  Although the conference is back to the normal mode (i.e., in-person) speakers are allowed to present remotely if unable to travel to the venue (hybrid support).    

 The International Conference on Information Visualization Theory and Applications aims at becoming a major point of contact between researchers, engineers and practitioners in Information Visualization. The conference will be structured along several topics mainly associated with Information and Data Visualization, but also with related fields such as Visual Analytics or Scientific Visualization.
