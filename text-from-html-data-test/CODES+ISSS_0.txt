 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis  

 CODES+ISSS: International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis  
 The International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS) is the premier event in system-level design, hardware/software co-design, modeling, analysis, and implementation of modern Embedded Systems, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), and Internet-of-Things (IoT), from system-level specification and optimization to system synthesis of multi-processor hardware/software implementations. The conference is a forum bringing together academic research and industrial practice for all aspects related to system-level and hardware/software co-design.
