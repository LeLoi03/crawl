 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Multimedia Signal and Vision Processing (IEEE CIMSIVP)  
  
 A better understanding of the computational principles underlying image, multimedia, signal and visual information processing, perception and cognition is one of the most fundamental challenges of contemporary science. Deeper insight into such principles may help us achieve more robust, faster, and more efficient intelligent systems. In particular, the fields of computer vision, and image and signal processing have tried to automate tasks that the human visual and auditory systems can do, with the aim of gaining a high-level understanding of images and videos. In this context, numerous algorithms have been successfully applied to a large number of real-world problems ranging from remote sensing to medical image analysis, video surveillance, human-robot interaction, and computer-aided design. This Symposium will address theory and applications of computational intelligence approaches in image, multimedia, signal and vision processing.  
 Scope and Topics  
 The proposed symposium aims to bring together new theories and applications of computational intelligence techniques to multimedia, computer vision, or image and signal processing problems. Computational intelligence paradigms include Fuzzy Systems, Deep and Shallow Neural Networks, and Evolutionary Computation, among other machine learning and nature inspired computing paradigms, like artificial immune systems or learning classifier systems. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 image segmentation 
  image registration 
  visual scene analysis 
  object detection and classification 
  object tracking 
  face detection and recognition 
  texture image analysis 
  3D shape reconstruction 
  pose estimation 
  gesture recognition 
  human behaviour understanding 
  biomedical image analysis 
  robot vision 
  multimedia technology and applications, including | joint processing of multimedia/multimodal signals/data 
  compression, storage, retrieval, networking, multi-modality devices/systems 
  theoretical approaches and modeling in low level vision and its relationship to biological machinery, among others.
