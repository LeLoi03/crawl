 EuroVA 2023  
 Workshop   
 EuroVA 2023 ( eurova.org/eurova-2023  ) is the fourteenth international EuroVis Workshop on Visual Analytics.  
 It will take place on Monday, June 12, 2023, in Leipzig, Germany, and is co-located with Eurovis 2023, the Eurographics Conference on Visualization ( eurovis.org  ).  
 Visual Analytics is a problem-solving and sense-making approach that integrates analytical computations, visual representations, and interaction. It includes the analysis of complex (massive, heterogeneous, dynamic, uncertain, …) data and information for gaining understanding, building knowledge, and inferring insight. Visual Analytics aims at a synergistic collaboration of humans and computers mediated through interactive visual interfaces. As such, Visual Analytics is an interdisciplinary field of research, including aspects of visualization, human-computer interaction, data science, statistics and mathematics, data management and knowledge representation, data analysis and machine learning, cognitive and perceptual sciences.  
 EuroVA 2023 is the premier workshop in Europe to present and discuss fresh ideas on new methods and theories, novel applications, designs, and studies on the use of Visual Analytics methods and systems. The workshop will accept a wide range of contributions within the broad area of Visual Analytics, including novel techniques, systems, applications, evaluation studies and methods, and theoretical foundations, as well as fresh viewpoints on future challenges and critical reflections.  
  EuroVA proceedings will be published in the EG Digital Library  . EuroVA is also indexed in dblp  and Scopus.
