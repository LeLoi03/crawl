 Welcome to EuroVis 2025   
   
 The 27th edition of EuroVis will take place in Luxembourg City, Luxembourg, and will be hosted by the Visualization and Interaction Group (VISINT) of the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST).   
 EuroVis is the premier annual conference organized by the Eurographics Working Group on Data Visualization  .  
 Since its inception in 1999 as a symposium, and its elevation to a full conference in 2012, EuroVis has grown to become one of the leading platforms for advancing visualization research and applications across Europe.  
 As a dynamic and rapidly evolving field, visualization plays a critical role in addressing one of today’s most pressing challenges: transforming vast amounts of raw data into meaningful insights. While data collection and storage capabilities have advanced exponentially, our capacity to derive actionable knowledge from this information lags behind. Visualization bridges this gap by utilizing the power of the human visual system, combined with advanced computer graphics, to offer intuitive exploration, analysis, and communication of complex data.  
 EuroVis 2025 aims to foster collaboration between visualization researchers and practitioners from across disciplines. The conference provides a unique platform for sharing groundbreaking research, building networks, and inspiring new research directions. With its broadened scope to encompass all areas of data visualization, EuroVis continues to expand its impact both within Europe and globally.  
 The main conference will be preceded by a series of co-located workshops and events, which will be held on June 2, 2025, at the same venue.  
 Join us for an enriching and inspiring experience in the heart of Luxembourg City!
