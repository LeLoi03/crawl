 Scope  
 The ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing is an international forum on the theory, design, analysis, implementation and application of distributed systems and networks. We solicit papers in all areas of distributed computing. Papers from all viewpoints, including theory, practice, and experimentation, are welcome. The goal of the conference is to improve understanding of the principles underlying distributed computing. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 biological distributed algorithms and systems 
  blockchain and decentralized finance protocols 
  coding and reliable communication 
  communication networks 
  combinatorics and topology of distributed computing 
  concurrency, synchronization, and persistence 
  design and analysis of distributed algorithms 
  distributed and cloud storage 
  distributed and concurrent data structures 
  distributed computation for large-scale data 
  distributed graph algorithms 
  distributed machine learning and artificial intelligence 
  distributed operating systems, middleware, databases 
  distributed resource management and scheduling 
  fault-tolerance, reliability, self-organization, and self-stabilization 
  game-theoretic approaches to distributed computing 
  high-performance, cluster, cloud and grid computing 
  internet applications 
  languages, verification, and formal methods for distributed systems 
  lower bounds and impossibility results for distributed computing 
  mobile computing and autonomous agents 
  multiprocessor and multi-core architectures and algorithms 
  peer-to-peer systems, overlay networks, and social networks 
  population protocols 
  quantum and optics based distributed algorithms 
  replication and consistency 
  security and cryptography in distributed computing 
  specifications and semantics 
  system-on-chip and network-on-chip architectures 
  transactional memory 
  wireless, sensor, mesh, and ad hoc networks
