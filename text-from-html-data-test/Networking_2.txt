 Counting Down to IFIP Networking 2023  
  The International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) Networking 2023 Conference will be held at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, in the beautiful city of Barcelona, Spain from 12-15 June 2023. This is the 22nd event of the series, sponsored by the IFIP Technical Committee on Communication Systems (TC6).   
 The main objective of Networking 2023 is to bring together members of the networking community, from both academia and industry, to discuss recent advances in the broad and quickly-evolving fields of computer and communication networks, to highlight key issues, identify trends, and develop a vision for future Internet technology, operation, and use.   
 The Conference includes three Workshops:   
 Impact of IT/OT Convergence on the Resilience of Critical Infrastructures (IOCRCI) 
  Security for IoT Networks and Devices in 6G (Sec4IoT) 
  3rd International Workshop on Time-Sensitive and Deterministic Networking (TENSOR) 2023, plus 
  a PhD Symposium: Symposium on Next-Generation Networks: AI, Architectures, Interfaces and Implementations
