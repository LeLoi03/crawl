 The purpose of VISIGRAPP is to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in both theoretical advances and applications of computer vision, computer graphics and information visualization. VISIGRAPP is composed of four co-located conferences, each specialized in at least one of the aforementioned main knowledge areas.  

  Although the conference is back to the normal mode (i.e., in-person) speakers are allowed to present remotely if unable to travel to the venue (hybrid support).
