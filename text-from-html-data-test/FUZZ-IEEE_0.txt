 Calling All Authors  
  
 The Annual IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems, well known as FUZZ-IEEE, is one of the premier international conferences in the field of fuzzy sets and systems. FUZZ-IEEE 2023 will be held in the Songdo International City which is a Free Economic Zone located approximately 15 minutes away by car from the Incheon International Airport and an hour from Seoul, making it a pleasant and convenient venue for business as well as for touring the Seoul metropolitan area. It is rising as one of the hottest places in Korea in terms of tourism, culture, leisure, MICE (Meeting, Incentive trip, Convention, Exhibition & Event), and shopping. This complex cultural space provides sharing of happiness to all visitors.
