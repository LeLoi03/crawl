 Mon 28 - Tue 29 April 2025 Ottawa, Ontario, Canada  SEAMS 2025  with ICSE 2025    
 Today we are building an exciting future in which autonomous vehicles navigate complex environments, smart cities help solve public problems and achieve a higher quality of life, and service robots support social care workers or perform tasks that are too dangerous for humans. However, these software-intensive systems must continuously preserve and optimize their operation in the presence of uncertain changes in ...

 Mon 23 - Tue 24 May 2022  SEAMS 2022  with ICSE 2022    
 Welcome to the website of the Symposium on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems 2022 conference, co-located with the 44th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2022). SEAMS 2022 Goes Virtual Considering the current evolving situation around the COVID-19 pandemic, and to provide some certainty to potential SEAMS participants, we have decided to make SEAMS 2022 a virtual- ... 
 Tue 18 - Fri 21 May 2021  SEAMS 2021  with ICSE 2021    
 SEAMS 2021 Goes Virtual The current trends in the global Covid-19 pandemic make it very unlikely that we will be able to hold a physical conference in Madrid in May 2021 with sufficient assurances of safety. Hence, it is with great sadness that​ we announce that SEAMS 2021, along with ICSE and other co-located events, will be held virtually this year. 
 Mon 29 June - Fri 3 July 2020  SEAMS 2020  with ICSE 2020

 Welcome to the website of the Symposium on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems 2019 conference. The objective of SEAMS is to bring together researchers and practitioners from diverse areas to investigate, discuss, and examine the fundamental principles, the state of the art, and critical challenges of engineering self-adaptive and self-managing systems. Modern and emerging software syste ... 
 Mon 28 - Tue 29 May 2018 Gothenburg, Sweden  SEAMS 2018  with * ICSE 2018 *    
 Modern and emerging software systems, such as industrial Internet of Things, Cyber-Physical Systems, cloud and mobile computing, have to operate without interruption. Self-adaptation and self-management enable these systems to adapt themselves at runtime to preserve and optimize their operation in the presence of uncertain changes in their operating environment, resource variability, new user needs, attacks, intr ...
