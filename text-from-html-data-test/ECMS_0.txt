 ECMS Conference Aims  
 The human capacity to abstract complex systems and phenomena into simplified models has played a critical role in the rapid evolution of our modern industrial processes and scientific research. As a science and an art, Modelling and Simulation have been one of the core enablers of this remarkable human trace, and have become a topic of great importance for researchers and practitioners. The increasing availability of massive computational resources, and interconnectivity has helped fuel tremendous advances in the field, collapsing previous barriers and redefining new horizons for its capabilities and applications.  
 The International ECMS Conference on Modelling and Simulation   is dedicated to help define the state of the art in the field. For several years, ECMS has proven to be an outstanding forum for researchers and practitioners from different fields involved in creating, defining and building innovative simulation systems, simulation and modelling tools and techniques, and novel applications for modelling and simulation.  
 In 2023 this conference is going to be organized by the University of Florence   June 20 – 23  
 The conference will address the following topics:  
 Supply Chain Management, Logistics and Transportation 
  Manufacturing Applications 
  Environment and Sustainability Applications 
  Gaming and Participatory Methods 
  Agent-Based Simulation 
  Hybrid Simulation 
  Simulation and Optimization 
  Complex, Intelligent, Adaptive and Autonomous Systems 
  Data Science for Simulation 
  Industry Case Studies / Commercial Case Studies 
  Modeling Methodology 
  Cyber-Physical Systems and Digital Twins 
  Finance and Economics and Social Science 
  Finite – Discrete – Element – Simulation 
  The conference will be co-located with these conferences:  
 ASMTA – EPEW – PASM
