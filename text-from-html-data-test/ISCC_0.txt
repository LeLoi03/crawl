 Welcome to the 28th IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications 2023   

 The first IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC) was held in 1995 in response to the growing interaction between the fields of computers and communications. ISCC takes place annually, usually in the Mediterranean region, in locations such as Egypt  , Cyprus  , Tunisia  , Portugal  , Morocco  , Italy  , Brazil  , Spain,  France  and Greece  . This year ( 2023  ), the 28th IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (IEEE ISCC 2023)  will be held in Tunis, Tunisia   by the summer, from the 9th  to the 12th of July  .  
 ISCC sessions will include presentations on new research results and tutorials. Papers describing original work are invited in any of the computer and communications areas that the Call for Papers  considers. Accepted papers will be included in the ISCC 2023 Conference Proceedings, which will be subject to independent peer-review procedures for quality, and may be eligible for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library  . Merit, relevance, and originality will guide paper acceptance. Best Paper Award and Best Student Paper Awards will be presented.  
 ISCC 2023, in its 28th edition, will provide an insight into the unique world stemming from the interaction between the fields of computers and communications.
