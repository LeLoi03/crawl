 Welcome to ISVC  
 COVID-19   Update:  Given that the current COVID-19 situation is relatively stable, we plan to hold the 19th International Symposium on Visual Computing (ISVC’24) in person  in Lake Tahoe, NV, October 21-23, 2024.  
    
 The purpose of the International Symposium on Visual Computing (ISVC) is to provide a common forum for researchers, scientists, engineers and practitioners throughout the world to present their latest research findings, ideas, developments and applications in visual computing. We seek papers describing contributions to the state of the art and state of the practice in the four central areas of visual computing: computer vision  , computer graphics  , virtual reality  , and visualization  . Of particular interest are papers that overlap with two or more areas.  
 ISVC will consist of invited and contributed presentations dealing with all aspects of visual computing. In addition to the main program, the symposium includes six keynote presentations, tutorials  , special tracks  , and a poster session. The symposium’s proceedings will be published by  Springer  in the  Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)  series. Information on abstracting and indexing of the LNCS series  can be found  here  .  A “best paper award ($500) will be sponsored by Springer this year  .   
 Authors of selected papers presented at ISVC’24 will be invited  to submit an extended  version of their work for expedited  review and possible publication in a special issue  on Advances in Visual Computing  in the Machine Vision and Applications   journal. The paper submission deadline is tentatively on March 15, 2025  with publication of the special issue expected within 2025.
