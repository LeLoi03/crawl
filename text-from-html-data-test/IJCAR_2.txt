 CALL FOR PAPERS  
  
 IJCAR 2024  
 The 12th International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning  
 Nancy, France  , July 1-6, 2024  
 https://ijcar2024.loria.fr/   
 =======================================================================  
 IJCAR is the premier international joint conference on all topics in automated reasoning.  
 IJCAR 2024 will be hosted by the Inria Nancy Research Center and LORIA in Nancy, France, from July 1-6, 2024.  
 IJCAR 2024 is the merger of leading events in automated reasoning:  
 * CADE (Conference on Automated Deduction)  
 * FroCoS (Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems)  
 * TABLEAUX (Conference on Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods)  
 TOPICS  
 ======  
 IJCAR 2024 invites submissions related to all aspects of automated or interactive logical reasoning, including foundations, implementations, and applications. Original research papers and descriptions/evaluations of working automated deduction systems or proof assistant systems are solicited.  
 IJCAR topics include the following:  
 * Logics of interest include: propositional, first-order, classical, equational, higher-order, non-classical, constructive, modal, temporal, many-valued, substructural, description, type theory.  
 * Methods of interest include: tableaux, sequent calculi, resolution, model-elimination, inverse method, paramodulation, term rewriting, induction, unification, constraint solving, decision procedures, model generation, model checking, semantic guidance, interactive theorem proving, logical frameworks, AI-related methods for deductive systems, proof presentation, automated theorem proving, combination of decision or proof procedures, SAT and SMT solving, machine learning and theorem proving, integration of automated provers/proof assistants in automated test generators, program synthesisers, verified compilers, intelligent systems, agent based systems, knowledge processing systems, formal methods tools and other symbolic tools, etc.  
 * Applications of interest include: verification, formal methods, program analysis and synthesis, computer mathematics, declarative programming, deductive databases, knowledge representation and processing/engineering, education, formalization of mathematics, trusted AI, etc.

 WORKSHOPS, TUTORIALS, SYSTEM COMPETITION  
 ==========================================  
 A two-day workshop and tutorial programme will be co-organized with the conference. In addition, the annual CADE ATP System Competition (CASC) will be held during the conference. Details will be published in separate calls and on the conference website.  
 SUBMISSION GUIDELINES  
 ======================  
 IJCAR 2024 invites submissions related to the topics of interest mentioned above.  
 All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another peer-reviewed journal or conference. The following paper categories are welcome:  
 Regular papers describing solid new research results. They can be  
 up to 15 pages in LNCS style, including figures but excluding references  
 and appendices. Where applicable, regular papers are supported by  
 experimental validation. Submissions reporting on case studies in an  
 industrial context are strongly invited as regular papers.  
 Short papers describing implemented systems, user experiences,  
 case studies and domain models, etc. They can be up to 7 pages in  
 LNCS style, excluding references and appendices.  
 All submissions will be judged on relevance, originality, significance, correctness, and readability. Proofs of theoretical results that do not fit in the page limit, executables of systems, and input data of experiments should be made available, e.g., via a reference to a website or in an appendix of the paper.  
 The review process will include a feedback/rebuttal period where authors will have the option to respond to reviewer comments. The PC chairs may solicit further reviews after the rebuttal period.  
 All submissions must be formatted using the Springer LNCS styles  and submitted in PDF via EasyChair:  
 https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ijcar2024  
 The IJCAR 2024 proceedings will be published in the Springer series Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI/LNCS) as Gold Open Access, and will be available online during the conference. All accepted papers must have one registration including the processing fees of the Gold Open Access (200 Euros per paper is foreseen, like for the previous edition of IJCAR). Authors of accepted papers are required to ensure that at least one of them will participate in the conference and present the work.  
 BEST PAPER AWARD  
 ================  
 IJCAR 2024 will recognize the most outstanding submissions with a best paper award and a best student paper award at the conference.  
 STUDENT TRAVEL AWARDS  
 =====================  
 Woody Bledsoe Travel Awards will be available to support selected students in attending the conference.
