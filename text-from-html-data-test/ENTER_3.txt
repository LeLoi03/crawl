 The Initial Impact of Technology Enabled Relationship Creation in Rural Lebanon  
  Technology enables actor-to-actor experience co-creation leading to value creation for the parties involved in the process. This research presents the initial impact of a mobile application developed to foster technology enabled relationship in rural Lebanon. Results indicate that technology has the potential to positively impact both host and guest fostering relationships building in all the trip stages and leading to socio-economic development and transformative experiences. In fact, the paper shows that relationships created and strengthened with the support of technology are expected to have effects at personal, community and business level.

 Meaning of Fun in Hotel Gamified Applications  
  The hospitality industry faces significant challenges from the acceleration of travelers using mobile technology, especially in the Covid-19 aftermath. Consumer behaviour is changing in the service sector, creating new forms of mobilities and types of tourists. Users are taking advantage of the opportunity to access information easier and faster, anywhere causing new promotional strategies for hospitality businesses. However, it is recognized that the adoption of mobile applications does not guarantee competitive advantage. This research is inspired by the success of mobile games, and the importance of delivering fun. It explores hotel visitors’ meaning of ‘fun’ when using a mobile hotel gamified application. This is to give mobile gamified application developers an indication on the fun elements that would make such a technology engaging with the users. Visual materials were used applying game mechanics and aesthetics in a hotel application helping participants understand how the fun elements are incorporated so they can focus/target on the elements they find more attractive.

 Riding Against the Algorithm: Algorithmic Management in On-Demand Food Delivery  
  In many countries, on-demand food delivery platforms (e.g. Deliveroo, Wolt, Uber Eats) have become an inseparable part of the hospitality and tourism ecosystem. A key area of interest in technology research has been how platforms algorithmically manage the interaction between task requesters (e.g. customers, tourists) and task fulfillers (e.g. restaurants and delivery couriers). However, there is a lack of research on how such algorithmic management practices impact workers and what strategies workers adopt to counteract the algorithm. To that end, this qualitative study explores forms of expressing algoactivism in the context of on-demand food delivery platforms by conducting interviews with delivery couriers (n = 5) and restaurant workers and managers (n = 7). It is found that both couriers and hospitality employees adopt specific behaviors to optimize and game the platforms’ algorithms, and that some algorithmic management practices are perceived more negatively than others. Implications for e-tourism management and research are discussed.

 “Domestic or International?” The Impact of Cognitive Absorption of Short-Form Videos on Tourists’ Post-COVID Travel Intention: An Exploratory Study on Douyin  
  The extant studies have attested to the effects of media experiences in shaping destination image and influencing the behavioral intentions of potential tourists. However, limited works have focused on the impact of holistic experiences during the interaction with destination-related short-form videos on potential tourists’ negative emotional responses and post-COVID travel intention. This study aims to elucidate how cognitive absorption affects tourists’ travel anxiety and post-pandemic travel intention in different travel settings (domestic versus international). The comparative results show that users’ cognitive absorption when interacting with destination-related short-form videos can effectively influence the behavioral intentions of potential tourists. The result also identified that travel anxiety significantly contributes to higher post-COVID travel intention. This study expands cognitive absorption research in the contexts of tourism and short-form videos, offers an angle for future studies to positively interpret tourists’ travel anxiety, and provides tourism practitioners with suggestions on the tourism industry's recovery in the post-COVID era.

 A Re-rank Algorithm for Online Hotel Search  
  Recommender Systems were created to support users in situations of information overload. However, users are consciously or unconsciously influenced by several factors in their decision-making. We analysed a historical dataset from a meta-search booking platform with the aim of exploring how these factors influence user choices in the context of online hotel search and booking. Specifically, we focused our study on the influence of (i) ranking position, (ii) number of reviews, (iii) average ratings and (iv) price when analysing users’ click behaviour. Our results confirmed conventional wisdom that position and price were the “two elephants in the room” heavily influencing user decision-making. Thus, they need to be taken into account when, for instance, trying to learn user preferences from clickstream data. Using the results coming from this analysis, we performed an online A/B test on this meta-search booking platform comparing the current policy with a price-based re-rank policy. Our online experiments suggested that, although in offline experiments items with lower prices tend to have a higher Click-Through Rate, in an online context a price-based re-rank was only capable to improve the Click-Through Rate metric for the first positions of the recommended lists.

 Exploring Customer Experience with Service Robots in Hospitality and Tourism: Activity Theory Perspective  
  Addressing a call for theoretical development in human-robot interaction research, this study introduces activity theory to the field of service robots (SRs) in hospitality and tourism. Activity theory was used as the foundation for the conceptual analysis of in-depth interviews with hospitality customers. The results of content analysis of the interviews and future research directions are presented based on each of the service activity system’s components: object (customer experience (CE) with SRs in a hospitality unit), subject (customers), technology (SRs), rules (implementation procedures of SRs), community (customers, other customers, and employees), division of labor (a division of service), outcome (satisfaction, overall experience with hospitality establishments, and behavioral intentions), and context. The study provides future research directions in using activity theory in studies on human-robot interaction and CE with SRs in hospitality and tourism. Robot developers and hospitality professionals can use the data analysis framework proposed in this study to evaluate CE with SRs.

 How Do Affect the Infusion of Smart Technology and Mindfulness of Tourism SMEs on Competitiveness?  
  The purpose of this research is to analyse the effect of the infusion of smart technologies and the mindfulness of tourism small and medium-sized organisations (SMEs) in the use of smart technologies on several aspects related to the companies and their employees. Specifically, its effect on service advantage, value co-creation, employee job satisfaction, employees’ perception of service cannibalisation and competitiveness of tourism companies is analyzed. The total sample obtained was 877 employees/managers of tourism SMEs located in Europe and the United States. The model proposed in the study was estimated with PLS-SEM, a variance-based structural equation modeling statistical technique. The results of the study offer important implications and recommendations to researchers in the tourism field, tourism organisations and destinations on the importance of using smart technologies.

 User Experience and Spatial Presence in a Walk-In Augmented Reality 3D Model for Tourists  
  In the context of vulnerable tourist attractions, it is often the case that tourists cannot be allowed the enter all the premises of the attraction, which potentially has a negative impact on the visitors’ experience. Virtual reality technologies are available for presenting the attraction for tourists in these cases, but the use of augmented reality (AR) also seems to have a role in certain use cases. The current paper presents our first experiment of using a walk-in augmented reality model to present an attraction to visitors near the original attraction. The tourist attraction visualized using AR was Mannerheim’s Saloon Car dating back to World War II. Nine participants used a tablet-based AR application to examine a realistically sized three-dimensional (3D) model of the saloon car in the close vicinity of the actual tourist attraction and filled in a questionnaire, which probed their user experience, spatial situation model, and spatial presence when using the system. These early results suggested that viewing a 3D model of the attraction using tablet-based AR provided a positive user experience for the participants and that the tablet-based AR implementation was successful in supporting the participants’ formation of a spatial situation model of the saloon car. The participants also gave relatively high ratings for spatial presence while viewing the 3D model using tablet-based AR.

 Spatial Spillover Effects of the Digital Economy on Tourism Demand: Evidence from China  
  Despite widespread concerns about the effect of the digital economy on productivity, few studies have examined the relationship between the digital economy and tourism demand. Based on 285 China’s prefectural-level city statistical data and big data from 2011 to 2019, a comprehensive index of the digital economy is developed and a spatial econometric model is employed to investigate such relationship. The result shows that the growth of the digital economy has positive spatial spillover effects on tourism demand, contributing to extending the impact of the digital economy on tourism demand from the spatial perspective and providing insights for policymakers on regional cooperation in the digitalisation context.

 Mobile Eye-Tracking as a Research Method to Explore the D/Deaf Experience at Arts and Cultural Venues  
  D/deaf activists have consistently lamented their exclusion from the decision-making process by service providers. Accessibility is only effective when designed with contributions from those affected by the perceived or known barrier. This paper redresses the historic absence of the D/deaf paradigm, and recenters the focus to the individual’s perspective of accessibility requirements by developing a conceptual framework, constructed through the review of empirical and theoretical literature. The conceptual dimensions presented are from the D/deaf person’s perspective as valued through shared power and ownership. The aim of this conceptual paper is to explore how D/deaf-centric research can be applied and qualitatively measured through the combination of self-report, observation and Mobile eye tracking (MET).

 The Effect of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) and Cryptocurrency Use on Changes in the Transaction Utility of International Tourists  
  This study investigates how exposure to local prices changes the transaction utility of international tourists, and the role of purchasing power parity (PPP) and the use of cryptocurrency in these changes. Findings indicate that tourists’ transaction utility did not vary all that much when they visited a country with comparable PPP to their own. Meanwhile, when traveling to countries with a lower PPP, tourists enjoy a heightened transaction utility. Furthermore, using Bitcoin results in greater transaction utility than using fiat currency.

 Daily Deals Usage in the Pandemic Context of the Slovenian Hotels: Technology Adoption Perspective  
  This paper analyses the usage of Daily Deals (DDs) in the COVID-19 pandemic context. A constructivist approach and grounded theory methodology are applied to study the managerial DDs usage in Slovenian hotels. The results show a predominance of organisational and external environmental factors, such as government regulation, linking structures, and industry characteristics, on the usage of DDs. These are shown in a conceptual DDs usage model. The study contributes to the hotel digital marketing literature by merging the two leading technology adoption frameworks to explain the formation of attitude and usage of DDs in a specific pandemic context.

 Factors Influencing Users’ Content Sharing Intention in Travel-Related Consumer Generated Media  
  Travel-related consumer generated media (CGM) plays an increasingly important role in travelers’ decision-making process. Strenuous effort has been dedicated to explore CGM’s impact on users’ travel behaviors. However, little is known about the motivations that drive users to post information on travel-related CGM. By combining the technology acceptance model (TAM), theory of planned behavior (TPB), and uses and gratifications theory (U&G), this study aims to delve into such motivational factors. The results revealed that users’ perceived ease of use when posting content significantly affects perceived usefulness. Additionally, users’ gratification derived from entertainment, information sharing, and rewards could positively influence their attitudes toward content sharing. Moreover, attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and perceived usefulness jointly determine users’ intention to use travel-related CGM for content sharing. However, the impacts of perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, status-seeking, socializing, and passing time on their attitudes toward content sharing were insignificant. This study tests the possibility of combining the TAM, TPB, and U&G to expand their application in the field of travel-related CGM, and provides suggestions for travel-related CGM managers to improve their services.

 Exploring the Possibility of Short-Form Travel Videos for Cross-Border Promotion in Rural Tourism During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Study of Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, China  
  The impacts of short-form travel videos (STVs) on destination marketing have been widely acknowledged in recent years. Although there have been many prior studies on short video platforms, the mechanism and research system of the impacts of travel contents in short-form videos on users are not clear. This study aims to reveal the possibilities of STVs in cross-border tourism promotion and to develop research models and survey methods applicable to research related to the contents of STVs. Therefore, a scenario-based experiment was designed using STVs related to Ganzi (甘孜) destination. The findings (N = 456) highlighted that users’ attitudes towards STVs have a direct impact on destination image and travel intention, while users’ emotional resonance (self-reference, sense of presence) and cognitive resonance (perceived esthetics, credibility, and entertainment) jointly determine users’ attitudes towards STVs. With the application of stimulus-organism-response (SOR) theory as a basic framework, this study explains the influence mechanism of STVs. The possibility of cross-border promotion and destination image building in impoverished areas was explored using a scenario-based experiment.

 Can TikTok Sound Enhance Tourism SMEs’ Engagement?  
  This study explores the role of sound and its interaction with marketer-generated content (MGC) (i.e., emotional, informational, transactional) in influencing customer engagement (CE) (i.e., views and shares) in the context of tourism SMEs and TikTok. Content analysis was conducted to analyze data from 7 travel guide services in Indonesia. The final dataset comprised 660 TikTok videos, 4,092,289 views, and 10,920 shares. The results confirm that cover sound has no direct effect either on views or shares. Also, cover sound has no interaction effects with any MGC in impacting CE (i.e., views and shares). Individually, the MGC of emotional content has significant and positive effects on views, while informational and transactional posts have no significant effects on views. Further, transactional social media posts have significant and positive effects on shares, while informational and emotional posts have no significant effects on shares. Theoretically, this study expands content marketing and tourism CE literature by investigating factors driving CE in the context of tourism SMEs and TikTok. Practically, findings from this research can assist tourism SMEs in optimizing their content marketing strategies on TikTok.

 Visual Social Media Communication of Italian Luxury Hotels and the Pandemic: An AI-Assisted Content Analysis  
  This study analyses the visual social media communication of Italian 5-star hotel brands to investigate whether it has changed over the course of COVID-19. An AI-based image content analysis approach was used to extract the most frequently ascribed labels from 2,439 collected photos of three consecutive year samples. The results of the performed content analysis show that the visual communication of the hotel brand is mainly focused on interior design and the natural environment, with the pandemic stimulating the use of the latter. The study contributes the literature by reinforcing the importance of relative consistency in luxury brand communication even in turbulent times.

 What Makes People So Fond of Food Travel Vlogs? A Preliminary Study  
  The large consumption of food travel vlogs during the COVID-19 pandemic shows its potential for destination promotion. However, little research has been done on this video form. This study explores the difference in food travel vlogs, short videos, live videos, and DMO promotion videos (DPVs) and concludes four distinctive characteristics of food travel vlogs (storytelling, authenticity, intimacy, and presence) through 38 semi-structured interviews. A Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) model-based conceptual framework is proposed to help understand the mechanism underlying the influence of food travel vlogs on travellers. This study hopes to provide theoretical and practical implications for destination management and vlogging practices.

 Smart and Sustainable Destination Experiences: A Content Analysis on Finnish Tourism Experts’ Perspectives  
  This paper discusses how Finnish tourism experts such as tourism entrepreneurs, destination management organizations (DMOs), development project personnel, and third-party organizations explain and shape the smartness of tourism destinations in Finland. We especially explore how the experts view the nexus of smartness and the experiences of tourists. The method used in this research is qualitative inductive content analysis. The preliminary findings show that the destinations aim to provide sustainable experiences with a balance between physical and digital services. However, the conditions such as scant mobility services and sometimes harsh nature conditions set challenges to developing smart tourism experiences. Smartness is still seen as a way to improve different aspects of social, cultural, and ecological sustainability.

 Where You Sleep Tells What You Care About  
  Online reviews are valuable sources of information that can help other tourists gain an idea of the destination they seek. The aim of this research is to examine what types of content is reviewed by hotel guests and Airbnb guests in two of the main urban tourist cities in Spain (Barcelona and Madrid) to distinguish content between the destination where the accommodation is located and to observe variations on users of these platforms when they write reviews. Comparing more than one million reviews posted on TripAdvisor and Airbnb through compositional data analysis (CoDa), results show that there are different patterns between Barcelona and Madrid and between their accommodation mode according to the reviews. This study can help researchers and managers know what useful information can be extracted from online travel reviews.

 Social Media-Based Tourist Flow Weighting  
  The identification of tourism flows is of great importance for the tourism industry to design memorable experiences. Since Millions of smartphone users are sharing their routes on online social networks (OSNs), social media analytics (SMA) based on location-based social networks (LBSNs) became a powerful tool to analyze tourism flows. Thus, this paper proposes a novel analytical approach to investigate tourism flows based on geotagged social media data through the weighted inclusion of comments and likes.

 Contribution of Network Approach to Tourism Destination Governance  
  A tourism destination is a prototypical complex phenomenon and an ideal object of study of network science. Thanks to recent advances in computer science, this approach is capable of providing the baseline needed to design and govern tourism destinations in a dynamic environment. Although there have been some major contributions to this phenomenon, their scarcity has brought a rather fragmented contribution to tourism destination governance. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to conceptualise the contribution of network approach to tourism destination governance. Based on 10 real and virtual networks of mature tourism destinations in a Central Europe, the article provides areas where the network approach can help the tourism destination governance. Furthermore, it suggests managerial implications from the application of the network approach in the practice of governing a tourism destination.

 Boundaries of Visitors’ Willingness to Disclose Personal Information to Tourism Destinations  
  With the rising demand for personal information, touristic websites and service providers collect and increasingly depend on the willingness of tourists’ private data disclosure. While legislation slowly provides directions for data collection practices, tourists remain wary on which and how much data they should or have to provide to organize their visit in a tourism destination. Our qualitative study explores this domain holistically and lays out four boundary evaluations: blurred, but clear view, positive incentives, subjective well-being, and restraining factors on how tourists evaluate their willingness to disclose personal information to a destination. By drawing upon and substantiating theory of information privacy behavior, we contribute to the field of personal information sharing in the tourism domain by expanding and coloring the complexities of tourists’ expectations, intentions, and boundaries.

 How Do Destinations Relate to One Another? A Study of Destination Visual Branding on Instagram  
  Destination marketers are aware that online communication about their destination is increasingly dependent on visual media rather than text, due to the growing popularity of social networks such as Instagram. An accurate understanding of how the destination is being presented to users in this medium is critical for digital marketing activities, e.g. to know if the desired destination brand is present or if visitors focus on other aspects of the destination than those being promoted in marketing. Unlike text mining, which has well established techniques to extract keywords and associations from text corpora, a consistent approach to understanding the content of images and expressing the resulting destination brand is lacking. This paper presents a visual classifier trained and fine-tuned specifically for destination brand measurement from images using 18 visual classes. It presents an exploratory study of how different destinations are being presented visually on Instagram and discusses how these insights could be used by destination marketers to adapt and improve their digital marketing.

 Exploring Post-COVID-19 Branding Strategies of African Destinations  
  The lifting of COVID-19 restrictions has led to the opening of many tourism destinations, with many destination marketing organizations (DMOs) adopting different strategies to attract tourists. This study explores the post-COVID-19 branding strategies of four award-winning African destinations (South Africa, Kenya, Morocco, and Mauritius) and how they utilize social media to communicate their destination brand identities. We curated the tweets of the National Tourism Boards of the examined destinations from their official Twitter accounts and analyzed them using Atlas.ti. We found that each of the destinations uniquely identifies and communicates its destination’s competitive advantages. We provide insights and implications.

 Estimating Tourist Arrivals by User Generated Content Volume in Periods of Extraordinary Demand Fluctuations  
  In extraordinary situations, like the Covid-19 pandemic, irregular demand fluctuations can hardly be predicted by traditional forecasting approaches. Even the current extent of decline of demand is typically unknown since tourism statistics are only available with a time delay. This study presents an approach to benefit from user generated content (UGC) in form of online reviews from TripAdvisor as input to estimate current tourism demand in near real-time. The approach builds on an additive time series component model and linear regression to estimate tourist arrivals. Results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms a traditional seasonal naïve forecasting approach when applied to a period of extraordinary demand fluctuations caused by a crisis, like Covid-19. The approach further enables a real-time monitoring of tourism demand and the benchmarking of tourism business in times of extraordinary demand fluctuations.

 A Scoping Study of Ethics in Artificial Intelligence Research in Tourism and Hospitality  
  As e-tourism scholars advance innovative research on the use and study of artificially intelligent systems, it is important to reflect on how well we are advancing transformative philosophies which ask that emerging fields consider issues of ethics, power, and bias. We conduct a scoping study of review papers published between 2015–2021 to understand the extent to which ethical and social bias issues are identified and treated in AI research in tourism. Results suggest that the potential for ethical and bias issues in AI in tourism is high, but identification and treatment of these issues by tourism researchers is weak. We summarize key implications of this trend and offer suggestions for pursuing a research agenda which increasingly identifies and treats issues of ethics and bias when advancing research on artificial intelligence (AI) in tourism.

 Tourist Flow Simulation in GAMA Using Historical Data Parameters  
  Decision makers in the tourism sector deal with various issues and need high-quality information to support their decisions. We propose a data-centric approach that analyses historical point of interest (POI) check-in data to determine parameters for an Agent Based Model (ABM). ABM simulation is then run multiple times to simulate possible outcomes in terms of the tourist flow. We have tested the proposed approach on the city of Salzburg using check-in data from Salzburg Card users across 29 POIs. These data were used to parameterize the ABM model with the number of people, the number of POIs a person visits per day, and the preference for selecting POIs to visit. The simulation was performed in GAMA ABM platform and the spatial environment was based on buildings and roads from OpenStreetMap (OSM). Simulation for the duration of 1 day has been repeated 50 times to generate POI visiting patterns. The simulation results have been compared to the ground truth data for the same day and they show that the approach can recreate the long-term pattern of POI visits, but has over-estimated several POIs that had lower visitor counts on that specific day.

 Comparing Marketing and Computer-Based Methods for Evaluating Online Reviews  
  This short paper aims to compare humanities and computer-based online review analysis methods. In particular, we evaluate two classical methodologies coming from marketing and natural language processing fields. We assessed them through their ability to translate online reviews into synthetic evaluations reflecting consumers’ overall feelings. Both methods were run in separate ways, then we confronted the results.

 Towards Recommender Systems in Augmented Reality for Tourism  
  Recent advances in augmented reality have enabled new ways of generating and presenting item recommendations. In tourism, AR applications can, for example, enhance points of interests (POIs) with virtual elements in AR and provide tourists with personalized recommendations for places to visit. In this paper, we present our prototype: a touristic AR application that augments various POIs with digital content and generates context-aware recommendations for POIs in the Niederdorf old town of Zurich, Switzerland. We demonstrate how useful information can be presented to users in an engaging way by combining AR technologies and recommender systems.

 Gamification and Innovation Acceptance Among Finnish DMOs - Case King’s Road  
  According to Xu, Buhalis & Weber [1], gamification can enhance the on-site tourist experiences and be a marketing tool. However, the use of games in tourism development by DMOs is still an unexplored topic.The King’s Road in Finland combines the idea of gamified and storified live experiences with a video game. The development idea of a video game introduces King’s Road to a broader audience. The idea of a storified mobile game leads tourists on-site and rebuilds historical sites with augmented reality while leading tourists to less crowded attractions.This paper aims to provide new insights and increase understanding of gamification in tourism. To understand the innovation acceptance among Finnish DMOs, the gamified concept idea of King’s Road was presented to them. With the inductive approach, their feedback was analysed thematically. The findings highlight the obstacles and possibilities of the proposed gamification concept from the DMOs’ point of view. This paper aims to extend the previous research in innovation acceptance by identifying the level of acceptance regarding gamification in this case study and presenting solutions to advance it. Hence, this knowledge works as a basis for future research and development.

 Never-Ending Tourism: Tourism Experience Scenarios for 2030  
  The advent of recent technological advancements, and particularly, the metaverse, has brought unprecedented opportunities for tourism. The integration of multiple realities extends tourism beyond the traditional chronological classification of pre-travel, during-travel, and post-travel stages. The novel concept of never-ending tourism captures a holistic multi-dimensional experience in which technological solutions are at the foundation to elevate tourism to an on-going, never-ending activity that permeates every day and travel life. This study adopted a futures methods approach through qualitative in-depth interviews and a scenario development supported by a storytelling technique. The findings present three distinct scenarios of never-ending tourism on a spectrum of digital companion, digital escape and digital connection. The scenarios suggest a growing importance of the pre-travel and post-travel phases, while technologies continue support visitors to enjoy the irreplaceable multisensory experiences on site. Towards 2030, the metaverse will enable visitors to mentally teleport themselves to destinations, regardless of time, financial resources and physical abilities. Individuals will seamlessly move between integrated digital and physical realities, where the engagement with travel becomes a part of daily life. The study is novel and original in that it empirically explores the emerging concept of never-ending tourism and contributes to the wider metaverse discourse in the tourism context. Several practical suggestions and future research directions are given to unlock the potential of never-ending tourism in relation to integrated experience design, new business models and long-term customer engagement.

 Metaverse and Tourism: From a New Niche to a Transformation  
  Metaverse is named among the technologies that are predicted to transform everyday life. The proliferation of such technologies as the Internet and smartphones has triggered major transformations in the tourism industry. This paper conceptualises the phenomenon of Metaverse towards the phenomenon of tourism. It applies a semi-systematic literature review methodology to identify existing alignment between the phenomena. The paper concludes that there is a conceptual alignment between the critical dimensions of the Metaverse and tourism. Tourism should be ready for the reciprocal effects of metaverse development on tourism and vice versa, from new opportunities to enhance tourist experience to a possible dissolution of the contemporary understanding of tourism.

 Back in Time with Immersive Heritage Tourism Experience: A Study of Virtual Reality in Archaeological Sites  
  This study focuses on how virtual reality applications might evoke nostalgic sensations in travellers during cultural heritage tourism. While extensive research on the tourism experience has revealed different extrinsic and intrinsic dynamics that affect the tourist experience, this research aims to explore what feeling of back in time VR users experience in an archaeological destination. The gap in visitor experience employing VR research still persists, despite the rising adoption rate of immersive technology, such as virtual reality. In this study, a qualitative method has been applied to analyse online reviews of VR users who visited the Olympia Archaeological Site in Greece and used the ‘Back in Time Olympia’ VR application. The findings drawn from the results show that nostalgia, presence, engagement by learning, and service experience are essential determinants of tourist VR experiences in such cultural heritage destinations.

 Marketing Tourism Products in Virtual Reality: Moderating Effect of Product Complexity  
  As the tourism industry faces growing competition and digital transformation in the post-pandemic era, virtual reality has emerged as a creative marketing strategy. However, investing in virtual reality may be costly. Evaluating what type of products can generate higher returns through virtual reality is critical. Our study explored the moderating effect of product complexity on the relationship between virtual reality characteristics and behavioral intention. Our results indicated that the relationship between telepresence and consumer trust is stronger for a complex tourism product than a simple product. Firms with limited resources should invest in virtual reality to market complex products.

 Legal Considerations on the Relationship Between Tourism Marketing and AR  
  Augmented reality (AR) is greatly changing the tourism scene in this decade. With the recent expansion of AR, it is now possible to obtain digital flyers and coupons by physically visiting a place. Various AR-based games, such as Pokémon Go, have encouraged many people to visit various locations in the real world. However, the use of AR as a marketing strategy to attract customers and induce movements in humans has created new legal issues, such as the appropriateness of placing coupons on private properties and its use in public parks by private companies for sales promotions. In addition, since AR can make valuable digital information appear in a space for a specific period, it raises new issues regarding time management. This paper considers the problems that arise in guiding people using AR, mainly from a legal perspective, and discusses the future direction.

 Talking Houses: Transforming Touristic Buildings into Intelligent Characters in Augmented Reality  
  Augmented reality (AR) technologies can enhance the user’s experience of visiting attractions, shops, and restaurants by using AR-based virtual elements and additional information about the places they are visiting. In this work, we transform the city landscape or iconic buildings into a unique experience by bringing iconic characters onto the buildings to increase users’ engagement. Our techniques transform buildings or parts of a building into a virtual character with which the user can interact. We designed two unique experiences: (a) ‘The Square’ in which the character will talk about the building’s history and other anecdotes about the area, and (b) ‘The Hunt’ in which the user is involved in a scavenger hunt where they have to identify buildings using the hints given by virtual characters. We have conducted a live user study to assess our prototype’s usability. Our preliminary experimental results demonstrated that our prototype has high usability and users using our system felt a pleasant and enjoyable experience.

 What Makes Potential Tourists Trust the Managerial Response of the Hotel? - The Three-Way Interaction of Ability, Benevolence, and Integrity  
  Potential customers are likely to rely on online reviews as e-WOM. While review from negative consumer has an impact on customers’ decision-making, the response of hotel to negative review is also perceived as a signal of restoring trust. Although three dimensions of trust (ability, benevolence, and integrity) have significant effects on the overall trust of consumers, it is still an open issue how the three variables interact. To fill this gap, current study investigates a three-way interaction effect of the dimension of trusting belief in managerial responses by experimental analyses. The results suggest that the hotel’s ability to handle the issue is the most important consideration for hotel management. Attitude toward hotels is high even if only one of benevolence and integrity is high under conditions of high ability. In contrast, attitude is only high when both other dimensions are high simultaneously. This study has implications for understanding the distinct effect of each dimension of trusting belief in online review systems and providing insights into effective managerial response strategies from the perspective of trust.

 Assessing Turnover Intentions of Algorithmically Managed Hospitality Workers  
  Employee turnover has been one of the main concerns facing the hospitality industry. This issue seems to be aggravated in artificial intelligence (AI) environment, where AI implementation is associated with pressure, job alienation, and labor replacement, increasing workers’ desire to quit their job. To analyze the relationship between AI awareness, job alienation, discrimination, and turnover intention, an online survey was distributed to hospitality employees (n = 450). From a series of independent-samples T-tests and regression analyses, this study found employees’ turnover intentions are significantly associated with employees’ concerns of being replaced by AI, perception of job alienation, and workplace discrimination. Importantly, current algorithmically managed workers tend to feel more powerless and discriminated against, and thus have higher turnover intentions. Recommendations for practice and future research are provided.

 Agent-Based Modelling for Sustainable Tourism  
  Agent-based modelling (ABM) is a computer-based system to simulate the interactions, relationships and behavior of individual agents in a defined spatial context. Due to its stochastic and heterogenic nature, the method has the potential to represent the complexity of the tourism system with a broad range of possible applications. In the context of visitor flow management for instance, ABM can function as a possible decision support tool for policy makers to better understand and evaluate the dynamics of future scenarios and proposed policy changes towards a more economically, socially and environmentally resilient tourism development altogether. The following paper discusses the potential and implications of agent-based models in tourism research with a complex system approach in regard to ABM’s inherent elements of agents, interactions and environment. It introduces the planned application of ABM in an ongoing project dealing with visitor flows in an urban as well as rural destination context and draws up possible implications for sustainable tourism development.

 Older Adults’ Perceptions of Digital Cultural Tourism in ‘Super-Aged’ Nations: The Case of Finland and Japan  
  Older adults have been recognized as a key tourist segment for cultural tourism. Despite the growing population of older adults, limited research have explored their experiences and needs within digital cultural experiences. Therefore, this research note takes on an exploratory approach in understanding older adults’ perceptions towards digital cultural experiences in the context of two ‘super-aged’ nations: Finland and Japan. The findings illustrate that differences do exist, and that Finnish older adults are found to be more open to technology-use in the context of digital cultural experiences than their Japanese counterparts. Implications for e-tourism research and management are discussed.
