 IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symposium  

 Next symposia:  
 The | 38th IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symposium | will be held in Santa Cruz, California, USA. 
    
 The Computer Security Foundations Symposium (CSF) is an annual symposium for researchers in computer security and privacy, to develop and examine theories of security and privacy, to build the formal models that provide a context for those theories, and to study techniques for verifying, analyzing, and implementing security and privacy. It was created in 1988 as a workshop of the IEEE Computer Society's Technical Committee on Security and Privacy  , in response to a 1986 essay by Don Good entitled The Foundations of Computer Security—We Need Some  . The meeting became a “symposium” in 2007, along with a policy for open, increased attendance. Over the past two decades, many seminal papers and techniques have been presented first at CSF. All topics relating to foundational security and privacy are in scope.
