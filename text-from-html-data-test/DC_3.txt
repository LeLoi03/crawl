 The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative Conference (DCMI or DC)  or the International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata Applications, formerly the Dublin Core Metadata Workshop and the Metadata Workshop, is the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative’s annual conference and meeting. The conference gathers experts from various areas in the private and public sectors, including the library world, the networking and digital library research communities, corporate knowledge management, e-government and public sector information.  
 Initially organized as a series of invitational workshops with a main focus at the definition and finalization of the Dublin Core metadata standards, this has developed into an annual get-together of people involved in the work of DCMI and other metadata activities. Since 2001, the event includes a Tutorial track, a peer-reviewed Conference track, Special Sessions and Working Group meetings.
