 About EMAS  
 The workshop on Engineering Multi-Agent Systems  was formed as a merger of three existing workshops:  
 Agent Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) 
  Declarative Agent Languages and Technologies (DALT) 
  Programming Multiagent Systems (ProMAS) 
  EMAS was founded in 2012 at the Dagstuhl  seminar “Engineering Multi-Agent Systems”  , which most of the Steering Committee members of the three former workshops were attending.  
 Steering Committee  
 EMAS was originally overseen by a merged steering committee from the three parent  workshops, which then expanded:
