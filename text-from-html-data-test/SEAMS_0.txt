 18th Symposium on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems  
   
 Today we are building an exciting future in which autonomous vehicles navigate complex environments, smart cities help solve public problems and achieve a higher quality of life, and service robots support social care workers or perform tasks that are too dangerous for humans. However, these software-intensive systems must continuously preserve and optimize their operation in the presence of uncertain changes in their operating environment, resource variability, evolving user needs, attacks and faults. In addition, the complexity of these systems demands them to adapt and manage themselves autonomously.  
 SEAMS is a CORE-A ranked conference that applies software engineering methods, techniques, processes, and tools to support the construction of safe, performant, and cost-effective self-adaptive and autonomous systems that provide self-* properties like self-configuration, self-healing, self-optimization, and self-protection. The objective of SEAMS is to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to investigate, discuss, examine, and advance the fundamental principles, state of the art, and the solutions addressing critical challenges of engineering self-adaptive and self-managing systems.  
 For more information, please visit the research track  and the artifact track  sites.  
 NEW:   SEAMS 2023 will use two submission rounds for the Research Track, with firm deadlines in October 2022  and February 2023  , and with the possibility of submitting a revised version from the first round to the second as detailed below.

 In Memoriam: Valérie Issarny  

 It is with great sadness that we say goodbye to Valérie Issarny, an esteemed scientist and colleague. The SEAMS community expresses its deep appreciation for Valérie’s efforts as Co-Program Chair of SEAMS 2023. Valerie fought her disease with extraordinary courage until her last moment and we admired her strength. We will sincerely miss her and we are very grateful to Valérie for her many contributions to our community and the middleware and distributed systems communities.
