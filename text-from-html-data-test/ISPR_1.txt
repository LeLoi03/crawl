  Call: “The Natural World in the Cinema” for Aniki: Portuguese Journal of the Moving Image | Published:   
 August 30, 2023 | Call for Papers The Natural World in the Cinema Special section of Aniki: Portuguese Journal of the Moving Image https://aim.org.pt/ojs/index.php/revista/announcement/view/67 Submission deadline: January 15, 2024 This special section of Aniki aims to map the relationship between cinema and what we call ‘the natural world’, recognizing the human as a mediating element of this articulation, while responding and reacting to the tendency towards anthropocentrism that is found in both film production and the plurality of critical approaches canonized in the context of film studies. It will promote a broad discussion of this problem without any specific focus on a time period,… | Read more : Call: “The Natural World in the Cinema” for Aniki: Portuguese Journal of the Moving Image 
  Real cows, not CGI’d versions, are stars of this 3D illusions billboard campaign in UK | Published:   
 August 30, 2023 | [Arguably another step toward more effective presence illusions, a new 3D billboard campaign for the UK retail chain Marks & Spencer features live action, ‘in camera’ images rather than computer-generated ones. For context, coverage in DesignTAXI notes that “If there’s an emerging trend in the world of out-of-home advertisements, it’s 3D billboards. Previously, Subway allowed passers-by to design their very own sandwiches in real-time, while Adidas celebrated Lionel Messi’s World Cup victory with a giant display.” Creative Review adds ”The 3D billboard is definitely having a moment, with brands using the format to sell everything from movies to trainers (see… | Read more : Real cows, not CGI’d versions, are stars of this 3D illusions billboard campaign in UK

  Study: Want to eat less candy? Watching repeated immersive videos of someone else consuming it could help | Published:   
 August 29, 2023 | [A new study published in Nature’s Scientific Reports finds that watching repeated immersive, first-person 360 videos of a person eating M&Ms, especially if the viewing is accompanied by chocolate scents, may evoke a sense of presence and cause habituation that leads to decreased craving and eating of the candy (but note that presence itself wasn’t measured and no comparison with a less immersive media experience was included). The Nanyang Technological University (NTU) press release below includes many of the details and lots of quotes from the researchers; the link to the open-access article in Scientific Reports is at the end.… | Read more : Study: Want to eat less candy?

  Medium-as-social-actor presence: If AI becomes conscious, how will we know? | Published:   
 August 28, 2023 | [For decades now the misperception that a computer is a human-like social actor rather than just a technology following its programming has been considered an illusion. And until recently it seemed clear that the perception of an AI as more than a technology was too. But as this story from Science reports, as technology evolves the distinctions become less clear. Scholars across disciplines are now developing methods and measures to help us separate effective mimicry that evokes medium-as-social-actor presence, from machines that have actually attained consciousness. Even defining the key terms is challenging (e.g., consciousness is not the same as… | Read more : Medium-as-social-actor presence: If AI becomes conscious, how will we know?

  Scream therapy: The benefits of immersive horror | Published:   
 August 24, 2023 | [This story from Psychology Today describes potential psychological benefits of immersive horror experiences that combine “live actors, intricate sets, physical effects like heat and cold, and psychological ‘tricks’ to help induce fear.” As the author is careful to note, these intense experiences aren’t recommended for or appealing to everyone (!). See the original version for a second image. –Matthew] [Image: Credit: Mathias Verduyckt / Quietus Horror] Scream Therapy: The Benefits of Immersive Horror The unexpected mental health benefits of facing fear through immersive horror.
