 Welcome to PAKDD2023  

 The Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD) is one of the longest established and leading international conferences in the areas of data mining and knowledge discovery.  
  It provides an international forum for researchers and industry practitioners to share their new ideas, original research results, and practical development experiences from all KDD related areas, including data mining, data warehousing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, databases, statistics, knowledge engineering, visualization, decision-making systems, and the emerging applications.  
 The 27th edition of PAKDD will be held in Osaka, Japan, from May 25 to May 28, 2023.  
 The venue will be a hybrid of onsite and online.  
 Japan plans to downgrade COVID-19 on May 8 to the same category as common infectious diseases such as seasonal influenza.  
 We will monitor the situation and inform you of any changes in the conference organization.
