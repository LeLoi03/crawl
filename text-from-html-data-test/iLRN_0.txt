  About iLRN 2023   
 The 9th International Conference of the Immersive Learning Research Network (iLRN 2023) will be an innovative and interactive gathering for a flourishing global network of researchers and practitioners collaborating to develop the scientific, technical, and applied potential of immersive learning. It is the premier scholarly event focusing on advances in the use of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), and other extended reality (XR) technologies to support learners across the full span of learning—from K-12 through higher education to work-based, informal, and lifelong learning contexts.   
  
  Following two years of innovative fully online and in-VR conferences, this year’s conference will offer a hybrid experience with three days of presentations and activities on the iLRN Virtual Campus, powered by VirBELA, followed by four days on location in San Luis Obispo, CA, USA. Scholars and professionals working from informal and formal education settings as well as those representing diverse industry sectors are invited to participate in the conference, where they may share their research findings, experiences, and insights; network and establish partnerships to envision and shape the future of XR and immersive technologies for learning; and contribute to the emerging scholarly knowledge base on how these technologies can be used to create experiences that educate, engage, and excite learners.
