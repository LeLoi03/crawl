Paper Submission Guidelines  
  
  The yearly asilomar conference on signals, systems, and computers provides a forum for presenting recent and novel work in various areas of theoretical and applied signal processing. Initial submissions for conference participation must include a 100–200 word abstract an extended summary (500–1000 words plus figures), the title of the paper, each author's name and affiliation, technical area, and topic designation from the call for papers.  
 Final conference papers are reports of the conference presentation and are due after the conference. The IEEE is a technical co-sponsor and post-conference final papers are required to adhere to IEEE publication standards.  As such, final papers should be limited to the work presented during the conference. Methods and material contained should be described in sufficient details to permit evaluation and replication. Toward that goal, final conference papers are expected to include the following elements:  
 Abstract 
  Introduction 
  Proposed method 
  Experimental data and results 
  Conclusion 
  Acknowledgement
