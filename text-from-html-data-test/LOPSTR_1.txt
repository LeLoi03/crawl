 LOPSTR was founded by Kung-Kiu Lau  in 1991. It has taken place annually since.  
 The next LOPSTR symposium, LOPSTR 2024  , will be held in Milan (Italy) in September 9-11, 2024.  
 Its original title was International Workshop on Logic Program Synthesis and Transformation  , and the workshop was intended to focus on logic programs. The title was changed to International Workshop on Logic-based Program Synthesis and Transformation  in 1998 to reflect a widening of its scope. It was changed to International Symposium on Logic-based Program Synthesis and Transformation  in 2002.  
 Currently, the aim of the LOPSTR series is to stimulate and promote international research and collaboration on logic-based program development. LOPSTR is open to contributions in logic-based program development in any language paradigm.  
 LOPSTR has a reputation for being a lively, friendly forum for presenting and discussing work in progress.  
   LOPSTR is usually co-located with PPDP ( International ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming  ).  
 You can find here  the old LOPSTR website maintained by Kung-Kiu Lau  .  

 Topics of interest cover all aspects of logic-based program development, all stages of the software life cycle, and issues of both programming-in-the-small and programming-in-the-large, including, but not limited to:  
 synthesis 
  transformation 
  specialization 
  composition 
  optimization 
  inversion 
  specification 
  analysis and verification 
  testing and certification 
  program and model manipulation 
  AI-methods for program development 
  verification and testing of AI-based systems 
  logic-based methods for security, cyber-physical and distributed systems 
  transformational techniques in software engineering 
  applications, tools and industrial practice 
  Survey papers that present some aspects of the above topics from a new perspective, and application papers that describe experience with industrial applications are also welcome.
