 The conference will take place at the Vila Galé Porto hotel.  
 Located in the heart of Porto, a ten-minute walk from the famous shopping street of Rua de Santa Catarina, the Vila Galé Porto hotel was built in 1999 and renovated in 2015. The metro station Campo 24 de Agosto is located just 100 meters from the hotel and it allows you easy and quick access to anywhere in the city and to the airport.  
 Having cinema as its inspiration, this unit’s common areas are decorated with pictures that recall iconic movie scenes, renowned directors or the most talented actors.
