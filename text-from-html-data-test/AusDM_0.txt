 Welcome to AusDM 2023  

 The Australasian Data Science and Machine Learning Conference formerly known as the  Australasian Data Mining Conference has established itself as the premier Australasian meeting for both practitioners and researchers in data mining. It is devoted to the art and science of intelligent analysis of (usually big) data sets for meaningful (and previously unknown) insights. This conference will enable the sharing and learning of research and progress in the local context and new breakthroughs in data mining algorithms and their applications across all industries.  
 Since AusDM’02 the conference has showcased research in data mining, providing a forum for presenting and discussing the latest research and developments. Built on this tradition, AusDM’23 will facilitate the cross-disciplinary exchange of ideas, experience and potential research directions. Speciﬁcally, the conference seeks to showcase: Research Prototypes; Industry Case Studies; Practical Analytics Technology; and Research Student Projects. AusDM’23 will be a meeting place for pushing forward the frontiers of data mining in academia and industry. The theme of the conference this year is Data Science and Machine Learning: Now part of everyone everyday  .  

 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Statement:    

 AusDM’23 promotes an inclusive environment and encourages the open expression and exchange of ideas, free from all forms of discrimination, retaliation, and harassment. AusDM’23 is committed to empowering diverse, equitable, and inclusive participation.
