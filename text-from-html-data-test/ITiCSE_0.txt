 ITiCSE 2023 (10 – 12 July)  
   Welcome to the 28th annual ACM  conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE). ITiCSE conference is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Computing Education (SIGCSE)  , in collaboration with the ACM Europe Council  , and Informatics Europe  . ITiCSE 2023 will take place in Turku, Finland, and it is hosted by University of Turku (UTU)  .  
 Destination: Turku, Finland   
 Turku, located in Southwest Finland, is a European city of culture where the fresh sea breeze, the breath of history and modern bustle meet. Founded almost 800 years ago, Turku is the oldest city of Finland and the former capital of the country. Turku has witnessed both the launch of reformation and the birth of the nation’s written language. Notably, at regular intervals until 1827 the city burnt to the ground and had to be rebuilt. The country’s first university was founded in Turku in 1640.  
 Today, Turku is a city of about 200,000 inhabitants. The city is known for its maritime and pharmaceutical industries, vibrant harbor, large archipelago, marvelous Gothic cathedral, medieval castle, and large student population. The city is officially bilingual, meaning that about 5% of the population speaks Swedish as their native language. Tervetuloa! Välkommen! Welcome!
