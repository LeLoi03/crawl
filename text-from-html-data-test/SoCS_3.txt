 The Seventeenth International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS 2024) from June 6-8, 2024 in Kananaskis, Alberta, Canada. The symposium co-chairs were Ariel Felner and Jiaoyang Li.  
 The International Symposium on Combinatorial Search is meant to bring researchers in such areas together to exchange ideas and cross-fertilize the field. SoCS serves researchers and submissions in all fields that use combinatorial search, including artificial intelligence, planning, robotics, constraint programming, meta-reasoning, operations research, navigation, and bioinformatics. Papers exploring the boundaries between combinatorial search and planning & scheduling research are particularly welcome, given the co-location with the 2024 International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS 2024). The papers included in this issue have been organized into three categories — technical papers, position papers, and extended abstracts.

 The Thirteenth International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS 2020) was conducted as an entirely online symposium from May 26-28 2020. The symposium cochairs were Daniel Harabor and Mauro Vallati. The spread of the COVID-19 disease, and the current international conditions forced cancellation of the original venue for the symposium in Vienna, Austria.

  The 2019 SoCS program included 27 technical talks in five streaming sessions, and two keynotes. For the first time ever the symposium featured an entire day of Master Class sessions, where recognized experts told us about recent developments in search. A community forum with dedicated threads for every talk was established. There was also a Discord server for live text/voice/video interaction.

 The Eleven Annual Symposium on Combinatorial was held Stockholmsmässan (Stockholm International Fairs) in Stockholm, Sweden, from July 14–15, 2018. The symposium cochairs were Vadim Bulitko and Sabine Storandt. The proceedings were published by AAAI Press.  
 The objective of SoCS is to network researchers working in the area of combinatorial search. This area is important to several research communities, including artificial intelligence in general and auto- mated planning, operations research, and robotics in particular. SoCS is thus a meeting attended by ex- perts of different subfields, providing an excellent opportunity to foster collaboration, and to boost cross-fertilization among these subfields. This year, SoCS was part of the Federated AI Meeting (FAIM) which also included the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence and the European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-ECAI), the International Conference on Au- tonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS), the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) and the International Conference on Case-Based Reasoning (ICCBR). SoCS sessions running in parallel with workshops and tutorials of other conferences as well as joint coffee breaks allowed the attendees to exchange ideas.  
 The program committee accepted 25 of the 46 full paper submissions (54.3 percent acceptance rate) and both extended abstracts.

SoCS is thus a venue attended by experts of different subfields, providing an excellent opportunity to exchange ideas, foster collaboration, and boost cross-fertilization among these subfields. In 2016, the program committee accepted 13 of the 34 long original submissions (38.2 percent acceptance rate), and 6 of the 9 short original submissions (66.6 percent acceptance rate). Following the tradition from previous years, among the rejected long submissions, PC members helped identify a subset of papers that described novel research and that was deemed as showing significant potential. The SoCS 2016 symposium was colocated with the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), held immediately after SoCS, in the city of New York.

 The Eighth Annual Symposium on Combinatorial was held in Ein Gedi, Israel, from June 11–13, 2015. The symposium cochairs were Levi H. S. Lelis and Roni Stern. The proceedings were published by AAAI Press.  
 Heuristic search and other forms of combinatorial search optimization are active areas of research in artificial intelligence, robotics, planning and other areas of computer science. SoCS brings together researchers from such areas to exchange ideas and cross- fertilize the field. To bring in new ideas, every year SoCS features a special scope on a related research area. In 2015, SoCS’s special focus was applying metareasoning to combinatorial search. In addition to exciting talks on metareasoning, SoCS featured a special panel on this topic. SoCS 2015 was held in cooperation with AAAI and collocated with the International Conference on Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS) 2015).

 The Seventh Annual Symposium on Combinatorial was held in Prague, Czech Republic, from August 15–17, 2014. The symposium cochairs were Stefan Edelkamp and Roman Barták. The proceedings were published by AAAI Press.  
 Heuristic search and other forms of combinatorial search are currently very active areas of research in artificial intelligence, planning, robotics, constraint programming, operations research, bioinformatics, and other areas of computer science. SoCS is meant to bring researchers from these areas together to exchange their ideas and cross-fertilize the field. To bring in new ideas, every year SoCS features a special scope on a related research area. Previous SoCS events have provided a special focus on automated planning (2010), search in robotics (2011), grid-based path planning (2012), and algorithm engineering (2013). In 2014, SoCS specifically invited submissions from researchers in the big data community and related areas that work on large search problems. This special scope on big data has not been a clear success, but attracted a smaller number of stronger submissions outside the traditional AI search communities. SoCS 2014 was held in cooperation with AAAI and collocated with the European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2014)

To bring in new ideas, every year SoCS features a special scope on a related research area. This year, SoCS specifically invited submissions from researchers in the algorithm engineering community and related areas that work on graph search problems and other combinatorial search problems. This special scope on graph search engineering has been a clear success, attracting a considerable number of strong submissions outside the traditional AI search communities.  
 The 2013 proceedings contains 23 full papers and 4 research abstracts of original work, and 6 summaries of previously published work.

 Heuristic search and other forms of combinatorial search optimizations are currently very active areas of research in artificial intelligence, robotics, planning, and other areas of computer science. The International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS) is meant to bring researchers in such areas together to exchange ideas and cross traditional academic boundaries. SoCS-2010 is the third event in this series. A special scope this year is on the relationship between search in domain-independent planning and domain-specific search. For SoCS-2010 we also invited participation from the algorithmics community to share their recent successes in path planning in road networks.  
 This was an important year for SoCS as archival proceedings were established for the first time. These proceedings are the result of hard work by many, from researchers to reviewers and the publisher.  
 This volume contains all of the papers from the symposium held 8–10 July, 2010 at Stone Mountain near Atlanta, Georgia USA. The program includes 17 oral paper presentations, 6 poster papers, 2 position papers, and and 7 short summaries of papers presented at other conferences.
