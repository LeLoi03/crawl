 TACAS  
 TACAS is a forum for researchers, developers and users interested in rigorously based tools and algorithms for the construction and analysis of systems. The conference aims to bridge the gaps between different communities with this common interest and to support them in their quest to improve the utility, reliability, flexibility and efficiency of tools and algorithms for building systems.  
 The TACAS conference is a founding member of ETAPS  . Its roots go back to 1995, when it was first held in Aalborg, Denmark. Since then the TACAS proceedings  are published in the LNCS series of Springer-Verlag.
