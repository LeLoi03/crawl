 Constraints - An International Journal, 2011  
 The areas of planning and scheduling (from the Artificial Intelligence point of view) have seen important advances thanks to application of constraint satisfaction techniques. Currently, many important real-world problems require efficient constraint handling for planning, scheduling and resource allocation to competing goal activities over time in the presence of complex state-dependent constraints. Solutions to these problems require integration of resource
