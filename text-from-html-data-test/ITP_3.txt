   Conference Call for Papers  
 The ITP conference series is dedicated to interactive theorem proving and related topics, ranging from theoretical foundations to implementation aspects and applications in program verification, security, and formalization of mathematics. The inaugural meeting of ITP was held on 11 to 14 July 2010 in Edinburgh, Scotland, as part of the Federated Logic Conference (FLoC, 9 to 21 July 2010). ITP is the evolution of the TPHOLs conference series to the broad field of interactive theorem proving. TPHOLs meetings took place every year from 1988 until 2009.  

 Overview  
 Top Research Topics at Interactive Theorem Proving?  
 Programming language (42.94%) 
  HOL (28.53%) 
  Proof assistant (26.76%) 
  The aim of the conference is to expand the discussion of research in Programming language, HOL, Proof assistant, Theoretical computer science and Mathematical proof. Topics in Programming language explored in the conference were investigated in conjunction with research in Gas meter prover and Code (cryptography). While HOL is the focus of Interactive Theorem Proving, it also provided insights into the studies of Type (model theory), Separation logic, Higher-order logic, Code generation and Algorithm.  
 Interactive Theorem Proving addresses concerns in Proof assistant which are intertwined with other disciplines, such as Rewriting, Set (abstract data type), Type theory and Calculus. In it, Probabilistic logic, Correctness, Soundness and Data structure are investigated in conjunction with one another to address concerns in Theoretical computer science research. Discrete mathematics and Development (topology) are some topics wherein Mathematical proof research discussed in the event have an impact.  
 The main emphasis of it is the research on Automated theorem proving, emphasizing the topic of ACL2. The main emphasis of Interactive Theorem Proving is the subject of Algebra, focusing on Algebraic number.  
 What are the most cited papers published at the conference?  
 A machine-checked proof of the odd order theorem (201 citations) 
  Nitpick: a counterexample generator for higher-order logic based on a relational model finder (200 citations) 
  A trustworthy monadic formalization of the ARMv7 instruction set architecture (114 citations) 
  Research areas of the most cited articles at Interactive Theorem Proving:  
 The conference papers primarily tackle Programming language, HOL, Theoretical computer science, Proof assistant and Mathematical proof. Programming language study tackled in the most cited articles is connected to the field of Development (topology). The conference papers address concerns in HOL which are intertwined with other disciplines, such as Refinement calculus, Type (model theory), Code (cryptography), Haskell and Algorithm.  
 What topics the last edition of the conference is best known for?  
 Programming language 
  Algorithm 
  Algebra 
  The previous edition focused in particular on these issues:  
 The conference mainly deals with areas of study such as Programming language, HOL, Theoretical computer science, Discrete mathematics and Proof assistant. Some problems in Programming language that were presented in Interactive Theorem Proving overlapped with concepts under Scalability and De Bruijn sequence. The conference holds forums on HOL that merges themes from other disciplines such as Automated theorem proving, Mathematical analysis, Hierarchy (mathematics), Code generation and Data structure.  
 Issues in Theoretical computer science were discussed, taking into consideration concepts from other disciplines like Mathematical proof, Correctness and Implementation. The research on Discrete mathematics tackled can also make contributions to studies in the areas of Development (topology) and Combinatorics. The studies in Proof assistant featured incorporate elements of Height function, Process calculus, Constant (computer programming) and Set (abstract data type).  
 The most cited articles from the last conference are:  
 Foundational Property-Based Testing (37 citations) 
  Refinement to Imperative/HOL (33 citations) 
  Autosubst: Reasoning with de Bruijn Terms and Parallel Substitutions (29 citations) 
  Papers citation over time  
 A key indicator for each conference is its effectiveness in reaching other researchers with the papers published at that venue.  
 The chart below presents the interquartile range (first quartile 25%, median 50% and third quartile 75%) of the number of citations of articles over time.

 Publication chance based on affiliation  
 The publication chance index shows the ratio of articles published by the best research institutions at the conference edition to all articles published within that conference. The best research institutions were selected based on the largest number of articles published during all editions of the conference.  
 The chart below presents the percentage ratio of articles from top institutions (based on their ranking of total papers).Top affiliations were grouped by their rank into the following tiers: top 1-10, top 11-20, top 21-50, and top 51+. Only articles with a recognized affiliation are considered.  

 Research.com  

 During the most recent 2015 edition, 0.00%  of publications had an unrecognized affiliation. Out of the publications with recognized affiliations, 70.97%  were posted by at least one author from the top 10 institutions publishing at the conference. Another 0.00%  included authors affiliated with research institutions from the top 11-20 affiliations. Institutions from the 21-50 range included 19.35%  of all publications and 9.68%  were from other institutions.  
 Returning Authors Index  
 A very common phenomenon observed among researchers publishing scientific articles is the intentional selection of conferences they have already attended in the past. In particular, it is worth analyzing the case when the authors participate in the same conference from year to year.  
 The Returning Authors Index presented below illustrates the ratio of authors who participated in both a given as well as the previous edition of the conference in relation to all participants in a given year.

 The experience to innovation index  
 Our experience to innovation index was created to show a cross-section of the experience level of authors publishing at a conference. The index includes the authors publishing at the last edition of a conference  , grouped by total number of publications throughout their academic career (P) and the total number of citations of these publications ever received (C).  
 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups:  
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25), 
  Competent - P < 10 or C < 100 (the number of publications less than 10 or the number of citations less than 100), 
  Experienced - P < 25 or C < 625 (the number of publications less than 25 or the number of citations less than 625), 
  Master - P < 50 or C < 2500 (the number of publications less than 50 or the number of citations less than 2500), 
  Star - P ≥ 50 and C ≥ 2500 (both the number of publications greater than 50 and the number of citations greater than 2500). 

 The chart below illustrates experience levels of first authors in cases of publications with multiple authors.
