 The Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI)  is an international event which concentrates on AI theories, technologies and their applications in the areas of social and economic importance for countries in the Pacific Rim. It aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, educators and users in AI and related communities for in-depth intellectual exchanges, research cooperation and professional development.  
 From 1990 to 2016 PRICAI conferences were held biennially in even-number years. In 2018 PRICAI became an annual event.  
 Topics:  
  Big data analytics,  
  Data mining and knowledge discovery, Information retrieval and extraction, Knowledge acquisition and ontology, Knowledge management, Knowledge representation, Machine learning, Natural language processing, Neural networks and deep learning, Reasoning, Text/Web/Internet mining, Semantic Web, Social intelligence  
 Recurring “Knowledge” Workshops:  
 Principle and practice of data and Knowledge Acquisition Workshop (PKAW)* | The Principle and practice of data and Knowledge Acquisition Workshop (PKAW), until 2019 the Pacific Rim Knowledge Acquisition Workshop (PKAW), provides a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss the state-of-the-art in the areas of knowledge acquisition and machine intelligence (MI, also Artificial Intelligence, AI) | The first workshop in the Pacific Rim series of Knowledge Aqcuisition Workshops was the Japanese Knowledge Acquisition for Knowledge-Based Systems Workshop (JKAW) in 1990 followed by the Australian Knowledge Acquisition for Knowledge-Based Systems Workshop (AKAW) in 1991. JKAW was organized biennially until 1994, AKAW irregularly until 1999. The first time the workshop was labeled as PKAW was in 1996. Since 2002 PKAW is a regular part of PRICAI. | PKAW was also known as International Workshop on Knowledge Management and Acquisition for Intelligent Systems (PKAW 2012, 2014) / Smart Systems and Services (PKAW 2010) 
  “Knowledge Management” Workshops & Tutorials:  
 2020: 8th Artificial Intelligence for Knowledge Management (AI4KM) | The objective of this multidisciplinary session is to gather both researchers and practitioners to discuss experiences in various AI approaches and techniques applied to knowledge management and innovation. It includes methodological, technical and organizational aspects of AI used for knowledge management and feedback from KM applications using AI. Among the topics to address are: knowledge management methods, models, decision support systems, management advisors, virtual training, serious games, applications of machine learning to support innovation and eco-innovation, knowledge visualization for improving the creativity and human-machine interfaces, image mining making links between data and images ex bio-detection are good examples of multidisciplinary applications as well as knowledge management applied to global security and sustainability. 
  2000: Tutorial: The role of Artificial Intelligence in Knowledge Management | Knowledge Management (KM) is an emerging field rapidly gaining momentum both in the research arena and the business community. This tutorial begins with a review of the dominant trends in the development of Corporate Knowledge Management by linking recent work to the background of researchers. A number of AI areas/techniques are finding their way as strong enablers of KM. Most noticeably, Intelligent Agents, Information Filtering and Ontologies. Common KM applications will be described and these include, among others, knowledge maps and corporate memories in product development, software re-use, business processes and knowledge communities. Challenges and predictions for KM will also be outlined. This tutorial is especially suited to practitioners and researchers who want to learn about the field of KM and the major contributions of AI research and applications to this new field.
