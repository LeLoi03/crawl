 Does every Computer Scientist need to know Formal Methods?  
   2024-10-02  ·   
  curricula  · fme teaching committee  · fmtea    

 FME’s Teaching Committee  has recently organised a special issue of Formal Aspects of Computing  that puts forward different perspectives on why and how Formal Methods should be represented in Computer Science curricula. The discussion was triggered by the guidelines that ACM has been publishing for computer technology university curricula for more than five decades  .

 Cliff B. Jones: Understanding Programming Languages   
 Springer, November 2020, 229 pp, ISBN: 978-3-030-59256-1. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59257-8   
 Summary  
 The book Understanding Programming Languages  by Cliff B. Jones is about the formal specification of the semantics of programming languages. It focuses on the structural operational semantics of imperative and sequential languages, including features such as blocks and procedures, with an extension to concurrent objects at the end of the book. The material is presented with great clarity and requires almost no background knowledge, making the book perfectly suitable for any person curious about programming languages and seeking a deeper understanding of how they work. This book is also for language designers, as being formally precise is an invaluable tool to help catch design issues early in the design phase.
