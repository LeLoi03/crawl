  Call For Papers   
   
 New computing paradigms, such as cloud computing, big data and the Internet of Things open new horizons to businesses by making possible the provision of high quality services all over the world. All these developments ultimately aim at improving our quality of life, at making it easier to generate wealth, and at ensuring that businesses remain competitive in the global marketplace. These developments have been made possible in a remarkably short time span, by virtue of the fact that information and communication technologies move fast; sometimes they move too fast for society and for governments. This explains why such rapid technological evolutions cannot be problem-free. In the domain of digital businesses, concerns are raised regarding the lack of trust in electronic procedures and the extent to which information security and user privacy can be ensured. In answer to these concerns, the 19th International Conference on Trust, Privacy and Security in Digital Business (TrustBus 2022) will provide an international forum for researchers and practitioners to exchange information regarding advancements in the state of the art and practice of trust and privacy in digital business. TrustBus 2022 will bring together researchers from different disciplines, developers, and users all interested in the critical success factors of digital business systems. We are interested in papers, work-in-progress reports, and industrial experiences describing advances in all areas of digital business applications related to trust and privacy, including, but not limited to: Anonymity and pseudonymity Common practices, legal and regulatory issues in digital business Delivery technologies and scheduling protocols Economics of information systems security and privacy Enterprise management and consumer protection Intellectual property and digital rights management Languages for description of services and contracts Models for access control and authentication Cryptographic building-blocks for e-business applications Business architectures and underlying infrastructures Design of business models with security requirements Electronic cash, wallets and pay-per-view systems Security, privacy and trust in e-services Cloud computing security and privacy Identity management, identity theft and trust management Information audit and trust Trust and reputation in digital business environments Security and privacy in cyber physical systems Methodologies for privacy by design and by default Methodologies for privacy impact assessment Privacy and Security Patterns Security and privacy governance and management Intrusion detection and information filtering Online transaction processing PKI & PMI Security of P2P transactions and scenarios Security, privacy and trust in real-time Internet e-Services Reliability and security of content and data Reputation in services provision Secure process integration and management Reliable auction, e-procurement and negotiation technology Transactional Models Security, privacy and trust in mobile commerce environments Usability of security and privacy technologies and services Security and privacy models for pervasive information systems Shopping, trading, and contract management tools Security and privacy policies Multi-factor authentication schemes Accountability, Transparency and Intervenability Security and privacy in big data processing Security and privacy of mobile applications  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2022-01-26
