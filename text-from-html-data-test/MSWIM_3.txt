MSWiM'23 RISING STAR Award    

  The RISING STAR Researcher Award  
 The MSWIM main Conference has initiated the RISING STAR award in 2019 to be given each year to a YOUNG researcher at the early stage of his/her career (within the first 5 years of their academic career) in recognition of his/her exceptional scientific contributions to the field of wireless communication and networking, and mobile systems. The candidate must have a reasonable set of publications accepted MSWiM Conference. The selection committee is composed by the Steering Committee, as well as the MSWiM General and Technical Program Chairs of current year. The award is presented to the winner at the Conference Banquet for that specific year.
