 Life-long friendships  

 ENTER as a conference singlehandedly developed the global eTourism community and provided the birthplace for many innovations that have transformed the international tourism world. IFITT engages the community and supports a range of events, activities, scholarships and plays a leading role in global engagement to address key challenges in the tourism and technology sphere.   
  
 Prof. Dimitrios Buhalis  , Bournemouth University, Poole, UK    

 IFITT and ENTER have been, and are, an incredible environment for the evolution of the whole eTourism field and for my personal development as a scholar. Besides that, it is a wonderful community in which discussions, collaborations, chats and friendships develop almost spontaneously and with great value for all those who are involved   
  
 Prof. Rodolfo Baggio  , Bocconi University, Milan, Italy
