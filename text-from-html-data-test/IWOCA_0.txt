 About IWOCA  
 Since its inception in 1989 as AWOCA (Australasian Workshop on Combinatorial Algorithms), IWOCA has provided an annual forum for researchers who design algorithms for the myriad combinatorial problems that underlie computer applications in science, engineering and business. Previous IWOCA and AWOCA meetings have been held in Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, UK, and USA. Previous IWOCAs can be found at http://www.iwoca.org/   
 IWOCA 2023 will take place in the Magic School of Green Technologies in National Cheng Kung University   , Tainan, Taiwan. Tainan is located in the South of Taiwan and is easy to reach by train and high speed rail (THSR). It is the oldest city in Taiwan and also the first walled city in Taiwan. It has over 200 years of history as the capital of Taiwan.  
 IWOCA 2023 will be a hybrid conference   with both online and onsite participants.  
  Authors of accepted papers are expected to give an onsite talk or an online talk.
