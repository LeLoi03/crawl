 About  

 The 2023 Annual IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (IEEE PIMRC 2023). We are excited to bring this event to Toronto, Canada. The symposium has become one of the two major conferences of the IEEE Communications Society (ComSoc) in the field of wireless communications and networking. Originally founded in 1989 as a workshop in London and developed over the years to become a major international conference attracting the technical community from all regions and continents. The PIMRC 2023 will be composed of high quality technical sessions, panels, workshops and tutorials supported by PIMRC 2023 General Chairs, Technical Program Committee Chairs, Local Organizing Committee Chairs, Workshop and Tutorial Chairs, Panel Chairs, and Publication Chairs. IEEE PIMRC 2023 welcomes contributions reporting original research results in all areas of wireless technology as well as in applications, services, and business.
