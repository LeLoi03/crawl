 About  QUATIC    
  
 The  International Conference on the Quality of Information and Communications Technology (QUATIC)   is a leading scientific conference that gathers experts from industry and academia to exchange ideas and approaches regarding all quality aspects in ICT systems engineering and management. This forum seeks to foster lively discussion on how to further the state-of-the-art and define future directions, as well as to disseminate advanced new methods, techniques, and tools.  Information on previous editions can be found  here   .   
 QUATIC 2023 follows in the tradition of this conference, now in its 16th edition, and invites practitioners and researchers to submit technical papers reporting original research and experience results in all topics and sub-fields of Quality in ICT process, product, and applications domains, as well as sharing practical studies. Papers that are under simultaneous review from other research outlets or that are not substantial updates of previously published work will not be accepted.

Aveiro bursts with colour and joie de vivre!
