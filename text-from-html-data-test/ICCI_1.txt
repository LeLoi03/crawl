 Cognitive Informatics (CI) is a transdisciplinary field that studies the internal information processing mechanisms of the brain, the underpinning abstract intelligence (aI) theories and intelligent mathematics, and their engineering applications in cognitive computing, computational intelligence, autonomous AI, and cognitive systems. Cognitive Computing (CC) is a cutting-edge paradigm of intelligent computing methodologies and systems based on cognitive informatics, which implements computational intelligence generation by autonomous learning and inferences mimicking the mechanisms of the brain. CI and CC not only synergize theories of modern information science, computer science, communication theories, AI, cybernetics, computational intelligence, cognitive science, intelligence science, neuropsychology, brain science, systems science, software science, knowledge science, cognitive robots, cognitive linguistics, and life science, but also promote novel applications in cognitive computers, cognitive communications, computational intelligence, cognitive robots, autonomous systems, and the AI, IT, and software industries. The IEEE ICCI*CC series is a flagship conference of its field sponsored by IEEE CS, CIS, and SMC. Following the past 21 successful conferences on Cognitive Informatics and Cognitive Computing (ICCI’02 through ICCI*CC’22), the 22nd IEEE Int’l Conference on Cognitive Informatics and Cognitive Computing (ICCI*CC’23) focuses on themes of Intelligence Science, Cognitive Computers, Autonomous AI, Cognitive Robots, Brain-inspired Systems, Autonomous Machine Learning, and Autonomous Systems. ICCICC’23 welcomes researchers, practitioners, and graduate students to join the international initiative on cognitive informatics and cognitive computing toward the investigation of cognitive mechanisms and processes of human information processing, and the development of the next generation of cognitive computers and autonomous systems.
