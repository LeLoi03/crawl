 2023 INDIANA STATEWIDE CYBERSECURITY SUMMIT  
 Raising Indiana’s Cybersecurity Awareness   
  The 2nd Indiana Statewide Academic Alliance Summit  will be held as part of the CERIAS Symposium on day 1. Universities from across Indiana will present their research and initiatives in Lightning Talks.   
 Cybersecurity literacy is increasingly vital to business executives and leaders across industries, sectors and nations. Cyber attackers, ranging from hacktivists to organized crime networks to nation-states are targeting vulnerable networks and are frequently successful in stealing funds as well as valuable intellectual property. Cybersecurity is central to economic competitiveness and national security. Indiana’s universities are undertaking groundbreaking research and have robust operational capabilities that can help in this fight.
