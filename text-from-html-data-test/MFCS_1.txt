 Exploring the Space of Colourings with Kempe Changes (Invited Talk)   
 Authors:  Marthe Bonamy  
  Abstract    
 Kempe changes were introduced in 1879 in an attempt to prove the 4-colour theorem. They are a convenient if not crucial tool to prove various colouring theorems. Here, we consider how to navigate from a colouring to another through Kempe changes. When is it possible? How fast?

 Modern Parallel Algorithms (Invited Talk)   
 Authors:  Artur Czumaj  
  Abstract    
 Recent advances in the design of efficient parallel algorithms have been largely focusing on the nowadays classical model of parallel computing called Massive Parallel Computation (MPC), which follows the framework of MapReduce systems. In this talk we will survey recent advances in the design of algorithms for graph problems for the MPC model and will mention some interesting open questions in this area.

 Algebraic Reasoning for (Un)Solvable Loops (Invited Talk)   
 Authors:  Laura Kovács  
  Abstract    
 Loop invariants describe valid program properties that hold before and after every loop iteration. As such, loop invariants are the workhorses in formalizing loop semantics and automating the formal analysis and verification of programs with loops. While automatically synthesizing loop invariants is, in general, an uncomputable problem, when considering only single-path loops with linear updates (linear loops), the strongest polynomial invariant is in fact computable [Michael Karr, 1976; Markus Müller-Olm and Helmut Seidl, 2004; Laura Kovács, 2008; Ehud Hrushovski et al., 2018]. Yet, already for loops with "only" polynomial updates, computing the strongest invariant has been an open challenge since 2004 [Markus Müller-Olm and Helmut Seidl, 2004]. In this invited talk, we first present computability results on polynomial invariant synthesis for restricted polynomial loops, called solvable loops [Rodríguez-Carbonell and Kapur, 2004]. Key to solvable loops is that one can automatically compute invariants from closed-form solutions of algebraic recurrence equations that model the loop behaviour [Laura Kovács, 2008; Andreas Humenberger et al., 2017]. We also establish a technique for invariant synthesis for classes of loops that are not solvable, termed unsolvable loops [Daneshvar Amrollahi et al., 2022]. We next study the limits of computability in deriving the (strongest) polynomial invariants for arbitrary polynomial loops. We prove that computing the strongest polynomial invariant of arbitrary, single-path polynomial loops is very hard [Julian Müllner, 2023] - namely, it is at least as hard as the Skolem problem [Graham Everest et al., 2003; Terrence Tao, 2008], a prominent algebraic problem in the theory of linear recurrences. Going beyond single-path loops, we show that the strongest polynomial invariant is uncomputable already for multi-path polynomial loops with arbitrary quadratic polynomial updates [Laura Kovács and Anton Varonka, 2023].

 Sliding into the Future: Investigating Sliding Windows in Temporal Graphs (Invited Talk)   
 Authors:  Nina Klobas, George B. Mertzios, and Paul G. Spirakis  
  Abstract    
 Graphs are fundamental tools for modelling relations among objects in various scientific fields. However, traditional static graphs have limitations when it comes to capturing the dynamic nature of real-world systems. To overcome this limitation, temporal graphs have been introduced as a framework to model graphs that change over time. In temporal graphs the edges among vertices appear and disappear at specific time steps, reflecting the temporal dynamics of the observed system, which allows us to analyse time dependent patterns and processes. In this paper we focus on the research related to sliding time windows in temporal graphs. Sliding time windows offer a way to analyse specific time intervals within the lifespan of a temporal graph. By sliding the window along the timeline, we can examine the graph’s characteristics and properties within different time periods. This paper provides an overview of the research on sliding time windows in temporal graphs. Although progress has been made in this field, there are still many interesting questions and challenges to be explored. We discuss some of the open problems and highlight their potential for future research.

 Roman Census: Enumerating and Counting Roman Dominating Functions on Graph Classes   
 Authors:  Faisal N. Abu-Khzam, Henning Fernau, and Kevin Mann  
  Abstract    
 The concept of Roman domination has recently been studied concerning enumerating and counting in F. N. Abu-Khzam et al. (WG 2022). More technically speaking, a function that assigns 0,1,2 to the vertices of an undirected graph is called a Roman dominating function if each vertex assigned zero has a neighbor assigned two. Such a function is called minimal if decreasing any assignment to any vertex would yield a function that is no longer a Roman dominating function. It has been shown that minimal Roman dominating functions can be enumerated with polynomial delay, i.e., between any two outputs of a solution, no more than polynomial time will elapse. This contrasts what is known about minimal dominating sets, where the question whether or not these can be enumerated with polynomial delay is open for more than 40 years. This makes the concept of Roman domination rather special and interesting among the many variants of domination problems studied in the literature, as it has been shown for several of these variants that the question of enumerating minimal solutions is tightly linked to that of enumerating minimal dominating sets, see M. Kanté et al. in SIAM J. Disc. Math., 2014. The running time of the mentioned enumeration algorithm for minimal Roman dominating functions (Abu-Khzam et al., WG 2022) could be estimated as 𝒪(1.9332ⁿ) on general graphs of order n. Here, we focus on special graph classes, as has been also done for enumerating minimal dominating sets before. More specifically, for chordal graphs, we present an enumeration algorithm running in time 𝒪(1.8940ⁿ). It is unknown if this gives a tight bound on the maximum number of minimal Roman dominating functions in chordal graphs. For interval graphs, we can lower this time bound further to 𝒪(1.7321ⁿ), which also matches the known lower bound concerning the maximum number of minimal Roman dominating functions. We can also provide a matching lower and upper bound for forests, which is (incidentally) the same, namely 𝒪^*(√3ⁿ). Furthermore, we present an optimal enumeration algorithm running in time 𝒪^*(∛3ⁿ) for split graphs and for cobipartite graphs, i.e., we can also give a matching lower bound example for these graph classes. Hence, our enumeration algorithms for interval graphs, forests, split graphs and cobipartite graphs are all optimal. The importance of our results stems from the fact that, for other types of domination problems, optimal enumeration algorithms are not always found. Interestingly, we use a different form of analysis for the running times of our different algorithms, and the branchings had to be tailored and tweaked to obtain the intended optimality results. Our Roman dominating functions enumeration algorithm for trees and forests is distinctively different from the one for minimal dominating sets by Rote (SODA 2019).Our approach also allows to give concrete formulas for counting minimal Roman dominating functions on more concrete graph families like paths.

 Counting Computations with Formulae: Logical Characterisations of Counting Complexity Classes   
 Authors:  Antonis Achilleos and Aggeliki Chalki  
  Abstract    
 We present quantitative logics with two-step semantics based on the framework of quantitative logics introduced by Arenas et al. (2020) and the two-step semantics defined in the context of weighted logics by Gastin & Monmege (2018). We show that some of the fragments of our logics augmented with a least fixed point operator capture interesting classes of counting problems. Specifically, we answer an open question in the area of descriptive complexity of counting problems by providing logical characterisations of two subclasses of #P, namely SpanL and TotP, that play a significant role in the study of approximable counting problems. Moreover, we define logics that capture FPSPACE and SpanPSPACE, which are counting versions of PSPACE.

 Recognizing H-Graphs - Beyond Circular-Arc Graphs   
 Authors:  Deniz Ağaoğlu Çağırıcı, Onur Çağırıcı, Jan Derbisz, Tim A. Hartmann, Petr Hliněný, Jan Kratochvíl, Tomasz Krawczyk, and Peter Zeman  
  Abstract    
 In 1992 Biró, Hujter and Tuza introduced, for every fixed connected graph H, the class of H-graphs, defined as the intersection graphs of connected subgraphs of some subdivision of H. Such classes of graphs are related to many known graph classes: for example, K₂-graphs coincide with interval graphs, K₃-graphs with circular-arc graphs, the union of T-graphs, where T ranges over all trees, coincides with chordal graphs. Recently, quite a lot of research has been devoted to understanding the tractability border for various computational problems, such as recognition or isomorphism testing, in classes of H-graphs for different graphs H. In this work we undertake this research topic, focusing on the recognition problem. Chaplick, Töpfer, Voborník, and Zeman showed an XP-algorithm testing whether a given graph is a T-graph, where the parameter is the size of the tree T. In particular, for every fixed tree T the recognition of T-graphs can be solved in polynomial time. Tucker showed a polynomial time algorithm recognizing K₃-graphs (circular-arc graphs). On the other hand, Chaplick et al. showed also that for every fixed graph H containing two distinct cycles sharing an edge, the recognition of H-graphs is NP-hard. The main two results of this work narrow the gap between the NP-hard and 𝖯 cases of H-graph recognition. First, we show that the recognition of H-graphs is NP-hard when H contains two distinct cycles. On the other hand, we show a polynomial-time algorithm recognizing L-graphs, where L is a graph containing a cycle and an edge attached to it (which we call lollipop graphs). Our work leaves open the recognition problems of M-graphs for every unicyclic graph M different from a cycle and a lollipop.

 Descriptive Complexity for Distributed Computing with Circuits   
 Authors:  Veeti Ahvonen, Damian Heiman, Lauri Hella, and Antti Kuusisto  
  Abstract    
 We consider distributed algorithms in the realistic scenario where distributed message passing is operated by circuits. We show that within this setting, modal substitution calculus MSC precisely captures the expressive power of circuits. The result is established via constructing translations that are highly efficient in relation to size. We also observe that the coloring algorithm based on Cole-Vishkin can be specified by logarithmic size programs (and thus also logarithmic size circuits) in the bounded-degree scenario.

 Solving Irreducible Stochastic Mean-Payoff Games and Entropy Games by Relative Krasnoselskii-Mann Iteration   
 Authors:  Marianne Akian, Stéphane Gaubert, Ulysse Naepels, and Basile Terver  
  Abstract    
 We analyse an algorithm solving stochastic mean-payoff games, combining the ideas of relative value iteration and of Krasnoselskii-Mann damping. We derive parameterized complexity bounds for several classes of games satisfying irreducibility conditions. We show in particular that an ε-approximation of the value of an irreducible concurrent stochastic game can be computed in a number of iterations in O(|log(ε)|) where the constant in the O(⋅) is explicit, depending on the smallest non-zero transition probabilities. This should be compared with a bound in O(ε^{-1}|log(ε)|) obtained by Chatterjee and Ibsen-Jensen (ICALP 2014) for the same class of games, and to a O(ε^{-1}) bound by Allamigeon, Gaubert, Katz and Skomra (ICALP 2022) for turn-based games. We also establish parameterized complexity bounds for entropy games, a class of matrix multiplication games introduced by Asarin, Cervelle, Degorre, Dima, Horn and Kozyakin. We derive these results by methods of variational analysis, establishing contraction properties of the relative Krasnoselskii-Mann iteration with respect to Hilbert’s semi-norm.

 The Geometry of Reachability in Continuous Vector Addition Systems with States   
 Authors:  Shaull Almagor, Arka Ghosh, Tim Leys, and Guillermo A. Pérez  
  Abstract    
 We study the geometry of reachability sets of continuous vector addition systems with states (VASS). In particular we establish that they are "almost" Minkowski sums of convex cones and zonotopes generated by the vectors labelling the transitions of the VASS. We use the latter to prove that short so-called linear path schemes suffice as witnesses of reachability in continuous VASS. Then, we give new polynomial-time algorithms for the reachability problem for linear path schemes. Finally, we also establish that enriching the model with zero tests makes the reachability problem intractable already for linear path schemes of dimension two.

 Competitive Search in the Line and the Star with Predictions   
 Authors:  Spyros Angelopoulos  
  Abstract    
 We study the classic problem of searching for a hidden target in the line and the m-ray star, in a setting in which the searcher has some prediction on the hider’s position. We first focus on the main metric for comparing search strategies under predictions; namely, we give positive and negative results on the consistency-robustness tradeoff, where the performance of the strategy is evaluated at extreme situations in which the prediction is either error-free, or adversarially generated, respectively. For the line, we show tight bounds concerning this tradeoff, under the untrusted advice model, in which the prediction is in the form of a k-bit string which encodes the responses to k binary queries. For the star, we give tight, and near-tight tradeoffs in the positional and the directional models, in which the prediction is related to the position of the target within the star, and to the ray on which the target hides, respectively. Last, for all three prediction models, we show how to generalize our study to a setting in which the performance of the strategy is evaluated as a function of the searcher’s desired tolerance to prediction errors, both in terms of positive and inapproximability results.

 Rényi-Ulam Games and Online Computation with Imperfect Advice   
 Authors:  Spyros Angelopoulos and Shahin Kamali  
  Abstract    
 We study the nascent setting of online computation with imperfect advice, in which the online algorithm is enhanced by some prediction encoded in the form of an imperfect, and possibly erroneous binary string. The algorithm is oblivious to the advice error, but defines a desired tolerance, namely an upper bound on the number of erroneous advice bits it can tolerate. This is a model that generalizes the Pareto-based advice model, in which the performance of the algorithm is only evaluated at the extreme values of error (namely, if the advice has either no errors, or if it is generated adversarially). It also subsumes the model in which the algorithm elicits a prediction on the online sequence, via imperfect responses to a number of binary queries. In this work, we establish connections between games with a lying responder, also known as Rényi-Ulam games, and the design and analysis of online algorithms with imperfect advice. Specifically, we demonstrate how to obtain upper and lower bounds on the competitive ratio for important online problems such as time-series search, online bidding, and fractional knapsack. Our techniques provide the first lower bounds for online problems in this model. We also highlight and exploit connections between competitive analysis with imperfect advice and fault-tolerance in multiprocessor systems. Last, we show how to waive the dependence on the tolerance parameter, by means of resource augmentation and robustification.

 Multivariate to Bivariate Reduction for Noncommutative Polynomial Factorization   
 Authors:  Vikraman Arvind and Pushkar S. Joglekar  
  Abstract    
 Based on a theorem of Bergman [Cohn, 2006] we show that multivariate noncommutative polynomial factorization is deterministic polynomial-time reducible to the factorization of bivariate noncommutative polynomials. More precisely, we show the following: 1) In the white-box setting, given an n-variate noncommutative polynomial f ∈ 𝔽⟨X⟩ over a field 𝔽 (either a finite field or the rationals) as an arithmetic circuit (or algebraic branching program), computing a complete factorization of f into irreducible factors is deterministic polynomial-time reducible to white-box factorization of a noncommutative bivariate polynomial g ∈ 𝔽⟨x,y⟩; the reduction transforms f into a circuit for g (resp. ABP for g), and given a complete factorization of g (namely, arithmetic circuits (resp. ABPs) for irreducible factors of g) the reduction recovers a complete factorization of f in polynomial time. We also obtain a similar deterministic polynomial-time reduction in the black-box setting. 2) Additionally, we show over the field of rationals that bivariate linear matrix factorization of 4× 4 matrices is at least as hard as factoring square-free integers. This indicates that reducing noncommutative polynomial factorization to linear matrix factorization (as done in [Vikraman Arvind and Pushkar S. Joglekar, 2022]) is unlikely to succeed over the field of rationals even in the bivariate case. In contrast, multivariate linear matrix factorization for 3×3 matrices over rationals is in polynomial time.

 Entropic Risk for Turn-Based Stochastic Games   
 Authors:  Christel Baier, Krishnendu Chatterjee, Tobias Meggendorfer, and Jakob Piribauer  
  Abstract    
 Entropic risk (ERisk) is an established risk measure in finance, quantifying risk by an exponential re-weighting of rewards. We study ERisk for the first time in the context of turn-based stochastic games with the total reward objective. This gives rise to an objective function that demands the control of systems in a risk-averse manner. We show that the resulting games are determined and, in particular, admit optimal memoryless deterministic strategies. This contrasts risk measures that previously have been considered in the special case of Markov decision processes and that require randomization and/or memory. We provide several results on the decidability and the computational complexity of the threshold problem, i.e. whether the optimal value of ERisk exceeds a given threshold. In the most general case, the problem is decidable subject to Shanuel’s conjecture. If all inputs are rational, the resulting threshold problem can be solved using algebraic numbers, leading to decidability via a polynomial-time reduction to the existential theory of the reals. Further restrictions on the encoding of the input allow the solution of the threshold problem in NP∩coNP. Finally, an approximation algorithm for the optimal value of ERisk is provided.

 Speed Me up If You Can: Conditional Lower Bounds on Opacity Verification   
 Authors:  Jiří Balun, Tomáš Masopust, and Petr Osička  
  Abstract    
 Opacity is a property of privacy and security applications asking whether, given a system model, a passive intruder that makes online observations of system’s behaviour can ascertain some "secret" information of the system. Deciding opacity is a PSpace-complete problem, and hence there are no polynomial-time algorithms to verify opacity under the assumption that PSpace differs from PTime. This assumption, however, gives rise to a question whether the existing exponential-time algorithms are the best possible or whether there are faster, sub-exponential-time algorithms. We show that under the (Strong) Exponential Time Hypothesis, there are no algorithms that would be significantly faster than the existing algorithms. As a by-product, we obtained a new conditional lower bound on the time complexity of deciding universality (and therefore also inclusion and equivalence) for nondeterministic finite automata.

 Separating Automatic Relations   
 Authors:  Pablo Barceló, Diego Figueira, and Rémi Morvan  
  Abstract    
 We study the separability problem for automatic relations (i.e., relations on finite words definable by synchronous automata) in terms of recognizable relations (i.e., finite unions of products of regular languages). This problem takes as input two automatic relations R and R', and asks if there exists a recognizable relation S that contains R and does not intersect R'. We show this problem to be undecidable when the number of products allowed in the recognizable relation is fixed. In particular, checking if there exists a recognizable relation S with at most k products of regular languages that separates R from R' is undecidable, for each fixed k ⩾ 2. Our proofs reveal tight connections, of independent interest, between the separability problem and the finite coloring problem for automatic graphs, where colors are regular languages.

 On the Parameterized Complexity of Computing st-Orientations with Few Transitive Edges   
 Authors:  Carla Binucci, Giuseppe Liotta, Fabrizio Montecchiani, Giacomo Ortali, and Tommaso Piselli  
  Abstract    
 Orienting the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting digraph satisfies some given constraints is a classical problem in graph theory, with multiple algorithmic applications. In particular, an st-orientation orients each edge of the input graph such that the resulting digraph is acyclic, and it contains a single source s and a single sink t. Computing an st-orientation of a graph can be done efficiently, and it finds notable applications in graph algorithms and in particular in graph drawing. On the other hand, finding an st-orientation with at most k transitive edges is more challenging and it was recently proven to be NP-hard already when k = 0. We strengthen this result by showing that the problem remains NP-hard even for graphs of bounded diameter, and for graphs of bounded vertex degree. These computational lower bounds naturally raise the question about which structural parameters can lead to tractable parameterizations of the problem. Our main result is a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm parameterized by treewidth.

 Distributed CONGEST Algorithm for Finding Hamiltonian Paths in Dirac Graphs and Generalizations   
 Authors:  Noy Biton, Reut Levi, and Moti Medina  
  Abstract    
 We study the problem of finding a Hamiltonian cycle under the promise that the input graph has a minimum degree of at least n/2, where n denotes the number of vertices in the graph. The classical theorem of Dirac states that such graphs (a.k.a. Dirac graphs) are Hamiltonian, i.e., contain a Hamiltonian cycle. Moreover, finding a Hamiltonian cycle in Dirac graphs can be done in polynomial time in the classical centralized model. This paper presents a randomized distributed CONGEST algorithm that finds w.h.p. a Hamiltonian cycle (as well as maximum matching) within O(log n) rounds under the promise that the input graph is a Dirac graph. This upper bound is in contrast to general graphs in which both the decision and search variants of Hamiltonicity require Ω̃(n²) rounds, as shown by Bachrach et al. [PODC'19]. In addition, we consider two generalizations of Dirac graphs: Ore graphs and Rahman-Kaykobad graphs [IPL'05]. In Ore graphs, the sum of the degrees of every pair of non-adjacent vertices is at least n, and in Rahman-Kaykobad graphs, the sum of the degrees of every pair of non-adjacent vertices plus their distance is at least n+1. We show how our algorithm for Dirac graphs can be adapted to work for these more general families of graphs.

 Locality Theorems in Semiring Semantics   
 Authors:  Clotilde Bizière, Erich Grädel, and Matthias Naaf  
  Abstract    
 Semiring semantics of first-order logic generalises classical Boolean semantics by permitting truth values from a commutative semiring, which can model information such as costs or access restrictions. This raises the question to what extent classical model-theoretic properties still apply, and how this depends on the algebraic properties of the semiring. In this paper, we study this question for the classical locality theorems due to Hanf and Gaifman. We prove that Hanf’s locality theorem generalises to all semirings with idempotent operations, but fails for many non-idempotent semirings. We then consider Gaifman normal forms and show that for formulae with free variables, Gaifman’s theorem does not generalise beyond the Boolean semiring. Also for sentences, it fails in the natural semiring and the tropical semiring. Our main result, however, is a constructive proof of the existence of Gaifman normal forms for min-max and lattice semirings. The proof implies a stronger version of Gaifman’s classical theorem in Boolean semantics: every sentence has a Gaifman normal form which does not add negations.

 A Characterisation of Functions Computable in Polynomial Time and Space over the Reals with Discrete Ordinary Differential Equations: Simulation of Turing Machines with Analytic Discrete ODEs   
 Authors:  Manon Blanc and Olivier Bournez  
  Abstract    
 We prove that functions over the reals computable in polynomial time can be characterised using discrete ordinary differential equations (ODE), also known as finite differences. We also provide a characterisation of functions computable in polynomial space over the reals. In particular, this covers space complexity, while existing characterisations were only able to cover time complexity, and were restricted to functions over the integers, and we prove that no artificial sign or test function is needed even for time complexity. At a technical level, this is obtained by proving that Turing machines can be simulated with analytic discrete ordinary differential equations. We believe this result opens the way to many applications, as it opens the possibility of programming with ODEs, with an underlying well-understood time and space complexity.

 MaxCut Above Guarantee   
 Authors:  Ivan Bliznets and Vladislav Epifanov  
  Abstract    
 In this paper, we study the computational complexity of the Maximum Cut problem parameterized above guarantee. Our main result provides a linear kernel for the Maximum Cut problem in connected graphs parameterized above the spanning tree. This kernel significantly improves the previous O(k⁵) kernel given by Madathil, Saurabh, and Zehavi [ToCS 2020]. We also provide subexponential running time algorithms for this problem in special classes of graphs: chordal, split, and co-bipartite. We complete the picture by lower bounds under the assumption of the ETH. Moreover, we initiate a study of the Maximum Cut problem above 2/3|E| lower bound in tripartite graphs.

 Cryptanalysis of a Generalized Subset-Sum Pseudorandom Generator   
 Authors:  Charles Bouillaguet, Florette Martinez, and Damien Vergnaud  
  Abstract    
 We present attacks on a generalized subset-sum pseudorandom generator, which was proposed by von zur Gathen and Shparlinski in 2004. Our attacks rely on a sub-quadratic algorithm for solving a vectorial variant of the 3SUM problem, which is of independent interest. The attacks presented have complexities well below the brute-force attack, making the generators vulnerable. We provide a thorough analysis of the attacks and their complexities and demonstrate their practicality through implementations and experiments.

 The Compositional Structure of Bayesian Inference   
 Authors:  Dylan Braithwaite, Jules Hedges, and Toby St Clere Smithe  
  Abstract    
 Bayes' rule tells us how to invert a causal process in order to update our beliefs in light of new evidence. If the process is believed to have a complex compositional structure, we may observe that the inversion of the whole can be computed piecewise in terms of the component processes. We study the structure of this compositional rule, noting that it relates to the lens pattern in functional programming. Working in a suitably general axiomatic presentation of a category of Markov kernels, we see how we can think of Bayesian inversion as a particular instance of a state-dependent morphism in a fibred category. We discuss the compositional nature of this, formulated as a functor on the underlying category and explore how this can used for a more type-driven approach to statistical inference.

 Deterministic Constrained Multilinear Detection   
 Authors:  Cornelius Brand, Viktoriia Korchemna, and Michael Skotnica  
  Abstract    
 We extend the algebraic techniques of Brand and Pratt (ICALP'21) for deterministic detection of k-multilinear monomials in a given polynomial with non-negative coefficients to the more general situation of detecting colored k-multilinear monomials that satisfy additional constraints on the multiplicities of the colors appearing in them. Our techniques can be viewed as a characteristic-zero generalization of the algebraic tools developed by Guillemot and Sikora (MFCS'10) and Björklund, Kaski and Kowalik (STACS'13) As applications, we recover the state-of-the-art deterministic algorithms for the Graph Motif problem due to Pinter, Schachnai and Zehavi (MFCS'14), and give new deterministic algorithms for generalizations of certain questions on colored directed spanning trees or bipartite planar matchings running in deterministic time O^∗(4^k), studied originally by Gutin, Reidl, Wahlström and Zehavi (J. Comp. Sys. Sci. 95, '18). Finally, we give improved randomized algorithms for intersecting three and four matroids of rank k in characteristic zero, improving the record bounds of Brand and Pratt (ICALP'21) from O^∗(64^k) and O^∗(256^k), respectively, to O^∗(4^k).

 Rational Verification for Nash and Subgame-Perfect Equilibria in Graph Games   
 Authors:  Léonard Brice, Jean-François Raskin, and Marie van den Bogaard  
  Abstract    
 We study a natural problem about rational behaviors in multiplayer non-zero-sum sequential infinite duration games played on graphs: rational verification, that consists in deciding whether all the rational answers to a given strategy satisfy some specification. We give the complexities of that problem for two major concepts of rationality: Nash equilibria and subgame-perfect equilibria, and for three major classes of payoff functions: energy, discounted-sum, and mean-payoff.

 On Property Testing of the Binary Rank   
 Authors:  Nader H. Bshouty  
  Abstract    
 Let M be an n × m (0,1)-matrix. We define the s-binary rank, denoted as br_s(M), of M as the minimum integer d such that there exist d monochromatic rectangles covering all the 1-entries in the matrix, with each 1-entry being covered by at most s rectangles. When s = 1, this corresponds to the binary rank, denoted as br(M), which is well-known in the literature and has many applications. Let R(M) and C(M) denote the sets of rows and columns of M, respectively. Using the result of Sgall [Jiří Sgall, 1999], we establish that if M has an s-binary rank at most d, then |R(M)| ⋅ |C(M)| ≤ binom(d, ≤ s)2^d, where binom(d, ≤ s) = ∑_{i=0}^s binom(d,i). This bound is tight, meaning that there exists a matrix M' with an s-binary rank of d, for which |R(M')| ⋅ |C(M')| = binom(d, ≤ s)2^d. Using this result, we present novel one-sided adaptive and non-adaptive testers for (0,1)-matrices with an s-binary rank at most d (and exactly d). These testers require Õ(binom(d, ≤ s)2^d/ε) and Õ(binom(d, ≤ s)2^d/ε²) queries, respectively. For a fixed s, this improves upon the query complexity of the tester proposed by Parnas et al. in [Michal Parnas et al., 2021] by a factor of Θ(2^d).

 Short Definitions in Constraint Languages   
 Authors:  Jakub Bulín and Michael Kompatscher  
  Abstract    
 A first-order formula is called primitive positive (pp) if it only admits the use of existential quantifiers and conjunction. Pp-formulas are a central concept in (fixed-template) constraint satisfaction since CSP(Γ) can be viewed as the problem of deciding the primitive positive theory of Γ, and pp-definability captures gadget reductions between CSPs. An important class of tractable constraint languages Γ is characterized by having few subpowers, that is, the number of n-ary relations pp-definable from Γ is bounded by 2^p(n) for some polynomial p(n). In this paper we study a restriction of this property, stating that every pp-definable relation is definable by a pp-formula of polynomial length. We conjecture that the existence of such short definitions is actually equivalent to Γ having few subpowers, and verify this conjecture for a large subclass that, in particular, includes all constraint languages on three-element domains. We furthermore discuss how our conjecture imposes an upper complexity bound of co-NP on the subpower membership problem of algebras with few subpowers.

 The Online Simple Knapsack Problem with Reservation and Removability   
 Authors:  Elisabet Burjons, Matthias Gehnen, Henri Lotze, Daniel Mock, and Peter Rossmanith  
  Abstract    
 In the online simple knapsack problem, a knapsack of unit size 1 is given and an algorithm is tasked to fill it using a set of items that are revealed one after another. Each item must be accepted or rejected at the time they are presented, and these decisions are irrevocable. No prior knowledge about the set and sequence of items is given. The goal is then to maximize the sum of the sizes of all packed items compared to an optimal packing of all items of the sequence. In this paper, we combine two existing variants of the problem that each extend the range of possible actions for a newly presented item by a new option. The first is removability, in which an item that was previously packed into the knapsack may be finally discarded at any point. The second is reservations, which allows the algorithm to delay the decision on accepting or rejecting a new item indefinitely for a proportional fee relative to the size of the given item. If both removability and reservations are permitted, we show that the competitive ratio of the online simple knapsack problem rises depending on the relative reservation costs. As soon as any nonzero fee has to be paid for a reservation, no online algorithm can be better than 1.5-competitive. With rising reservation costs, this competitive ratio increases up to the golden ratio (ϕ ≈ 1.618) that is reached for relative reservation costs of 1-√5/3 ≈ 0.254. We provide a matching upper and lower bound for relative reservation costs up to this value. From this point onward, the tight bound by Iwama and Taketomi for the removable knapsack problem is the best possible competitive ratio, not using any reservations.

 Parikh One-Counter Automata   
 Authors:  Michaël Cadilhac, Arka Ghosh, Guillermo A. Pérez, and Ritam Raha  
  Abstract    
 Counting abilities in finite automata are traditionally provided by two orthogonal extensions: adding a single counter that can be tested for zeroness at any point, or adding ℤ-valued counters that are tested for equality only at the end of runs. In this paper, finite automata extended with both types of counters are introduced. They are called Parikh One-Counter Automata (POCA): the "Parikh" part referring to the evaluation of counters at the end of runs, and the "One-Counter" part to the single counter that can be tested during runs. Their expressiveness, in the deterministic and nondeterministic variants, is investigated; it is shown in particular that there are deterministic POCA languages that cannot be expressed without nondeterminism in the original models. The natural decision problems are also studied; strikingly, most of them are no harder than in the original models. A parametric version of nonemptiness is also considered.

 Authors:  Yixin Cao, Hanchun Yuan, and Jianxin Wang  
  Abstract    
 We present a 9^k ⋅ n^O(1)-time algorithm for the proper circular-arc vertex deletion problem, resolving an open problem of van ’t Hof and Villanger [Algorithmica 2013] and Crespelle et al. [Computer Science Review 2023]. Our structural study also implies parameterized algorithms for modification problems toward proper Helly circular-arc graphs.

 Isometric Path Complexity of Graphs   
 Authors:  Dibyayan Chakraborty, Jérémie Chalopin, Florent Foucaud, and Yann Vaxès  
  Abstract    
 A set S of isometric paths of a graph G is "v-rooted", where v is a vertex of G, if v is one of the end-vertices of all the isometric paths in S. The isometric path complexity of a graph G, denoted by ipco (G), is the minimum integer k such that there exists a vertex v ∈ V(G) satisfying the following property: the vertices of any isometric path P of G can be covered by k many v-rooted isometric paths. First, we provide an O(n² m)-time algorithm to compute the isometric path complexity of a graph with n vertices and m edges. Then we show that the isometric path complexity remains bounded for graphs in three seemingly unrelated graph classes, namely, hyperbolic graphs, (theta, prism, pyramid)-free graphs, and outerstring graphs. Hyperbolic graphs are extensively studied in Metric Graph Theory. The class of (theta, prism, pyramid)-free graphs are extensively studied in Structural Graph Theory, e.g. in the context of the Strong Perfect Graph Theorem. The class of outerstring graphs is studied in Geometric Graph Theory and Computational Geometry. Our results also show that the distance functions of these (structurally) different graph classes are more similar than previously thought. There is a direct algorithmic consequence of having small isometric path complexity. Specifically, using a result of Chakraborty et al. [ISAAC 2022], we show that if the isometric path complexity of a graph G is bounded by a constant k, then there exists a k-factor approximation algorithm for Isometric Path Cover, whose objective is to cover all vertices of a graph with a minimum number of isometric paths.

 Support Size Estimation: The Power of Conditioning   
 Authors:  Diptarka Chakraborty, Gunjan Kumar, and Kuldeep S. Meel  
  Abstract    
 We consider the problem of estimating the support size of a distribution D. Our investigations are pursued through the lens of distribution testing and seek to understand the power of conditional sampling (denoted as COND), wherein one is allowed to query the given distribution conditioned on an arbitrary subset S. The primary contribution of this work is to introduce a new approach to lower bounds for the COND model that relies on using powerful tools from information theory and communication complexity. Our approach allows us to obtain surprisingly strong lower bounds for the COND model and its extensions. - We bridge the longstanding gap between the upper bound O(log log n + 1/ε²) and the lower bound Ω(√{log log n}) for the COND model by providing a nearly matching lower bound. Surprisingly, we show that even if we get to know the actual probabilities along with COND samples, still Ω(log log n + 1/{ε² log (1/ε)}) queries are necessary. - We obtain the first non-trivial lower bound for the COND equipped with an additional oracle that reveals the actual as well as the conditional probabilities of the samples (to the best of our knowledge, this subsumes all of the models previously studied): in particular, we demonstrate that Ω(log log log n + 1/{ε² log (1/ε)}) queries are necessary.

 Query Complexity of Search Problems   
 Authors:  Arkadev Chattopadhyay, Yogesh Dahiya, and Meena Mahajan  
  Abstract    
 We relate various complexity measures like sensitivity, block sensitivity, certificate complexity for multi-output functions to the query complexities of such functions. Using these relations, we provide the following improvements upon the known relationship between pseudo-deterministic and deterministic query complexity for total search problems: - We show that deterministic query complexity is at most the third power of its pseudo-deterministic query complexity. Previously, a fourth-power relation was shown by Goldreich, Goldwasser and Ron (ITCS'13). - We improve the known separation between pseudo-deterministic and randomized decision tree size for total search problems in two ways: (1) we exhibit an exp(Ω̃(n^{1/4})) separation for the SearchCNF relation for random k-CNFs. This seems to be the first exponential lower bound on the pseudo-deterministic size complexity of SearchCNF associated with random k-CNFs. (2) we exhibit an exp(Ω(n)) separation for the ApproxHamWt relation. The previous best known separation for any relation was exp(Ω(n^{1/2})). We also separate pseudo-determinism from randomness in And and (And,Or) decision trees, and determinism from pseudo-determinism in Parity decision trees. For a hypercube colouring problem, that was introduced by Goldwasswer, Impagliazzo, Pitassi and Santhanam (CCC'21) to analyze the pseudo-deterministic complexity of a complete problem in TFNP^{dt}, we prove that either the monotone block-sensitivity or the anti-monotone block sensitivity is Ω(n^{1/3}); Goldwasser et al. showed an Ω(n^{1/2}) bound for general block-sensitivity.

 Tight Algorithmic Applications of Clique-Width Generalizations   
 Authors:  Vera Chekan and Stefan Kratsch  
  Abstract    
 In this work, we study two natural generalizations of clique-width introduced by Martin Fürer. Multi-clique-width (mcw) allows every vertex to hold multiple labels [ITCS 2017], while for fusion-width (fw) we have a possibility to merge all vertices of a certain label [LATIN 2014]. Fürer has shown that both parameters are upper-bounded by treewidth thus making them more appealing from an algorithmic perspective than clique-width and asked for applications of these parameters for problem solving. First, we determine the relation between these two parameters by showing that mcw ≤ fw + 1. Then we show that when parameterized by multi-clique-width, many problems (e.g., Connected Dominating Set) admit algorithms with the same running time as for clique-width despite the exponential gap between these two parameters. For some problems (e.g., Hamiltonian Cycle) we show an analogous result for fusion-width: For this we present an alternative view on fusion-width by introducing so-called glue-expressions which might be interesting on their own. All algorithms obtained in this work are tight up to (Strong) Exponential Time Hypothesis.

 An Iterative Approach for Counting Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams   
 Authors:  Julien Clément and Antoine Genitrini  
  Abstract    
 For three decades binary decision diagrams, a data structure efficiently representing Boolean functions, have been widely used in many distinct contexts like model verification, machine learning, cryptography and also resolution of combinatorial problems. The most famous variant, called reduced ordered binary decision diagram (robdd for short), can be viewed as the result of a compaction procedure on the full decision tree. A useful property is that once an order over the Boolean variables is fixed, each Boolean function is represented by exactly one robdd. In this paper we aim at computing the {exact distribution of the Boolean functions in k variables according to the robdd size}, where the robdd size is equal to the number of decision nodes of the underlying directed acyclic graph (dag) structure. Recall the number of Boolean functions with k variables is equal to 2^{2^k}, which is of double exponential growth with respect to the number of variables. The maximal size of a robdd with k variables is M_k ≈ 2^k / k. Apart from the natural combinatorial explosion observed, another difficulty for computing the distribution according to size is to take into account dependencies within the dag structure of robdds. In this paper, we develop the first polynomial algorithm to derive the distribution of Boolean functions over k variables with respect to robdd size denoted by n. The algorithm computes the (enumerative) generating function of robdds with k variables up to size n. It performs O(k n⁴) arithmetical operations on integers and necessitates storing O((k+n) n²) integers with bit length O(nlog n). Our new approach relies on a decomposition of robdds layer by layer and on an inclusion-exclusion argument.

 Inductive Continuity via Brouwer Trees   
 Authors:  Liron Cohen, Bruno da Rocha Paiva, Vincent Rahli, and Ayberk Tosun  
  Abstract    
 Continuity is a key principle of intuitionistic logic that is generally accepted by constructivists but is inconsistent with classical logic. Most commonly, continuity states that a function from the Baire space to numbers, only needs approximations of the points in the Baire space to compute. More recently, another formulation of the continuity principle was put forward. It states that for any function F from the Baire space to numbers, there exists a (dialogue) tree that contains the values of F at its leaves and such that the modulus of F at each point of the Baire space is given by the length of the corresponding branch in the tree. In this paper we provide the first internalization of this "inductive" continuity principle within a computational setting. Concretely, we present a class of intuitionistic theories that validate this formulation of continuity thanks to computations that construct such dialogue trees internally to the theories using effectful computations. We further demonstrate that this inductive continuity principle implies other forms of continuity principles.

 Approximating the Value of Energy-Parity Objectives in Simple Stochastic Games   
 Authors:  Mohan Dantam and Richard Mayr  
  Abstract    
 We consider simple stochastic games G with energy-parity objectives, a combination of quantitative rewards with a qualitative parity condition. The Maximizer tries to avoid running out of energy while simultaneously satisfying a parity condition. We present an algorithm to approximate the value of a given configuration in 2-NEXPTIME. Moreover, ε-optimal strategies for either player require at most O(2-EXP(|G|)⋅log(1/ε)) memory modes.

 Dynamic Planar Embedding Is in DynFO   
 Authors:  Samir Datta, Asif Khan, and Anish Mukherjee  
  Abstract    
 Planar Embedding is a drawing of a graph on the plane such that the edges do not intersect each other except at the vertices. We know that testing the planarity of a graph and computing its embedding (if it exists), can efficiently be computed, both sequentially [John E. Hopcroft and Robert Endre Tarjan, 1974] and in parallel [Vijaya Ramachandran and John H. Reif, 1994], when the entire graph is presented as input. In the dynamic setting, the input graph changes one edge at a time through insertion and deletions and planarity testing/embedding has to be updated after every change. By storing auxilliary information we can improve the complexity of dynamic planarity testing/embedding over the obvious recomputation from scratch. In the sequential dynamic setting, there has been a series of works [David Eppstein et al., 1996; Giuseppe F. Italiano et al., 1993; Jacob Holm et al., 2018; Jacob Holm and Eva Rotenberg, 2020], culminating in the breakthrough result of polylog(n) sequential time (amortized) planarity testing algorithm of Holm and Rotenberg [Jacob Holm and Eva Rotenberg, 2020]. In this paper we study planar embedding through the lens of DynFO, a parallel dynamic complexity class introduced by Patnaik et al [Sushant Patnaik and Neil Immerman, 1997] (also [Guozhu Dong et al., 1995]). We show that it is possible to dynamically maintain whether an edge can be inserted to a planar graph without causing non-planarity in DynFO. We extend this to show how to maintain an embedding of a planar graph under both edge insertions and deletions, while rejecting edge insertions that violate planarity. Our main idea is to maintain embeddings of only the triconnected components and a special two-colouring of separating pairs that enables us to side-step cascading flips when embedding of a biconnected planar graph changes, a major issue for sequential dynamic algorithms [Jacob Holm and Eva Rotenberg, 2020; Jacob Holm and Eva Rotenberg, 2020].

 Universality and Forall-Exactness of Cost Register Automata with Few Registers   
 Authors:  Laure Daviaud and Andrew Ryzhikov  
  Abstract    
 The universality problem asks whether a given finite state automaton accepts all the input words. For quantitative models of automata, where input words are mapped to real values, this is naturally extended to ask whether all the words are mapped to values above (or below) a given threshold. This is known to be undecidable for commonly studied examples such as weighted automata over the positive rational (plus-times) or the integer tropical (min-plus) semirings, or equivalently cost register automata (CRAs) over these semirings. In this paper, we prove that when restricted to CRAs with only three registers, the universality problem is still undecidable, even with additional restrictions for the CRAs to be copyless linear with resets. In contrast, we show that, assuming the unary encoding of updates, the ∀-exact problem (does the CRA output zero on all the words?) for integer min-plus linear CRAs can be decided in polynomial time if the number of registers is constant. Without the restriction on the number of registers this problem is known to be PSPACE-complete.

 Relaxed Core Stability for Hedonic Games with Size-Dependent Utilities   
 Authors:  Tom Demeulemeester and Jannik Peters  
  Abstract    
 We study relationships between different relaxed notions of core stability in hedonic games. In particular, we study (i) q-size core stable outcomes in which no deviating coalition of size at most q exists and (ii) k-improvement core stable outcomes in which no coalition can improve by a factor of more than k. For a large class of hedonic games, including fractional and additively separable hedonic games, we derive upper bounds on the maximum factor by which a coalition of a certain size can improve in a q-size core stable outcome. We further provide asymptotically tight lower bounds for a large class of hedonic games. Finally, our bounds allow us to confirm two conjectures by Fanelli et al. [Angelo Fanelli et al., 2021][IJCAI'21] for symmetric fractional hedonic games (S-FHGs): (i) every q-size core stable outcome in an S-FHG is also q/(q-1)-improvement core stable and (ii) the price of anarchy of q-size stability in S-FHGs is precisely 2q/q-1.

 Recontamination Helps a Lot to Hunt a Rabbit   
 Authors:  Thomas Dissaux, Foivos Fioravantes, Harmender Gahlawat, and Nicolas Nisse  
  Abstract    
 The Hunters and Rabbit game is played on a graph G where the Hunter player shoots at k vertices in every round while the Rabbit player occupies an unknown vertex and, if it is not shot, must move to a neighbouring vertex after each round. The Rabbit player wins if it can ensure that its position is never shot. The Hunter player wins otherwise. The hunter number h(G) of a graph G is the minimum integer k such that the Hunter player has a winning strategy (i.e., allowing him to win whatever be the strategy of the Rabbit player). This game has been studied in several graph classes, in particular in bipartite graphs (grids, trees, hypercubes...), but the computational complexity of computing h(G) remains open in general graphs and even in more restricted graph classes such as trees. To progress further in this study, we propose a notion of monotonicity (a well-studied and useful property in classical pursuit-evasion games such as Graph Searching games) for the Hunters and Rabbit game imposing that, roughly, a vertex that has already been shot "must not host the rabbit anymore". This allows us to obtain new results in various graph classes. More precisely, let the monotone hunter number mh(G) of a graph G be the minimum integer k such that the Hunter player has a monotone winning strategy. We show that pw(G) ≤ mh(G) ≤ pw(G)+1 for any graph G with pathwidth pw(G), which implies that computing mh(G), or even approximating mh(G) up to an additive constant, is NP-hard. Then, we show that mh(G) can be computed in polynomial time in split graphs, interval graphs, cographs and trees. These results go through structural characterisations which allow us to relate the monotone hunter number with the pathwidth in some of these graph classes. In all cases, this allows us to specify the hunter number or to show that there may be an arbitrary gap between h and mh, i.e., that monotonicity does not help. In particular, we show that, for every k ≥ 3, there exists a tree T with h(T) = 2 and mh(T) = k. We conclude by proving that computing h (resp., mh) is FPT parameterised by the minimum size of a vertex cover.

 String Diagrammatic Trace Theory   
 Authors:  Matthew Earnshaw and Paweł Sobociński  
  Abstract    
 We extend the theory of formal languages in monoidal categories to the multi-sorted, symmetric case, and show how this theory permits a graphical treatment of topics in concurrency. In particular, we show that Mazurkiewicz trace languages are precisely symmetric monoidal languages over monoidal distributed alphabets. We introduce symmetric monoidal automata, which define the class of regular symmetric monoidal languages. Furthermore, we prove that Zielonka’s asynchronous automata coincide with symmetric monoidal automata over monoidal distributed alphabets. Finally, we apply the string diagrams for symmetric premonoidal categories to derive serializations of traces.

 Upward Translation of Optimal and P-Optimal Proof Systems in the Boolean Hierarchy over NP   
 Authors:  Fabian Egidy, Christian Glaßer, and Martin Herold  
  Abstract    
 We study the existence of optimal and p-optimal proof systems for classes in the Boolean hierarchy over NP. Our main results concern DP, i.e., the second level of this hierarchy: - If all sets in DP have p-optimal proof systems, then all sets in coDP have p-optimal proof systems. - The analogous implication for optimal proof systems fails relative to an oracle. As a consequence, we clarify such implications for all classes 𝒞 and 𝒟 in the Boolean hierarchy over NP: either we can prove the implication or show that it fails relative to an oracle. Furthermore, we show that the sets SAT and TAUT have p-optimal proof systems, if and only if all sets in the Boolean hierarchy over NP have p-optimal proof systems which is a new characterization of a conjecture studied by Pudlák.

 Finding a Highly Connected Steiner Subgraph and its Applications   
 Authors:  Eduard Eiben, Diptapriyo Majumdar, and M. S. Ramanujan  
  Abstract    
 Given a (connected) undirected graph G, a set X ⊆ V(G) and integers k and p, the Steiner Subgraph Extension problem asks whether there exists a set S ⊇ X of at most k vertices such that G[S] is a p-edge-connected subgraph. This problem is a natural generalization of the well-studied Steiner Tree problem (set p = 1 and X to be the terminals). In this paper, we initiate the study of Steiner Subgraph Extension from the perspective of parameterized complexity and give a fixed-parameter algorithm (i.e., FPT algorithm) parameterized by k and p on graphs of bounded degeneracy (removing the assumption of bounded degeneracy results in W-hardness). Besides being an independent advance on the parameterized complexity of network design problems, our result has natural applications. In particular, we use our result to obtain new single-exponential FPT algorithms for several vertex-deletion problems studied in the literature, where the goal is to delete a smallest set of vertices such that: (i) the resulting graph belongs to a specified hereditary graph class, and (ii) the deleted set of vertices induces a p-edge-connected subgraph of the input graph.

 FPT Approximation and Subexponential Algorithms for Covering Few or Many Edges   
 Authors:  Fedor V. Fomin, Petr A. Golovach, Tanmay Inamdar, and Tomohiro Koana  
  Abstract    
 We study the α-Fixed Cardinality Graph Partitioning (α-FCGP) problem, the generic local graph partitioning problem introduced by Bonnet et al. [Algorithmica 2015]. In this problem, we are given a graph G, two numbers k,p and 0 ≤ α ≤ 1, the question is whether there is a set S ⊆ V of size k with a specified coverage function cov_α(S) at least p (or at most p for the minimization version). The coverage function cov_α(⋅) counts edges with exactly one endpoint in S with weight α and edges with both endpoints in S with weight 1 - α. α-FCGP generalizes a number of fundamental graph problems such as Densest k-Subgraph, Max k-Vertex Cover, and Max (k,n-k)-Cut. A natural question in the study of α-FCGP is whether the algorithmic results known for its special cases, like Max k-Vertex Cover, could be extended to more general settings. One of the simple but powerful methods for obtaining parameterized approximation [Manurangsi, SOSA 2019] and subexponential algorithms [Fomin et al. IPL 2011] for Max k-Vertex Cover is based on the greedy vertex degree orderings. The main insight of our work is that the idea of greed vertex degree ordering could be used to design fixed-parameter approximation schemes (FPT-AS) for α > 0 and the subexponential-time algorithms for the problem on apex-minor free graphs for maximization with α > 1/3 and minimization with α < 1/3.

 Graph Connectivity with Noisy Queries   
 Authors:  Dimitris Fotakis, Evangelia Gergatsouli, Charilaos Pipis, Miltiadis Stouras, and Christos Tzamos  
  Abstract    
 Graph connectivity is a fundamental combinatorial optimization problem that arises in many practical applications, where usually a spanning subgraph of a network is used for its operation. However, in the real world, links may fail unexpectedly deeming the networks non-operational, while checking whether a link is damaged is costly and possibly erroneous. After an event that has damaged an arbitrary subset of the edges, the network operator must find a spanning tree of the network using non-damaged edges by making as few checks as possible. Motivated by such questions, we study the problem of finding a spanning tree in a network, when we only have access to noisy queries of the form "Does edge e exist?". We design efficient algorithms, even when edges fail adversarially, for all possible error regimes; 2-sided error (where any answer might be erroneous), false positives (where "no" answers are always correct) and false negatives (where "yes" answers are always correct). In the first two regimes we provide efficient algorithms and give matching lower bounds for general graphs. In the False Negative case we design efficient algorithms for large interesting families of graphs (e.g. bounded treewidth, sparse). Using the previous results, we provide tight algorithms for the practically useful family of planar graphs in all error regimes.

 Positive Data Languages   
 Authors:  Florian Frank, Stefan Milius, and Henning Urbat  
  Abstract    
 Positive data languages are languages over an infinite alphabet closed under possibly non-injective renamings of data values. Informally, they model properties of data words expressible by assertions about equality, but not inequality, of data values occurring in the word. We investigate the class of positive data languages recognizable by nondeterministic orbit-finite nominal automata, an abstract form of register automata introduced by Bojańczyk, Klin, and Lasota. As our main contribution we provide a number of equivalent characterizations of that class in terms of positive register automata, monadic second-order logic with positive equality tests, and finitely presentable nondeterministic automata in the categories of nominal renaming sets and of presheaves over finite sets.

 Parameterized Analysis of the Cops and Robber Game   
 Authors:  Harmender Gahlawat and Meirav Zehavi  
  Abstract    
 Pursuit-evasion games have been intensively studied for several decades due to their numerous applications in artificial intelligence, robot motion planning, database theory, distributed computing, and algorithmic theory. Cops and Robber (CnR) is one of the most well-known pursuit-evasion games played on graphs, where multiple cops pursue a single robber. The aim is to compute the cop number of a graph, k, which is the minimum number of cops that ensures the capture of the robber. From the viewpoint of parameterized complexity, CnR is W[2]-hard parameterized by k [Fomin et al., TCS, 2010]. Thus, we study structural parameters of the input graph. We begin with the vertex cover number (vcn). First, we establish that k ≤ vcn/3+1. Second, we prove that CnR parameterized by vcn is FPT by designing an exponential kernel. We complement this result by showing that it is unlikely for CnR parameterized by vcn to admit a polynomial compression. We extend our exponential kernels to the parameters cluster vertex deletion number and deletion to stars number, and design a linear vertex kernel for neighborhood diversity. Additionally, we extend all of our results to several well-studied variations of CnR.

 An FPT Algorithm for Spanning Trees with Few Branch Vertices Parameterized by Modular-Width   
 Authors:  Luisa Gargano and Adele A. Rescigno  
  Abstract    
 The minimum branch vertices spanning tree problem consists in finding a spanning tree T of an input graph G having the minimum number of branch vertices, that is, vertices of degree at least three in T. This NP-hard problem has been widely studied in the literature and has many important applications in network design and optimization. Algorithmic and combinatorial aspects of the problem have been extensively studied and its fixed parameter tractability has been recently considered. In this paper we focus on modular-width and show that the problem of finding a spanning tree with the minimum number of branch vertices is FPT with respect to this parameter.

 Depth-3 Circuits for Inner Product   
 Authors:  Mika Göös, Ziyi Guan, and Tiberiu Mosnoi  
  Abstract    
 What is the Σ₃²-circuit complexity (depth 3, bottom-fanin 2) of the 2n-bit inner product function? The complexity is known to be exponential 2^{α_n n} for some α_n = Ω(1). We show that the limiting constant α := lim sup α_n satisfies 0.847... ≤ α ≤ 0.965... . Determining α is one of the seemingly-simplest open problems about depth-3 circuits. The question was recently raised by Golovnev, Kulikov, and Williams (ITCS 2021) and Frankl, Gryaznov, and Talebanfard (ITCS 2022), who observed that α ∈ [0.5,1]. To obtain our improved bounds, we analyse a covering LP that captures the Σ₃²-complexity up to polynomial factors. In particular, our lower bound is proved by constructing a feasible solution to the dual LP.

 On Polynomial-Time Decidability of k-Negations Fragments of FO Theories (Extended Abstract)   
 Authors:  Christoph Haase, Alessio Mansutti, and Amaury Pouly  
  Abstract    
 This paper introduces a generic framework that provides sufficient conditions for guaranteeing polynomial-time decidability of fixed-negation fragments of first-order theories that adhere to certain fixed-parameter tractability requirements. It enables deciding sentences of such theories with arbitrary existential quantification, conjunction and a fixed number of negation symbols in polynomial time. It was recently shown by Nguyen and Pak [SIAM J. Comput. 51(2): 1-31 (2022)] that an even more restricted such fragment of Presburger arithmetic (the first-order theory of the integers with addition and order) is NP-hard. In contrast, by application of our framework, we show that the fixed negation fragment of weak Presburger arithmetic, which drops the order relation from Presburger arithmetic in favour of equality, is decidable in polynomial time.

 The Covering Canadian Traveller Problem Revisited   
 Authors:  Niklas Hahn and Michalis Xefteris  
  Abstract    
 In this paper, we consider the k-Covering Canadian Traveller Problem (k-CCTP), which can be seen as a variant of the Travelling Salesperson Problem. The goal of k-CCTP is finding the shortest tour for a traveller to visit a set of locations in a given graph and return to the origin. Crucially, unknown to the traveller, up to k edges of the graph are blocked and the traveller only discovers blocked edges online at one of their respective endpoints. The currently best known upper bound for k-CCTP is O(√k) which was shown in [Huang and Liao, ISAAC '12]. We improve this polynomial bound to a logarithmic one by presenting a deterministic O(log k)-competitive algorithm that runs in polynomial time. Further, we demonstrate the tightness of our analysis by giving a lower bound instance for our algorithm.

 On the Complexity of Computing Time Series Medians Under the Move-Split-Merge Metric   
 Authors:  Jana Holznigenkemper, Christian Komusiewicz, Nils Morawietz, and Bernhard Seeger  
  Abstract    
 We initiate a study of the complexity of MSM-Median, the problem of computing a median of a set of k real-valued time series under the move-split-merge distance. This distance measure is based on three operations: moves, which may shift a data point in a time series; splits, which replace one data point in a time series by two consecutive data points of the same value; and merges, which replace two consecutive data points of equal value by a single data point of the same value. The cost of a move operation is the difference of the data point value before and after the operation, the cost of split and merge operations is defined via a given constant c. Our main results are as follows. First, we show that MSM-Median is NP-hard and W[1]-hard with respect to k for time series with at most three distinct values. Under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) our reduction implies that a previous dynamic programming algorithm with running time |I|^𝒪(k) [Holznigenkemper et al., Data Min. Knowl. Discov. '23] is essentially optimal. Here, |I| denotes the total input size. Second, we show that MSM-Median can be solved in 2^𝒪(d/c)⋅|I|^𝒪(1) time where d is the total distance of the median to the input time series.

 Fixed-Parameter Algorithms for Fair Hitting Set Problems   
 Authors:  Tanmay Inamdar, Lawqueen Kanesh, Madhumita Kundu, Nidhi Purohit, and Saket Saurabh  
  Abstract    
 Selection of a group of representatives satisfying certain fairness constraints, is a commonly occurring scenario. Motivated by this, we initiate a systematic algorithmic study of a fair version of Hitting Set. In the classical Hitting Set problem, the input is a universe 𝒰, a family ℱ of subsets of 𝒰, and a non-negative integer k. The goal is to determine whether there exists a subset S ⊆ 𝒰 of size k that hits (i.e., intersects) every set in ℱ. Inspired by several recent works, we formulate a fair version of this problem, as follows. The input additionally contains a family ℬ of subsets of 𝒰, where each subset in ℬ can be thought of as the group of elements of the same type. We want to find a set S ⊆ 𝒰 of size k that (i) hits all sets of ℱ, and (ii) does not contain too many elements of each type. We call this problem Fair Hitting Set, and chart out its tractability boundary from both classical as well as multivariate perspective. Our results use a multitude of techniques from parameterized complexity including classical to advanced tools, such as, methods of representative sets for matroids, FO model checking, and a generalization of best known kernels for Hitting Set.

 Parameterized Approximation Scheme for Feedback Vertex Set   
 Authors:  Satyabrata Jana, Daniel Lokshtanov, Soumen Mandal, Ashutosh Rai, and Saket Saurabh  
  Abstract    
 Feedback Vertex Set (FVS) is one of the most studied vertex deletion problems in the field of graph algorithms. In the decision version of the problem, given a graph G and an integer k, the question is whether there exists a set S of at most k vertices in G such that G-S is acyclic. It is one of the first few problems which were shown to be NP-complete, and has been extensively studied from the viewpoint of approximation and parameterized algorithms. The best-known polynomial time approximation algorithm for FVS is a 2-factor approximation, while the best known deterministic and randomized FPT algorithms run in time 𝒪^*(3.460^k) and 𝒪^*(2.7^k) respectively. In this paper, we contribute to the newly established area of parameterized approximation, by studying FVS in this paradigm. In particular, we combine the approaches of parameterized and approximation algorithms for the study of FVS, and achieve an approximation guarantee with a factor better than 2 in randomized FPT running time, that improves over the best known parameterized algorithm for FVS. We give three simple randomized (1+ε) approximation algorithms for FVS, running in times 𝒪^*(2^{εk}⋅ 2.7^{(1-ε)k}), 𝒪^*(({(4/(1+ε))^{(1+ε)}}⋅{(ε/3)^ε})^k), and 𝒪^*(4^{(1-ε)k}) respectively for every ε ∈ (0,1). Combining these three algorithms, we obtain a factor (1+ε) approximation algorithm for FVS, which has better running time than the best-known (randomized) FPT algorithm for every ε ∈ (0, 1). This is the first attempt to look at a parameterized approximation of FVS to the best of our knowledge. Our algorithms are very simple, and they rely on some well-known reduction rules used for arriving at FPT algorithms for FVS.

 Complexity Framework for Forbidden Subgraphs III: When Problems Are Tractable on Subcubic Graphs   
 Authors:  Matthew Johnson, Barnaby Martin, Sukanya Pandey, Daniël Paulusma, Siani Smith, and Erik Jan van Leeuwen  
  Abstract    
 For any finite set ℋ = {H_1,…,H_p} of graphs, a graph is ℋ-subgraph-free if it does not contain any of H_1,…,H_p as a subgraph. In recent work, meta-classifications have been studied: these show that if graph problems satisfy certain prescribed conditions, their complexity can be classified on classes of ℋ-subgraph-free graphs. We continue this work and focus on problems that have polynomial-time solutions on classes that have bounded treewidth or maximum degree at most 3 and examine their complexity on H-subgraph-free graph classes where H is a connected graph. With this approach, we obtain comprehensive classifications for (Independent) Feedback Vertex Set, Connected Vertex Cover, Colouring and Matching Cut. This resolves a number of open problems. We highlight that, to establish that Independent Feedback Vertex Set belongs to this collection of problems, we first show that it can be solved in polynomial time on graphs of maximum degree 3. We demonstrate that, with the exception of the complete graph on four vertices, each graph in this class has a minimum size feedback vertex set that is also an independent set.

 Polynomial-Delay Enumeration of Large Maximal Common Independent Sets in Two Matroids   
 Authors:  Yasuaki Kobayashi, Kazuhiro Kurita, and Kunihiro Wasa  
  Abstract    
 Finding a maximum cardinality common independent set in two matroids (also known as Matroid Intersection) is a classical combinatorial optimization problem, which generalizes several well-known problems, such as finding a maximum bipartite matching, a maximum colorful forest, and an arborescence in directed graphs. Enumerating all maximal common independent sets in two (or more) matroids is a classical enumeration problem. In this paper, we address an "intersection" of these problems: Given two matroids and a threshold τ, the goal is to enumerate all maximal common independent sets in the matroids with cardinality at least τ. We show that this problem can be solved in polynomial delay and polynomial space. We also discuss how to enumerate all maximal common independent sets of two matroids in non-increasing order of their cardinalities.

 Formalizing Hyperspaces for Extracting Efficient Exact Real Computation   
 Authors:  Michal Konečný, Sewon Park, and Holger Thies  
  Abstract    
 We propose a framework for certified computation on hyperspaces by formalizing various higher-order data types and operations in a constructive dependent type theory. Our approach builds on our previous work on axiomatization of exact real computation where we formalize nondeterministic first-order partial computations over real and complex numbers. Based on the axiomatization, we first define open, closed, compact and overt subsets in an abstract topological way that allows short and elegant proofs with computational content coinciding with standard definitions in computable analysis. From these proofs we extract programs for testing inclusion, overlapping of sets, et cetera. To improve extracted programs, our framework specializes the Euclidean space ℝ^m making use of metric properties. To define interesting operations over hyperspaces of Euclidean space, we introduce a nondeterministic version of a continuity principle valid under the standard type-2 realizability interpretation. Instead of choosing one of the usual formulations, we define it in a way similar to an interval extension operator, which often is already available in exact real computation software. We prove that the operations on subsets preserve the encoding, and thereby define a small calculus to built new subsets from given ones, including limits of converging sequences with regards to the Hausdorff metric. From the proofs, we extract programs that generate drawings of subsets of ℝ^m with any given precision efficiently. As an application we provide a function that constructs fractals, such as the Sierpinski triangle, from iterated function systems using the limit operation, resulting in certified programs that errorlessly draw such fractals up to any desired resolution.

 Set Semantics for Asynchronous TeamLTL: Expressivity and Complexity   
 Authors:  Juha Kontinen, Max Sandström, and Jonni Virtema  
  Abstract    
 We introduce and develop a set-based semantics for asynchronous TeamLTL. We consider two canonical logics in this setting: the extensions of TeamLTL by the Boolean disjunction and by the Boolean negation. We relate the new semantics with the original semantics based on multisets and establish one of the first positive complexity theoretic results in the temporal team semantics setting. In particular we show that both logics enjoy normal forms that can be utilised to obtain results related to expressivity and complexity (decidability) of the new logics.

 Parameterized Complexity of Domination Problems Using Restricted Modular Partitions   
 Authors:  Manuel Lafond and Weidong Luo  
  Abstract    
 For a graph class 𝒢, we define the 𝒢-modular cardinality of a graph G as the minimum size of a vertex partition of G into modules that each induces a graph in 𝒢. This generalizes other module-based graph parameters such as neighborhood diversity and iterated type partition. Moreover, if 𝒢 has bounded modular-width, the W[1]-hardness of a problem in 𝒢-modular cardinality implies hardness on modular-width, clique-width, and other related parameters. Several FPT algorithms based on modular partitions compute a solution table in each module, then combine each table into a global solution. This works well when each table has a succinct representation, but as we argue, when no such representation exists, the problem is typically W[1]-hard. We illustrate these ideas on the generic (α, β)-domination problem, which is a generalization of known domination problems such as Bounded Degree Deletion, k-Domination, and α-Domination. We show that for graph classes 𝒢 that require arbitrarily large solution tables, these problems are W[1]-hard in the 𝒢-modular cardinality, whereas they are fixed-parameter tractable when they admit succinct solution tables. This leads to several new positive and negative results for many domination problems parameterized by known and novel structural graph parameters such as clique-width, modular-width, and cluster-modular cardinality.

 Parameterized Max Min Feedback Vertex Set   
 Authors:  Michael Lampis, Nikolaos Melissinos, and Manolis Vasilakis  
  Abstract    
 Given a graph G and an integer k, Max Min FVS asks whether there exists a minimal set of vertices of size at least k whose deletion destroys all cycles. We present several results that improve upon the state of the art of the parameterized complexity of this problem with respect to both structural and natural parameters. Using standard DP techniques, we first present an algorithm of time tw^O(tw) n^O(1), significantly generalizing a recent algorithm of Gaikwad et al. of time vc^O(vc) n^O(1), where tw, vc denote the input graph’s treewidth and vertex cover respectively. Subsequently, we show that both of these algorithms are essentially optimal, since a vc^o(vc) n^O(1) algorithm would refute the ETH. With respect to the natural parameter k, the aforementioned recent work by Gaikwad et al. claimed an FPT branching algorithm with complexity 10^k n^O(1). We point out that this algorithm is incorrect and present a branching algorithm of complexity 9.34^k n^O(1).

 Distributed Merlin-Arthur Synthesis of Quantum States and Its Applications   
 Authors:  François Le Gall, Masayuki Miyamoto, and Harumichi Nishimura  
  Abstract    
 The generation and verification of quantum states are fundamental tasks for quantum information processing that have recently been investigated by Irani, Natarajan, Nirkhe, Rao and Yuen [CCC 2022], Rosenthal and Yuen [ITCS 2022], Metger and Yuen [QIP 2023] under the term state synthesis. This paper studies this concept from the viewpoint of quantum distributed computing, and especially distributed quantum Merlin-Arthur (dQMA) protocols. We first introduce a novel task, on a line, called state generation with distributed inputs (SGDI). In this task, the goal is to generate the quantum state U|ψ⟩ at the rightmost node of the line, where |ψ⟩ is a quantum state given at the leftmost node and U is a unitary matrix whose description is distributed over the nodes of the line. We give a dQMA protocol for SGDI and utilize this protocol to construct a dQMA protocol for the Set Equality problem studied by Naor, Parter and Yogev [SODA 2020], and complement our protocol by showing classical lower bounds for this problem. Our second contribution is a dQMA protocol, based on a recent work by Zhu and Hayashi [Physical Review A, 2019], to create EPR-pairs between adjacent nodes of a network without quantum communication. As an application of this dQMA protocol, we prove a general result showing how to convert any dQMA protocol on an arbitrary network into another dQMA protocol where the verification stage does not require any quantum communication.

 Dichotomies for Maximum Matching Cut: H-Freeness, Bounded Diameter, Bounded Radius   
 Authors:  Felicia Lucke, Daniël Paulusma, and Bernard Ries  
  Abstract    
 The (Perfect) Matching Cut problem is to decide if a graph G has a (perfect) matching cut, i.e., a (perfect) matching that is also an edge cut of G. Both Matching Cut and Perfect Matching Cut are known to be NP-complete, leading to many complexity results for both problems on special graph classes. A perfect matching cut is also a matching cut with maximum number of edges. To increase our understanding of the relationship between the two problems, we introduce the Maximum Matching Cut problem. This problem is to determine a largest matching cut in a graph. We generalize and unify known polynomial-time algorithms for Matching Cut and Perfect Matching Cut restricted to graphs of diameter at most 2 and to (P₆+sP₂)-free graphs. We also show that the complexity of Maximum Matching Cut differs from the complexities of Matching Cut and Perfect Matching Cut by proving NP-hardness of Maximum Matching Cut for 2P₃-free quadrangulated graphs of diameter 3 and radius 2 and for subcubic line graphs of triangle-free graphs. In this way, we obtain full dichotomies of Maximum Matching Cut for graphs of bounded diameter, bounded radius and H-free graphs.

 A Weyl Criterion for Finite-State Dimension and Applications   
 Authors:  Jack H. Lutz, Satyadev Nandakumar, and Subin Pulari  
  Abstract    
 Finite-state dimension, introduced early in this century as a finite-state version of classical Hausdorff dimension, is a quantitative measure of the lower asymptotic density of information in an infinite sequence over a finite alphabet, as perceived by finite automata. Finite-state dimension is a robust concept that now has equivalent formulations in terms of finite-state gambling, lossless finite-state data compression, finite-state prediction, entropy rates, and automatic Kolmogorov complexity. The 1972 Schnorr-Stimm dichotomy theorem gave the first automata-theoretic characterization of normal sequences, which had been studied in analytic number theory since Borel defined them in 1909. This theorem implies, in present-day terminology, that a sequence (or a real number having this sequence as its base-b expansion) is normal if and only if it has finite-state dimension 1. One of the most powerful classical tools for investigating normal numbers is the 1916 Weyl’s criterion, which characterizes normality in terms of exponential sums. Such sums are well studied objects with many connections to other aspects of analytic number theory, and this has made use of Weyl’s criterion especially fruitful. This raises the question whether Weyl’s criterion can be generalized from finite-state dimension 1 to arbitrary finite-state dimensions, thereby making it a quantitative tool for studying data compression, prediction, etc. i.e., Can we characterize all compression ratios using exponential sums?. This paper does exactly this. We extend Weyl’s criterion from a characterization of sequences with finite-state dimension 1 to a criterion that characterizes every finite-state dimension. This turns out not to be a routine generalization of the original Weyl criterion. Even though exponential sums may diverge for non-normal numbers, finite-state dimension can be characterized in terms of the dimensions of the subsequence limits of the exponential sums. In case the exponential sums are convergent, they converge to the Fourier coefficients of a probability measure whose dimension is precisely the finite-state dimension of the sequence. This new and surprising connection helps us bring Fourier analytic techniques to bear in proofs in finite-state dimension, yielding a new perspective. We demonstrate the utility of our criterion by substantially improving known results about preservation of finite-state dimension under arithmetic. We strictly generalize the results by Aistleitner and Doty, Lutz and Nandakumar for finite-state dimensions under arithmetic operations. We use the method of exponential sums and our Weyl criterion to obtain the following new result: If y is a number having finite-state strong dimension 0, then dim_FS(x+qy) = dim_FS(x) and Dim_FS(x+qy) = Dim_FS(x) for any x ∈ ℝ and q ∈ ℚ. This generalization uses recent estimates obtained in the work of Hochman [Hochman, 2014] regarding the entropy of convolutions of probability measures.

 On the Complexity Dichotomy for the Satisfiability of Systems of Term Equations over Finite Algebras   
 Authors:  Peter Mayr  
  Abstract    
 For a fixed finite algebra 𝐀, we consider the decision problem SysTerm(𝐀): does a given system of term equations have a solution in 𝐀? This is equivalent to a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) for a relational structure whose relations are the graphs of the basic operations of 𝐀. From the complexity dichotomy for CSP over fixed finite templates due to Bulatov [Bulatov, 2017] and Zhuk [Zhuk, 2017], it follows that SysTerm(𝐀) for a finite algebra 𝐀 is in P if 𝐀 has a not necessarily idempotent Taylor polymorphism and is NP-complete otherwise. More explicitly, we show that for a finite algebra 𝐀 in a congruence modular variety (e.g. for a quasigroup), SysTerm(𝐀) is in P if the core of 𝐀 is abelian and is NP-complete otherwise. Given 𝐀 by the graphs of its basic operations, we show that this condition for tractability can be decided in quasi-polynomial time.

 Parallel Enumeration of Parse Trees   
 Authors:  Margarita Mikhelson and Alexander Okhotin  
  Abstract    
 A parallel algorithm for enumerating parse trees of a given string according to a fixed context-free grammar is defined. The algorithm computes the number of parse trees of an input string; more generally, it applies to computing the weight of a string in a weighted grammar. The algorithm is first implemented on an arithmetic circuit of depth O((log n)²) with O(n⁶) elements. Then, it is improved using fast matrix multiplication to use only O(n^5.38) elements, while preserving depth O((log n)²).

 Spartan Bipartite Graphs Are Essentially Elementary   
 Authors:  Neeldhara Misra and Saraswati Girish Nanoti  
  Abstract    
 We study a two-player game on a graph between an attacker and a defender. To begin with, the defender places guards on a subset of vertices. In each move, the attacker attacks an edge. The defender must move at least one guard across the attacked edge to defend the attack. The defender wins if and only if the defender can defend an infinite sequence of attacks. The smallest number of guards with which the defender has a winning strategy is called the eternal vertex cover number of a graph G and is denoted by evc(G). It is clear that evc(G) is at least mvc(G), the size of a minimum vertex cover of G. We say that G is Spartan if evc(G) = mvc(G). The characterization of Spartan graphs has been largely open. In the setting of bipartite graphs on 2n vertices where every edge belongs to a perfect matching, an easy strategy is to have n guards that always move along perfect matchings in response to attacks. We show that these are essentially the only Spartan bipartite graphs.

 On the Finite Variable-Occurrence Fragment of the Calculus of Relations with Bounded Dot-Dagger Alternation   
 Authors:  Yoshiki Nakamura  
  Abstract    
 We introduce the k-variable-occurrence fragment, which is the set of terms having at most k occurrences of variables. We give a sufficient condition for the decidability of the equational theory of the k-variable-occurrence fragment using the finiteness of a monoid. As a case study, we prove that for Tarski’s calculus of relations with bounded dot-dagger alternation (an analogy of quantifier alternation in first-order logic), the equational theory of the k-variable-occurrence fragment is decidable for each k.

 Effective Continued Fraction Dimension Versus Effective Hausdorff Dimension of Reals   
 Authors:  Satyadev Nandakumar, Akhil S, and Prateek Vishnoi  
  Abstract    
 We establish that constructive continued fraction dimension originally defined using s-gales [Nandakumar and Vishnoi, 2022] is robust, but surprisingly, that the effective continued fraction dimension and effective (base-b) Hausdorff dimension of the same real can be unequal in general. We initially provide an equivalent characterization of continued fraction dimension using Kolmogorov complexity. In the process, we construct an optimal lower semi-computable s-gale for continued fractions. We also prove new bounds on the Lebesgue measure of continued fraction cylinders, which may be of independent interest. We apply these bounds to reveal an unexpected behavior of continued fraction dimension. It is known that feasible dimension is invariant with respect to base conversion [Hitchcock and Mayordomo, 2013]. We also know that Martin-Löf randomness and computable randomness are invariant not only with respect to base conversion, but also with respect to the continued fraction representation [Nandakumar and Vishnoi, 2022]. In contrast, for any 0 < ε < 0.5, we prove the existence of a real whose effective Hausdorff dimension is less than ε, but whose effective continued fraction dimension is greater than or equal to 0.5. This phenomenon is related to the "non-faithfulness" of certain families of covers, investigated by Peres and Torbin [Peres and Torbin] and by Albeverio, Ivanenko, Lebid and Torbin [Albeverio et al., 2020]. We also establish that for any real, the constructive Hausdorff dimension is at most its effective continued fraction dimension.

 On the Expressive Power of Regular Expressions with Backreferences   
 Authors:  Taisei Nogami and Tachio Terauchi  
  Abstract    
 A rewb is a regular expression extended with a feature called backreference. It is broadly known that backreference is a practical extension of regular expressions, and is supported by most modern regular expression engines, such as those in the standard libraries of Java, Python, and more. Meanwhile, indexed languages are the languages generated by indexed grammars, a formal grammar class proposed by A.V.Aho. We show that these two models' expressive powers are related in the following way: every language described by a rewb is an indexed language. As the smallest formal grammar class previously known to contain rewbs is the class of context sensitive languages, our result strictly improves the known upper-bound. Moreover, we prove the following two claims: there exists a rewb whose language does not belong to the class of stack languages, which is a proper subclass of indexed languages, and the language described by a rewb without a captured reference is in the class of nonerasing stack languages, which is a proper subclass of stack languages. Finally, we show that the hierarchy investigated in a prior study, which separates the expressive power of rewbs by the notion of nested levels, is within the class of nonerasing stack languages.

 OBDD(Join) Proofs Cannot Be Balanced   
 Authors:  Sergei Ovcharov  
  Abstract    
 We study OBDD-based propositional proof systems introduced in 2004 by Atserias, Kolaitis, and Vardi that prove the unsatisfiability of a CNF formula by deduction of an identically false OBDD from OBDDs representing clauses of the initial formula. We consider a proof system OBDD(∧) that uses only the conjunction (join) rule and a proof system OBDD(∧, reordering) (introduced in 2017 by Itsykson, Knop, Romashchenko, and Sokolov) that uses the conjunction (join) rule and the rule that allows changing the order of variables in OBDD. We study whether these systems can be balanced i.e. every refutation of size S can be reassembled into a refutation of depth O(log S) with at most a polynomial-size increase. We construct a family of unsatisfiable CNF formulas F_n such that F_n has a polynomial-size tree-like OBDD(∧) refutation of depth poly(n) and for arbitrary OBDD(∧, reordering) refutation Π of F_n for every α ∈ (0,1) the following trade-off holds: either the size of Π is 2^Ω(n^α) or the depth of Π is Ω(n^{1-α}). As a corollary of the trade-offs, we get that OBDD(∧) and OBDD(∧, reordering) proofs cannot be balanced.

 Lower Bounds for Choiceless Polynomial Time via Symmetric XOR-Circuits   
 Authors:  Benedikt Pago  
  Abstract    
 Choiceless Polynomial Time (CPT) is one of the few remaining candidate logics for capturing Ptime. In this paper, we make progress towards separating CPT from polynomial time by firstly establishing a connection between the expressive power of CPT and the existence of certain symmetric circuit families, and secondly, proving lower bounds against these circuits. We focus on the isomorphism problem of unordered Cai-Fürer-Immerman-graphs (the CFI-query) as a potential candidate for separating CPT from Ptime. Results by Dawar, Richerby and Rossman, and subsequently by Pakusa, Schalthöfer and Selman show that the CFI-query is CPT-definable on linearly ordered and preordered base graphs with small colour classes. We define a class of CPT-algorithms, that we call "CFI-symmetric algorithms", which generalises all the known ones, and show that such algorithms can only define the CFI-query on a given class of base graphs if there exists a family of symmetric XOR-circuits with certain properties. These properties include that the circuits have the same symmetries as the base graphs, are of polynomial size, and satisfy certain fan-in restrictions. Then we prove that such circuits with slightly strengthened requirements (i.e. stronger symmetry and fan-in and fan-out restrictions) do not exist for the n-dimensional hypercubes as base graphs. This almost separates the CFI-symmetric algorithms from Ptime - up to the gap that remains between the circuits whose existence we can currently disprove and the circuits whose existence is necessary for the definability of the CFI-query by a CFI-symmetric algorithm.

 A Super-Polynomial Separation Between Resolution and Cut-Free Sequent Calculus   
 Authors:  Theodoros Papamakarios  
  Abstract    
 We show a quadratic separation between resolution and cut-free sequent calculus width. We use this gap to get, for the first time, first, a super-polynomial separation between resolution and cut-free sequent calculus for refuting CNF formulas, and secondly, a quadratic separation between resolution width and monomial space in polynomial calculus with resolution. Our super-polynomial separation between resolution and cut-free sequent calculus only applies when clauses are seen as disjunctions of unbounded arity; our examples have linear size cut-free sequent calculus proofs writing, in a particular way, their clauses using binary disjunctions. Interestingly, this shows that the complexity of sequent calculus depends on how disjunctions are represented.

 Realizing Finitely Presented Groups as Projective Fundamental Groups of SFTs   
 Authors:  Léo Paviet Salomon and Pascal Vanier  
  Abstract    
 Subshifts are sets of colourings - or tilings - of the plane, defined by local constraints. Historically introduced as discretizations of continuous dynamical systems, they are also heavily related to computability theory. In this article, we study a conjugacy invariant for subshifts, known as the projective fundamental group. It is defined via paths inside and between configurations. We show that any finitely presented group can be realized as a projective fundamental group of some SFT.

 Deciding Predicate Logical Theories Of Real-Valued Functions   
 Authors:  Stefan Ratschan  
  Abstract    
 The notion of a real-valued function is central to mathematics, computer science, and many other scientific fields. Despite this importance, there are hardly any positive results on decision procedures for predicate logical theories that reason about real-valued functions. This paper defines a first-order predicate language for reasoning about multi-dimensional smooth real-valued functions and their derivatives, and demonstrates that - despite the obvious undecidability barriers - certain positive decidability results for such a language are indeed possible.

 A Polynomial-Time Algorithm for MCS Partial Search Order on Chordal Graphs   
 Authors:  Guozhen Rong, Yongjie Yang, and Wenjun Li  
  Abstract    
 We study the partial search order problem (PSOP) proposed recently by Scheffler [WG 2022]. Given a graph G together with a partial order on the set of vertices of G, this problem determines if there is an 𝒮-ordering that is consistent with the given partial order, where 𝒮 is a graph search paradigm like BFS, DFS, etc. This problem naturally generalizes the end-vertex problem which has received much attention over the past few years. It also generalizes the so-called ℱ-tree recognition problem which has just been studied in the literature recently. Our main contribution is a polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm for the PSOP of the maximum cardinality search (MCS) restricted to chordal graphs. This resolves one of the most intriguing open questions left in the work of Scheffler [WG 2022]. To obtain our result, we propose the notion of layer structure and study numerous related structural properties which might be of independent interest.

 Probabilistic Input-Driven Pushdown Automata   
 Authors:  Alex Rose and Alexander Okhotin  
  Abstract    
 A probabilistic variant of input-driven pushdown automata (IDPDA), also known as visibly pushdown automata, is introduced. It is proved that these automata can be determinized: an n-state probabilistic IDPDA that accepts each string with probability at least λ+δ or at most λ-δ is transformed to a deterministic IDPDA with at most (1 + 1/δ)^(n² - n) states recognizing the same language. An asymptotically close lower bound is provided: for infinitely many n, there is a probabilistic IDPDA with 4n + 1 states and δ = 1/(270n), such that every equivalent deterministic IDPDA needs at least 7^(n²/14) states. A few special cases of automata with reduced determinization complexity are identified.

 Counting Homomorphisms from Hypergraphs of Bounded Generalised Hypertree Width: A Logical Characterisation   
 Authors:  Benjamin Scheidt and Nicole Schweikardt  
  Abstract    
 We introduce the 2-sorted counting logic GC^k and its restriction RGC^k that express properties of hypergraphs. These logics have available k variables to address hyperedges, an unbounded number of variables to address vertices of a hypergraph, and atomic formulas E(e,v) to express that a vertex v is contained in a hyperedge e. We show that two hypergraphs H,H' satisfy the same sentences of the logic RGC^k if, and only if, they are homomorphism indistinguishable over the class of hypergraphs of generalised hypertree width at most k. Here, H,H' are called homomorphism indistinguishable over a class 𝒞 if for every hypergraph G ∈ 𝒞 the number of homomorphisms from G to H equals the number of homomorphisms from G to H'. This result can be viewed as a lifting (from graphs to hypergraphs) of a result by Dvořák (2010) stating that any two (undirected, simple, finite) graphs H,H' are indistinguishable by the k+1-variable counting logic C^{k+1} if, and only if, they are homomorphism indistinguishable over the class of graphs of tree-width at most k.

 Dynamic Constant Time Parallel Graph Algorithms with Sub-Linear Work   
 Authors:  Jonas Schmidt and Thomas Schwentick  
  Abstract    
 The paper proposes dynamic parallel algorithms for connectivity and bipartiteness of undirected graphs that require constant time and 𝒪(n^{1/2+ε}) work on the CRCW PRAM model. The work of these algorithms almost matches the work of the 𝒪(log n) time algorithm for connectivity by Kopelowitz et al. (2018) on the EREW PRAM model and the time of the sequential algorithm for bipartiteness by Eppstein et al. (1997). In particular, we show that the sparsification technique, which has been used in both mentioned papers, can in principle also be used for constant time algorithms in the CRCW PRAM model, despite the logarithmic depth of sparsification trees.

 On the Work of Dynamic Constant-Time Parallel Algorithms for Regular Tree Languages and Context-Free Languages   
 Authors:  Jonas Schmidt, Thomas Schwentick, and Jennifer Todtenhoefer  
  Abstract    
 Previous work on Dynamic Complexity has established that there exist dynamic constant-time parallel algorithms for regular tree languages and context-free languages under label or symbol changes. However, these algorithms were not developed with the goal to minimise work (or, equivalently, the number of processors). In fact, their inspection yields the work bounds 𝒪(n²) and 𝒪(n⁷) per change operation, respectively. In this paper, dynamic algorithms for regular tree languages are proposed that generalise the previous algorithms in that they allow unbounded node rank and leaf insertions, while improving the work bound from 𝒪(n²) to 𝒪(n^ε), for arbitrary ε > 0. For context-free languages, algorithms with better work bounds (compared with 𝒪(n⁷)) for restricted classes are proposed: for every ε > 0 there are such algorithms for deterministic context-free languages with work bound 𝒪(n^{3+ε}) and for visibly pushdown languages with work bound 𝒪(n^{2+ε}).

 Logical Equivalences, Homomorphism Indistinguishability, and Forbidden Minors   
 Authors:  Tim Seppelt  
  Abstract    
 Two graphs G and H are homomorphism indistinguishable over a class of graphs ℱ if for all graphs F ∈ ℱ the number of homomorphisms from F to G is equal to the number of homomorphisms from F to H. Many natural equivalence relations comparing graphs such as (quantum) isomorphism, spectral, and logical equivalences can be characterised as homomorphism indistinguishability relations over certain graph classes. Abstracting from the wealth of such instances, we show in this paper that equivalences w.r.t. any self-complementarity logic admitting a characterisation as homomorphism indistinguishability relation can be characterised by homomorphism indistinguishability over a minor-closed graph class. Self-complementarity is a mild property satisfied by most well-studied logics. This result follows from a correspondence between closure properties of a graph class and preservation properties of its homomorphism indistinguishability relation. Furthermore, we classify all graph classes which are in a sense finite (essentially profinite) and satisfy the maximality condition of being homomorphism distinguishing closed, i.e. adding any graph to the class strictly refines its homomorphism indistinguishability relation. Thereby, we answer various questions raised by Roberson (2022) on general properties of the homomorphism distinguishing closure.

 Decomposing Finite Languages   
 Authors:  Daniel Alexander Spenner  
  Abstract    
 The paper completely characterizes the primality of acyclic DFAs, where a DFA 𝒜 is prime if there do not exist DFAs 𝒜_1,… ,𝒜_t with ℒ(𝒜) = ⋂_{i=1}^t ℒ(𝒜_i) such that each 𝒜_i has strictly less states than the minimal DFA recognizing the same language as 𝒜. A regular language is prime if its minimal DFA is prime. Thus, this result also characterizes the primality of finite languages. Further, the NL-completeness of the corresponding decision problem Prime-DFA_fin is proven. The paper also characterizes the primality of acyclic DFAs under two different notions of compositionality, union and union-intersection compositionality. Additionally, the paper introduces the notion of S-primality, where a DFA 𝒜 is S-prime if there do not exist DFAs 𝒜₁,… ,𝒜_t with ℒ(𝒜) = ⋂_{i=1}^t ℒ(𝒜_i) such that each 𝒜_i has strictly less states than 𝒜 itself. It is proven that the problem of deciding S-primality for a given DFA is NL-hard. To do so, the NL-completeness of 2Minimal-DFA, the basic problem of deciding minimality for a DFA with at most two letters, is proven.

 Dependent k-Set Packing on Polynomoids   
 Authors:  Meng-Tsung Tsai, Shi-Chun Tsai, and Tsung-Ta Wu  
  Abstract    
 Specialized hereditary systems, e.g., matroids, are known to have many applications in algorithm design. We define a new notion called d-polynomoid as a hereditary system (E, ℱ ⊆ 2^E) so that every two maximal sets in ℱ have less than d elements in common. We study the problem that, given a d-polynomoid (E, ℱ), asks if the ground set E contains 𝓁 disjoint k-subsets that are not in ℱ, and obtain a complexity trichotomy result for all pairs of k ≥ 1 and d ≥ 0. Our algorithmic result yields a sufficient and necessary condition that decides whether each hypergraph in some classes of r-uniform hypergraphs has a perfect matching, which has a number of algorithmic applications.

 Exponential Lower Bounds for Threshold Circuits of Sub-Linear Depth and Energy   
 Authors:  Kei Uchizawa and Haruki Abe  
  Abstract    
 In this paper, we investigate computational power of threshold circuits and other theoretical models of neural networks in terms of the following four complexity measures: size (the number of gates), depth, weight and energy. Here, the energy of a circuit measures sparsity of their computation, and is defined as the maximum number of gates outputting non-zero values taken over all the input assignments. As our main result, we prove that any threshold circuit C of size s, depth d, energy e and weight w satisfies log(rk(M_C)) ≤ ed (log s + log w + log n), where rk(M_C) is the rank of the communication matrix M_C of a 2n-variable Boolean function that C computes. Thus, such a threshold circuit C is able to compute only a Boolean function of which communication matrix has rank bounded by a product of logarithmic factors of s, w and linear factors of d, e. This implies an exponential lower bound on the size of even sublinear-depth and sublinear-energy threshold circuit. For example, we can obtain an exponential lower bound s = 2^Ω(n^{1/3}) for threshold circuits of depth n^{1/3}, energy n^{1/3} and weight 2^o(n^{1/3}). We also show that the inequality is tight up to a constant factor when the depth d and energy e satisfies ed = o(n/log n). For other models of neural networks such as a discretized ReLU circuits and descretized sigmoid circuits, we define energy as the maximum number of gates outputting non-zero values. We then prove that a similar inequality also holds for a discretized circuit C: rk(M_C) = O(ed(log s + log w + log n)³). Thus, if we consider the number gates outputting non-zero values as a measure for sparse activity of a neural network, our results suggest that larger depth linearly helps neural networks to acquire sparse activity.

 Exact and Approximation Algorithms for Routing a Convoy Through a Graph   
 Authors:  Martijn van Ee, Tim Oosterwijk, René Sitters, and Andreas Wiese  
  Abstract    
 We study routing problems of a convoy in a graph, generalizing the shortest path problem (SPP), the travelling salesperson problem (TSP), and the Chinese postman problem (CPP) which are all well-studied in the classical (non-convoy) setting. We assume that each edge in the graph has a length and a speed at which it can be traversed and that our convoy has a given length. While the convoy moves through the graph, parts of it can be located on different edges. For safety requirements, at all time the whole convoy needs to travel at the same speed which is dictated by the slowest edge on which currently a part of the convoy is located. For Convoy-SPP, we give a strongly polynomial time exact algorithm. For Convoy-TSP, we provide an O(log n)-approximation algorithm and an O(1)-approximation algorithm for trees. Both results carry over to Convoy-CPP which - maybe surprisingly - we prove to be NP-hard in the convoy setting. This contrasts the non-convoy setting in which the problem is polynomial time solvable.

 Ordinal Measures of the Set of Finite Multisets   
 Authors:  Isa Vialard  
  Abstract    
 Well-partial orders, and the ordinal invariants used to measure them, are relevant in set theory, program verification, proof theory and many other areas of computer science and mathematics. In this article we focus on a common data structure in programming, finite multisets of some well partial order. There are two natural orders one can define on the set of finite multisets of a partial order: the multiset embedding and the multiset ordering. Though the maximal order type of these orders is already known, other ordinal invariants remain mostly unknown. Our main contributions are expressions to compute compositionally the width of the multiset embedding and the height of the multiset ordering. Furthermore, we provide a new ordinal invariant useful for characterizing the width of the multiset ordering.

 Checking Presence Reachability Properties on Parameterized Shared-Memory Systems   
 Authors:  Nicolas Waldburger  
  Abstract    
 We consider the verification of distributed systems composed of an arbitrary number of asynchronous processes. Processes are identical finite-state machines that communicate by reading from and writing to a shared memory. Beyond the standard model with finitely many registers, we tackle round-based shared-memory systems with fresh registers at each round. In the latter model, both the number of processes and the number of registers are unbounded, making verification particularly challenging. The properties studied are generic presence reachability objectives, which subsume classical questions such as safety or synchronization by expressing the presence or absence of processes in some states. In the more general round-based setting, we establish that the parameterized verification of presence reachability properties is PSPACE-complete. Moreover, for the roundless model with finitely many registers, we prove that the complexity drops down to NP-complete and we provide several natural restrictions that make the problem solvable in polynomial time.
