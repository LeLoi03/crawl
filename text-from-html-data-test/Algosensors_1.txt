 International Symposium on Algorithmics of Wireless Networks 2023  
 The International Symposium on Algorithmics of Wireless Networks  (ALGOSENSORS)  is an international symposium dedicated to the algorithmic aspects of wireless networks. Originally focused on sensor networks, it now covers algorithmic issues arising in wireless networks of all types of computational entities, static or mobile, including sensor networks, sensor-actuator networks, autonomous robots. The focus is on the design and analysis of algorithms, models of computation, and experimental analysis. ALGOSENSORS 2023 will be held in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. It will be part of ALGO 2023  , which also hosts ALGOCLOUD  , ATMOS  , ESA  , IPEC  and WAOA  . link: https://algo-conference.org/2023/algowin/   
 Note  : Starting from 2023 the event adopts a broader scope of wireless networks in general and its new acronym becomes ALGOWIN.

 ==============================  ========================  
 14th International Symposium on  
 Algorithms and Experiments for Wireless Networks  
 August 23-24, 2018  
 Helsinki, Finland  
 ==============================  ========================  
 Important Dates:  
 – Abstract Submission : May 30, 2018    
 – Submission: June 3, 2018

 AlgoSensors is an international symposium dedicated to the algorithmic aspects of wireless networks. Originally focused on sensor networks, it now covers algorithmic issues arising in wireless networks of all types of computational entities, static or mobile, including sensor networks, sensor-actuator networks, autonomous robots. The focus is on the design and analysis of algorithms, models of computation, and experimental analysis.  
 AlgoSensors 2018 will be part of ALGO 2018, which also hosts AlgoCloud, ATMOS, ESA, IPEC, WABI, and WAOA.  
 Submissions are sought in all areas of wireless networking, broadly construed, including both theoretical and experimental perspectives. This year AlgoSensors has two tracks:  
 – Algorithms & Theory  
 – Experiments & Applications  
 Each paper may be submitted only to one track.  
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 – Ad Hoc Networks  
 – Algorithms  
 – Approximation Algorithms  
 – Communication Protocols  
 – Complexity and Computability  
 – Computational Models  
 – Cryptography, Security and Trust  
 – Cyber Physical Systems  
 – Data Aggregation and Fusion  
 – Deployment

 – Error Correcting Codes  
 – Experimental Analysis  
 – Fault Tolerance and Dependability  
 – Game Theoretic Aspects  
 – Infrastructure Discovery  
 – Internet of Things (IoT)  
 – Localization  
 – Medium Access Control  
 – Mobility & Dynamics  
 – Obstacle Avoidance

 Submission guidelines:  
 Papers are to be submitted electronically using the EasyChair server. Original research papers must contain results that have not previously appeared and have not been concurrently submitted to a journal or conference with published proceedings. Each paper should select one of the two tracks (Algorithms & Theory or Experiments & Applications) for submission. Authors need to ensure that for each accepted paper at least one author will register and attend the symposium.  
  Submissions are limited to twelve (12) single-column pages in the LNCS format. This includes figures, but excludes references and an optional appendix (to be read at the program committee’s discretion). Papers will be published by LNCS after the conference.  
 Awards:  
  The best paper from each track will be given a Best Paper Award.
