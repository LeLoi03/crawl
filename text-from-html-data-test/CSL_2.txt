 CSL 2023: Computer Science Logic  
 13-16 Feb 2023  
  Warsaw, Poland   
 ======================= CSL 2023 University of Warsaw, Poland February 13-16, 2023 ======================= Computer Science Logic (CSL) is the annual conference of the European Association for Computer Science Logic (EACSL), see https://www.eacsl.org/. It is an interdisciplinary conference, spanning across both basic and application oriented research in mathematical logic and computer science. CSL 2023 will be held in the University of Warsaw on February 13-16, 2023 ( https://csl2023.mimuw.edu.pl/) Submission guidelines ===================== Submitted papers must be in English and must provide sufficient detail to allow the Program Committee to assess the merits of the paper. Full proofs may appear in a clearly marked technical appendix which will be read at the reviewers’ discretion. Authors are strongly encouraged to include a well written introduction which is directed at all members of the PC. The papers should be submitted via easychair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=csl2023 The CSL 2023 conference proceedings will be published in Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs), see https://submission.dagstuhl.de/documentation/authors. Authors are invited to submit contributed papers of no more than 15 pages in LIPIcs style (not including references), presenting unpublished work fitting the scope of the conference. Papers may not be submitted concurrently to another conference with refereed proceedings. The PC chairs should be informed of closely related work submitted to a conference or a journal. Papers authored or co-authored by members of the PC are not allowed. At least one of the authors of each accepted paper is expected to attend the conference in person to present their papers. Important dates =============== Abstract submission: July 9, 2022 (AoE) Paper submission: July 16, 2022 (AoE) Notification: September 30, 2022 Conference: February 13-16, 2023 Invited Speakers ================ Claudia Faggian (Université de Paris, France) Nina Gierasimczuk (Danish Technical University, Denmark) Dale Miller (Inria Saclay, France) Michał Pilipczuk (University of Warsaw, Poland) Davide Sangiorgi (University of Bologna, Italy) Helena-Rasiowa-Award ==================== The Helena Rasiowa Award is the best student paper award for the CSL conference series, starting from CSL 2022. The award will be given to the best paper (as decided by the PC) written solely by students or for which students were the main contributors. A student in this context is any person who is currently studying for a degree or whose PhD award date is less than one year prior to the first day of the conference.
