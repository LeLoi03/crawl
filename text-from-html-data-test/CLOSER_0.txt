 CLOSER 2023 will be held in conjunction with ICEIS 2023    , VEHITS 2023    and SMARTGREENS 2023    .   
  Registration to CLOSER allows free access to the ICEIS, VEHITS and SMARTGREENS conferences (as a non-speaker).  

  Although the conference is back to the normal mode (i.e., in-person) speakers are allowed to present remotely if unable to travel to the venue (hybrid support).    

 The International Conference on Cloud Computing and Services Science (CLOSER), focuses on the highly important area of Cloud Computing, inspired by some latest advances that concern the infrastructure, operations, and available services through the global network. Further, the conference considers as essential the link to Services Science, acknowledging the service-orientation in most current IT-driven collaborations. The conference is nevertheless not about the union of these two (already broad) fields, but about Cloud Computing where we are also interested in how Services Science can provide theory, methods and techniques to design, analyze, manage, market and study various aspects of Cloud Computing.
