 CALL FOR PAPERS  
 Deadline: January 13th, 2023  

 Track description and topics of interest   
 The CSCL track has a focus on the role of technology as a catalyst for social interaction and collaborative knowledge construction. Contemporary technologies, such as mobile devices, social media systems, cloud computing, web systems for adaptive and intelligent collaboration support, conversational agents, tangibles and tabletops and many others, provide exciting new opportunities for learners to communicate and collaborate in highly interactive learning environments. Enriched with innovative multimodal representations, such environments activate and challenge learners and stimulate knowledge building processes. Understanding these processes and their outcomes from various perspectives and at multiple levels is a major challenge for the CSCL researchers and educators.  
 The CSCL track provides a unique opportunity for researchers and practitioners who work in the broader area of technology-enhanced collaborative learning to present their latest work from a technological, empirical, theoretical, conceptual, and design-based perspective. The track invites papers (full/short/poster submissions) that reflect state-of-the-art research advances spanning both the technological dimension (design and development of CSCL tools) and the pedagogical perspective (implementation of CSCL tools in authentic contexts, impact of CSCL approaches, empirical results, and valuable reflections).  
 The pandemic situation posed challenges to our educational systems that have been addressed by widescale use of educational technology. The missing social contacts had to be addressed – at least partially – by a wider usage of collaborative tools and scenarios. Therefore, we especially encourage experience reports from practice that applied collaborative tools and scenarios for this year’s conference.  
 Major thematic areas of the track include:  
 Anecdotes and best practice of CSCL in emergency teaching during the pandemic 
  Empirical results of CSCL usage (lab and field studies) 
  Mobile and non-standard (e.g. tabletops, furniture, wearables, peer gaze awareness) technologies for collaborative learning 
  Learning analytics and interaction analysis to model, represent, and support group learning dynamics 
  Adaptive/Intelligent systems to support tutoring/scaffolding/scripting in CSCL settings 
  Learning Design and formalization approaches to support the CSCL perspective 
  Support of (web-based) learning communities with CSCL tools 
  Support of (web-based) workplace learning with CSCL tools 
  Use of social media and analysis of resulting networks in CSCL scenarios 
  Architectures and interoperability approaches for CSCL tools 
  Co-Construction of open educational resources and connectivist MOOCs 
  HCI Design issues of collaborative applications 
  Connecting digital and physical resources for collaborative learning 
  Internet of Things (IoT) in CSCL 
  Pedagogical agents to support the CSCL perspective 
  Computational thinking in CSCL settings 
  Collaboration, competition and conflict in educational games, gamification of CSCL scenarios 
  Teaching and Learning 21st century skills related to CSCL aspects 
  Peer assessment / Peer reviewing
