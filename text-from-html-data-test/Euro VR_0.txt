 EuroXR Association  would like to cordially invite you to contribute to the 20th EuroXR International Conference –   Eu  roXR  2023 ,   to be held collocated with  the Immersive Tech Week   from November 29th to December 1st  2023, at De Doelen,  in Rotterdam, The Netherlands.    

 ABOUT   
  
 This conference follows a series of successful international conferences initiated in 2004 by the INTUITION Network of Excellence in Virtual and Augmented Reality, supported by the European Commission until 2008. Embedded within the Joint Virtual Reality Conferences (JVRC) from 2009 to 2013, it was known as the EuroVR international conferences from 2014 and until 2020. This year, EuroXR will be held collocated with Immersive Tech Week (formerly VRDays)    
 Apart from annually gathering the EuroXR members for the association life, the focus of EuroXR conference is on novel VR/AR/MR technologies, including software systems, display technology, interaction devices, and applications. Besides papers on the latest scientific results and highlights from many application fields, the EuroXR conference series aims at creating a unique human-dimension framework, interconnecting European and international XR communities, for knowledge cross-fertilisations between researchers, technology providers, and end-users.   
 In-person conferences provide a unique opportunity for researchers to meet, chat, and catch up on the latest developments in the field, as well as absorb all the excellent talks and demos. It is also super important to build networks, especially for early career researchers.   
 Together we drive XR forward
