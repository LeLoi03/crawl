 About   
 The 15th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS) conference  will take place at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing on the University of California, Berkeley campus. It will be held in person  from Tuesday, January 30 to Friday February 2, 2024. The conference will run in a single track and all sessions will take place at the Calvin Lab auditorium.  
 ITCS seeks to promote research that carries a strong conceptual message (e.g., introducing a new concept, model or understanding, opening a new line of inquiry within traditional or interdisciplinary areas; introducing new mathematical techniques and methodologies; new applications of known techniques). ITCS welcomes both conceptual and technical contributions whose contents will advance and inspire the greater theory community.
