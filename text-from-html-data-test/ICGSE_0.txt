 About ICSSP Conference Series  
 ICSSP 2023 is the 17th in a series of ICSSP conferences that have been organized by the International Software and Systems Process Association (ISSPA) or its predecessor, the International Software Process Association (ISPA). The ICSSP series grew out of two earlier and partly overlapping series, the International Conferences on Software Process (ICSP), dating back to 1991, and the International Software Process Workshops (ISPW), dating back to 1984.  
 Recent ICSSP conferences have mostly been organized with or around ICSE, with proceedings published by ACM or IEEE. The 2021 and 2022 conferences were co-organized with the International Conference on Global Software Engineering (ICGSE), and ICSSP 2022 was co-sponsored and co-organized with the Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute. For the 2023 ICSSP, the ISSPA is pleased to be joining forces with representatives of CSRIO's Data61 unit, the data and digital specialist arm of Australia's national science agency.  
 About ICSSP 2023  
 In recent years, innovative software and systems technologies have been rapidly adopted with increasingly widespread but uncertain impacts. These technologies include various forms of AI; big data and data science; blockchain and distributed ledgers; augmented, virtual, and extended reality; low-code/no-code platforms; and even quantum computing (among others). By their novel nature, these new technologies and applications demand new approaches to software and systems development. Beyond that, the novelty and uncertainty surrounding these technologies and applications requires new and more effective approaches and processes to assuring correctness, understandability, predictability, responsibility, security, ethics and other vital qualities of our software and systems.  
 At the same time, many of these new technologies may have applications within the software life cycle. So the question naturally arises, can we put technologies such as AI, blockchain, low code, and big data, to work in improving our ability to develop, manage, and apply new software and systems applications. We can even ask whether it will become essential to do so.  
 ICSSP 2023 is focusing on software and systems processes for and with these new technologies, as well as on incorporating these new technologies into new modes of working in software and systems development for business, government, society, and the environment. ICSSP 2023 aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to share their research findings, experiences, and new ideas on diverse topics related to software and system processes. For 2023, the theme of the conference is: " Software and System Processes for and with Emerging Technologies  ". The goal is to advance both the state of the research and the state of the practice by applying innovative ideas from different fields of research to the future of software and system engineering processes.
