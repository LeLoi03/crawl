  The 29th International Computing and Combinatorics Conference (COCOON 2023) will be held in Honolulu, Hawaii, USA during December 15-17, 2023. Normally, COCOON is held in summer. For 2023, we hope to have a face-to-face conference and hence give enough time for oversea participants to apply for a visa.
