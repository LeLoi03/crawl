 IPSN 2023   
 The ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks  (IPSN) is the leading annual forum on research at the intersection of networked embedded sensing, control, and systems design. Now in its 22nd year, IPSN has been at the forefront of the development of today's "smart" systems. IPSN brings together researchers from academia, industry, and government to present and discuss recent advances in both theoretical and experimental research on all aspects of networked systems of sensors and actuators. Its scope includes signal and image processing information and coding theory, databases and information management, distributed algorithms, networks and protocols, wireless communications, collaborative objects the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, mobile and social sensing, and embedded systems design. Of special interest are contributions at the confluence of multiple of these areas. The call for papers can be found here  .  
 IPSN'23 is part of CPS-IoT Week 2023  , co-located with conferences HSCC, ICCPS IoTDI, and RTAS, as well as multiple workshops, tutorials, and competitions.
