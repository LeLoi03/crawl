 The International IFIP Cross Domain Conference for Machine Learning and Knowledge Extraction (CD-MAKE)  is a joint effort of several technical committees (TCs) and working groups (WGs) of the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) – IFIP TC 5 (Information Technology Applications), IFIP TC 12 (Artificial Intelligence; since 2018), IFIP WG 8.4 (E-Business: Multi-disciplinary Research and Practice), IFIP WG 8.9 (Enterprise Information Systems), IFIP WG 12.9 (Computational Intelligence)  
 The cross-domain conference is dedicated to offer an international platform for novel ideas and a fresh look on the methodologies to put crazy ideas into Business for the benefit of the human. Serendipity is a desired effect, and shall cross-fertilize methodologies and transfer of algorithmic developments.  
 The goal of the CD-MAKE conference is to bring together researchers from machine learning and knowledge extraction areas in an cross-disciplinary manner, to stimulate fresh ideas and to encourage multi-disciplinary problem solving.  
 Motto: Science is to test crazy ideas – Engineering is to put these ideas into Business!
