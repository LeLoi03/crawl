 News  
 DEXA 2025 | conferences and workshops will be held in Bangkok, Thailand from 25 - 27 August 2025 
   
  Over three decades ago, Prof. Dr. Roland Wagner  and Prof. Dr. A Min Tjoa  recognized the need for an international platform to address the rapidly growing fields of Databases and Expert Systems Applications. This vision gave birth to DEXA, a conference that began as a small gathering of innovative minds in Austria. Today, DEXA has evolved into a global event, attracting more than 5,000 participants—including distinguished speakers, researchers, developers, and industry experts—from around the world.  
 DEXA Organization  
 DEXA is organized by the DEXA Society  , a non-profit association dedicated to advancing knowledge in the field of information technology. In 2019, the leadership of DEXA transitioned to a collaboration between the Web Applications Society  (@WAS), the Institute of Telecooperation  at Johannes Kepler University Linz, and the Software Competence Center Hagenberg  (SCCH). This new partnership continues to uphold the founding vision, bringing cutting-edge research and technological advancements to the forefront.
