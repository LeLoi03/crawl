  About Interspeech 

 About Interspeech  
 ISCA manages the organization of an annual conference, Interspeech, which integrates two previous series of biennial international conferences: EUROSPEECH, the European Conference on Speech Communication and Technology, and ICSLP, the International Conference on Spoken Language Processing. Since 2000, both conferences have been held under the common label INTERSPEECH. The first Interspeech event was ICSLP 2000, which took place in 2000, in Beijing, China.      

  Previous EUROSPEECH conferences were held in 1989 in Paris (France); 1991 in Genoa (Italy); 1993 in Berlin (Germany); 1995 in Madrid (Spain); 1997 in Rhodes (Greece); and 1999 in Budapest (Hungary); Previous ICSLP conferences, coordinated by the Permanent Council for the Organization of International Conferences on Spoken Language Processing (PC-ICSLP), were held in 1990 in Kobe (Japan); 1992 in Banff (Canada); 1994 in Yokohama (Japan); 1996 in Philadelphia (USA); and 1998 in Sydney (Australia). All INTERSPEECH conferences are recorded chronologically here  .  
   
  INTERSPEECH conferences include papers on all the scientific and technological aspects of Speech. More than 1,000 participants from all over the world attend the conference annually to present their work in oral and poster sessions. Several satellite workshops and a Scientific and Industrial Exhibition highly enrich the conference content. INTERSPEECH conferences may be held in any country, although they generally should not occur in the same continent in two consecutive years. The next Interspeech conferences will be held in Greece (2024)  , Rotterdam, the Netherlands (2025)  , and Sydney, Australia (2026).   
 INTERSPEECH papers are indexed in ISI, Engineering Index, Scopus, and Google Scholar. It is rated as Rank A conference by the Computing and Research Education Association of Australasia ( CORE   ).
