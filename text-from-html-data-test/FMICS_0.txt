 Antwerp, Belgium, 20-22 September 2023  
 FMICS is the annual conference organised by the homonymous ERCIM working group. The aim of the conference series is to provide a forum for researchers who are interested in the development and application of formal methods in industry. FMICS brings together scientists and engineers who are active in the area of formal methods and are interested in exchanging their experiences of the industrial usage of these methods. The FMICS conference series also strives to promote research and development for the improvement of formal methods and tools for industrial applications. As in previous years, FMICS 2023 is part of the CONFEST umbrella conference. In addition to FMICS, CONFEST also comprises CONCUR, FORMATS, and QEST, as well as pre- and post-conference workshops and tutorials. CONFEST will be held in Antwerp, Belgium on 18-23 September 2023.  
 Topics   
  Topics of interest include: Case studies and experience reports on industrial applications of formal methods; Methods, techniques, and tools to support automated analysis, certification, debugging, descriptions, learning, optimization, and transformation of complex, distributed, real-time, embedded, mobile and autonomous systems; Verification and validation methods that address shortcomings of existing methods with respect to their industrial applicability; Impact of the adoption of formal methods on the development process and associated costs; Application of formal methods in standardization and industrial forums.  
 Deadlines   
  The paper submission deadline is 15 May 2023. Accepted papers will be included in the Conference Proceedings published as part of Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. An award will be presented to the authors of the submission selected by the Program Committee as the FMICS 2023 Best Paper.  
 Programme Committee Chairs   
  • Alessandro Cimatti (FBK, Italy)  
  • Laura Titolo (NIA/NASA LaRC, USA).
