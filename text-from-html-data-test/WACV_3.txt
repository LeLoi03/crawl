 Research Engineer in Synthetic Data Generation and Augmentation (f/m/div.)   
 Bosch Center for AI  |  Germany, Stuttgart Area    
 We conduct research on state-of-the-art deep generative models that are used to enable real-world Bosch systems to be data-efficient. We are looking for a research engineer to support us both in academic research activities and in transferring those results to real-world systems.  
 The goal of this position is to develop new learning algorithms for generating better training datasets, making algorithms robust, reliable, and safe when learning even from limited/biased datasets. In particular, the focus is on the use of generative models for data augmentation: generation of synthetic data using both computer graphics and image-synthesis with generative models (i.e., GANs, diffusion models, neural rendering), as well as techniques for domain transfer.
