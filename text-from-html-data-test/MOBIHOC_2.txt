  MobiHoc 2025 -ACM International Symposium on Mobile Ad Hoc Networking and Computing  
 Send this CFP to us by mail: cfp@ourglocal.org  
 Introduction  : ACM MobiHoc is the premier international symposium dedicated to addressing challenges emerging from wireless ad hoc networking and computing. With its highly selective technical program, the symposium will bring together researchers and practitioners from a broad spectrum of wireless networking research to present the most up-to-date results and achievements in the field.  
  
 We invite paper submissions on mobile ad hoc networks, wireless sensor networks, wireless mesh networks, vehicular networks and ad hoc computing systems, with the focus being on issues at and above the MAC layer. Besides theoretical works, papers on practical issues are also very welcome. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to the following:  
  
 Applications and middleware support  
 Transport, network, and MAC protocols  
 Energy efficiency  
 Location discovery  
 Cross-layer design and control  
 Network resilience, fault-tolerance, and reliability  
 Functional computation and data aggregation  
 Modeling and performance analysis  
 Scaling laws and fundamental limits  
 Network coding  
 Opportunistic and delay-tolerant networks  
 Vehicular networks  
 Cognitive radio networks  
 Distributed sensing, actuation, control, and coordination  
 Trust, security and privacy  
 System design and testbeds  
 Measurements from experimental systems  
  
 The symposium especially encourages the submission of exploratory studies that identify new challenges in the network design, innovative services, and applications that may stimulate far-reaching future research.
