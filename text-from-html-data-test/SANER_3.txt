 Introduction  
   
 AboutComputing and Processing  
  Keywords:software analysis,software evolution,software reengineering,software maintenance,software engineering,  
  Scope:SANER is the premier event on the theory and practice of recovering information from existing software and systems. The event explores innovative methods to extract the many kinds of information that can be recovered from software, software engineering documents, and systems artifacts, and examines innovative ways of using this information in system renewal and program understanding. SANER promotes discussion and interaction among researchers and practitioners about the development of maintainable systems, and the improvement, evolution, migration, and reengineering of existing systems. The venue also explores innovative methods of extraction for the many kinds of information of interest to software developers and examines innovative ways of using this information in system renewal and program understanding.
