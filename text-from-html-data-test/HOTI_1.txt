 Welcome to the 30th iteration of the IEEE Hot Interconnects symposium. HotI30 will be held virtually.  
 IEEE Hot Interconnects is the premier international forum for researchers and developers of state-of-the-art hardware and software architectures and implementations for interconnection networks of all scales, ranging from multi-core on-chip interconnects to those within systems clusters, and data centers. Leaders in industry and academia attend the conference to interact with individuals at the forefront of this field.  
 Our objective is to address the data center networking and the supercomputing communities. We hope you can join us and benefit not only from the content but also from the prime networking opportunities this event always offers.

 PANEL  

 Accelerator Interconnects   

 Nearly all the emerging, high-value applications, especially those residing on the edge, use accelerators rather than CPUs for their essential functions. Moreover, in a cluster of any size, including at the edge, multiple accelerators are employed to meet the dynamic demands of such applications. These accelerators can be of the same type, as a pool, or of different types. But as with the case of CPUs, the performance of the system is almost always limited by the I/O or interconnect. Therefore, we want to explore how the interconnections of accelerators not only avoid being the bottleneck but more importantly make it possible for the accelerators to work in concert to enable new applications and revolutionize the architecture of computing. This panel will explore the most innovative approaches to accelerator interconnects to take fullest advantage of the capability of these amazing accelerators.

 IEEE Computer Society Open Conference Statement  

 Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion are central to the goals of the IEEE Computer Society and all of its conferences. Equity at its heart is about removing barriers, biases, and obstacles that impede equal access and opportunity to succeed. Diversity is fundamentally about valuing human differences and recognizing diverse talents. Inclusion is the active engagement of Diversity and Equity. A goal of the IEEE Computer Society is to foster an environment in which all individuals are entitled to participate in any IEEE Computer Society activity free of discrimination.  
 For this reason, the IEEE Computer Society is firmly committed to team compositions in all sponsored activities, including but not limited to, technical committees, steering committees, conference organizations, standards committees, and ad hoc committees that display Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion.  
 IEEE Computer Society meetings, conferences and workshops must provide a welcoming, open and safe environment, that embraces the value of every person, regardless of race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, marital status, religion, national origin, ancestry, or disability. All individuals are entitled to participate in any IEEE Computer Society activity free of discrimination, including harassment based on any of the above factors.  

 IEEE Event Conduct and Safety Statement  

 IEEE believes that science, technology, and engineering are fundamental human activities, for which openness, international collaboration, and the free flow of talent and ideas are essential. Its meetings, conferences, and other events seek to enable engaging, thought provoking conversations that support IEEE’s core mission of advancing technology for humanity. Accordingly, IEEE is committed to providing a safe, productive, and welcoming environment to all participants, including staff and vendors, at IEEE-related events.  
 IEEE has no tolerance for discrimination, harassment, or bullying in any form at IEEE- related events. All participants have the right to pursue shared interests without harassment or discrimination in an environment that supports diversity and inclusion. Participants are expected to adhere to these principles and respect the rights of others. IEEE seeks to provide a secure environment at its events. Participants should report  
  any behavior inconsistent with the principles outlined here, to on site staff, security or venue personnel, or to eventconduct@ieee.org
