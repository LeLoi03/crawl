 ISSAC 2023  
 The International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation (ISSAC) is the premier conference for research in symbolic computation and computer algebra. ISSAC 2023 will be the 48th meeting in the series, which started in 1966 and has been held annually since 1981. The conference presents a range of invited speakers, tutorials, short communications, software demonstrations and vendor exhibits with a center-piece of contributed research papers.

 Conference topics  
 All areas of computer algebra and symbolic computation are of interest at ISSAC 2023. These include, but are not limited to:  
   
 Algorithmic aspects:   
 Exact and symbolic linear, polynomial and differential algebra 
  Symbolic-numeric, homotopy, perturbation and series methods 
  Computational algebraic geometry, polynomial and semialgebraic optimization 
  Computational group theory and number theory, quantifier elimination and logic 
  Computer arithmetic 
  Summation, recurrence equations, integration, solution of ODEs & PDEs 
  Symbolic methods in other areas of pure and applied mathematics 
  Complexity of algebraic algorithms and algebraic complexity 
  Software aspects:   
 Design of symbolic computation packages and systems 
  Language design and type systems for symbolic computation 
  Data representation 
  Considerations for modern hardware 
  Algorithm implementation and performance tuning 
  Mathematical user interfaces 
  Use with systems such as digital libraries, courseware, simulation and optimization, automated theorem-proving, computer-aided design, and automatic differentiation. 
  Application aspects:   
 Applications that stretch the current limits of computer algebra algorithms or systems, use computer algebra in new areas or new ways, or apply it in situations with broad impact. 
   
 Invited speakers  
 The conference features three invited talks by the following speakers:  
 Nikhil Srivastava | , UC Berkeley, USA | The Complexity of Diagonalization 
  Rekha R. Thomas | , University of Washington, USA | Classical Invariant Theory in Computer Vision
