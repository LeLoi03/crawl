  Call for Papers 
  The 20th International Conference on Managed Programming Languages & Runtimes (MPLR’23, formerly ManLang, originally PPPJ) is a premier forum for presenting and discussing novel results in all aspects of managed programming languages and runtime systems, which serve as building blocks for some of the most important computing systems around, ranging from small-scale (embedded and real-time systems) to large-scale (cloud-computing and big-data platforms) and anything in between (mobile, IoT, and wearable applications).  
 Papers accepted by MPLR’23 describe original research results and have not been published anywhere else. Each submitted paper has received a minimum of three reviews by members of the program committee. Papers have been selected based on their originality, relevance, technical clarity, and quality of presentation. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the MPLR’23 symposium and present the paper.

 Time Band   
   
 By setting a time band, the program will dim events that are outside this time window. This is useful for (virtual) conferences with a continuous program (with repeated sessions).  
  The time band will also limit the events that are included in the personal iCalendar subscription service.   Display full program    Specify a time band   -

 Call for Papers  
  
 The 20th International Conference on Managed Programming Languages & Runtimes (MPLR, formerly ManLang, originally PPPJ) is a premier forum for presenting and discussing novel results in all aspects of managed programming languages and runtime systems, which serve as building blocks for some of the most important computing systems in use, ranging from small-scale (embedded and real-time systems) to large-scale (cloud-computing and big-data platforms) and anything in between (desktop, mobile, IoT, and wearable applications).  
 Topics   
 The areas of interest include but are not limited to:  
 Languages and Compilers | Managed languages (e.g., Java, Scala, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, C#, F#, Clojure, Groovy, Kotlin, R, Smalltalk, Racket, Rust, Go, Lua, MATLAB, Raku, Pony, …) 
  Portable intermediate representations such as WebAssembly 
  Domain-specific languages 
  Language design 
  Compilers and interpreters 
  Type systems and program logics 
  Language interoperability 
  Parallelism, distribution, and concurrency 
  Virtual Machines | Managed runtime systems (e.g., JVM, Android Runtime (ART), V8, JavaScriptCore, LLVM, .NET CLR, RPython, GraalVM, …) 
  VM design and optimization 
  VMs for mobile and embedded devices 
  VMs for real-time applications 
  Memory management and garbage collection 
  Hardware/software co-design 
  Persistence 
  Techniques, Tools, and Applications | Static and dynamic program analysis 
  Testing and debugging 
  Refactoring 
  Program understanding 
  Program synthesis 
  Security and privacy 
  Performance analysis and monitoring 
  Compiler and program verification and model checking 
  If you are unsure whether a particular topic falls within the scope of MPLR’22 or if you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to contact the Program Chair (moss at cs dot umass dot edu).  
 Submission Categories   
 MPLR accepts four types of submissions:  
 Regular research papers | , describing novel contributions involving managed language platforms. Research papers will be evaluated based on their relevance, novelty, technical rigor, and contribution to the state-of-the-art. (Format: up to 12 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix); 
  Work-in-progress research papers | , describing hot topics or promising new ideas, with perhaps less maturity than full papers. Work-in-progress papers will be evaluated with an emphasis on novelty and the potential of the new ideas instead of technical rigor and experimental results. (Format: up to 6 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix); 
  Industry and tool papers | , presenting technical challenges and solutions for managed language platforms in the context of deployed applications and systems. Industry and tool papers will be evaluated on their relevance, usefulness, and results. Suitability for demonstration and availability will also be considered for tool papers. (Format: up to 6 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix; up to 12 pages allowed if justified by the content); 
  Posters and demonstrations | , which will be evaluated similarly to work-in-progress papers. (Format: poster pdf and 1-page abstract). 
  Accepted submissions will be published in the ACM Digital Library, except if the authors prefer not to be included.  
 MPLR 2023 submissions must conform to the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions and to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy. See http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication/   
 Author Instructions   
 Submissions need to use the ACM SIGPLAN format with the sigplan  style.  
 If you are using LaTeX, submissions need to use the acmart  document class with the sigplan  option ( not  the sigconf  option). In the acmart-primary.zip  file that downloads from the LaTeX (Version 1.90) link on the https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template  page, look for samples/sample-sigplan.tex  as a guide. If you use Overleaf, be sure to change the documentclass  option manuscript  to sigplan  . For ease of reviewing, please include page numbers in your submission using the LaTeX command \settopmatter{printfolios=true}  . Please use the standard setting, e.g., the default font size for the SIGPLAN style is 10 point and the format uses two columns for the test.  
 All submissions need to be in PDF format. MPLR now uses double-blind reviewing  . Authors should not show their names on a submission and should refer to their own work in third person.  We further recommend that they avoid publicizing the work, at least under the same or similar title, while it is under review.  
 Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.  
 Submission Site: https://mplr23.hotcrp.com/   
 Important Dates   
 Paper Submission Deadline: 26 June 2023 | Extended to 29 June 2023 anywhere on Earth 
  Author response period: 25-27 July 2023

  Conference Dates: 22 October 2023 
  All deadlines are 23:59 AoE (UTC-12h).  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.
