 Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) International Conferences    
    
 The Series of Intelligent Tutoring Systems Conferences on Computer and Cognitive Sciences, Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, Gamification, Machine Learning, or Virtual Reality  .   

 ITS international conferences constitute the heart of IIS. The first ITS conference was held in Montreal in 1988.  Besides the ITS conferences, a new series of thematic and highly specialized conferences was inaugurated: The Brain Function Assessment in Learning (BFAL) series which links Intelligent Systems with Neuroscience. BFAL 2017 was the first of this conference series.

      ITS CONFERENCES   
 The Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) conference attracts researchers and academics, the industry and the end-users since 1988. It started out as an enthusiastic project by Professor Claude Frasson  and in 2018 celebrates its 30th anniversary at its birthplace in Montreal.  

 The ITS conference series enables, supports and enhances human learning, through an interdisciplinary research approach on Intelligent Systems. By linking together the study of the use of advanced computer technologies and various other themes, such as education, tutoring and etc, the ITS conference series builds the foundation for the evaluation of the use of Intelligent Systems in education, modeling innovative applications of technologies and the adaptation of systems to specific groups of learners.  
 The proceedings of the conferences are published with Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science  .  

      SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS   
 ITS papers should be original and not published or submitted to any other journal or conference  .  
  
 The ITS Proceedings are published in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science  series (LNCS) by Springer.  
   
 All paper submissions  should be made through Springer’s OCS platform  :  Authors should use the only function “submit your abstract” provided by OCS to submit their paper which includes an abstract.  
   
 Paper submissions should be in PDF  .  
  
 Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines  and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX  or for Word  , for the preparation of their paper. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs  in their paper.  
  
 All questions about submissions should be emailed to info@iis-international.org    

 ITS2025 - Generative Systems   
 The ITS2025 Conference  is about "Generative Systems" . ITS2025  presents academic and research achievements in Computer and Cognitive Sciences, AI, and Deep Learning vis-a-vis the advances of Intelligent Tutoring Systems. ITS2025 invites researchers to submit their papers.
