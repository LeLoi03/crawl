 ICLP 2023   

 The 39th International Conference on Logic Programming   
 Imperial College London, UK   
 July 9 - 15, 2023   

 The 39th International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP 2023) will take place from the 9th of July 2023 and will also mark the closing of the   Year of Prolog celebration  s   .   
 The conference will take place in  London, UK  and will be hosted by the  Department of Computing    at  I  mperial College London   .   
 Full Schedule   and   List of Speakers   
 Registration is Now Live    
 Regular papers are being released on  the TPLP journal website   (currently as FirstView).   
 Technical Communications Proceedings are  now available   .   

 Note that we offer financial support for different kinds of students (details may be found   here   ). In particular:   
 If you are a USA-based student, you may qualify for free registration and/or a stipend to offset some of your attendance costs  (courtesy of NSF) 
  If you are an undergraduate or master's student, you may qualify for free registration and/or a stipend (courtesy of Google DeepMind) 
  If you are a student (of any kind), you may qualify for financial support for accommodation and travel support (courtesy of the Artificial Intelligence journal) 

 Since the first conference held in Marseille in 1982, ICLP has been the premier international event for presenting research in logic programming. Contributions are sought in all areas of logic programming, including but not restricted to:   

 Theoretical Foundations   
 Semantics, Formalisms, Non-monotonic reasoning, Knowledge representation   

 Language Design and Programming Methodologies   
 Concurrency, Objects, Coordination, Mobility, Higher order, Meta-programming, Logic-based domain-specific languages, Programming techniques   

 Program Analysis and Optimization   
 Program analysis, Transformation, Validation, Verification, Debugging, Profiling, Testing, Execution visualization   

 Implementation Methodologies   
 Compilation, Virtual machines, Memory management, Parallel/distributed execution, Constraint handling rules, Tabling, Foreign interfaces, User interfaces.   

 Related Paradigms, Integration, and Synergies   
 Inductive and coinductive logic programming, Constraint logic programming, Answer set programming, Interaction with SAT, SMT and CSP solvers, Theorem proving, Argumentation, Probabilistic programming   

 Applications of Logic Programming   
 Databases, Big data, Data integration and federation, Software engineering, Natural language processing, Web and semantic web, Agents, Artificial intelligence, Computational life sciences, Cybersecurity, Robotics, Education   

 Tracks and Special Sessions    
  
 Besides the  main track  , ICLP 2023 will host additional special tracks:   
 Applications Track   , on  emerging and deployed applications of logic programming;   
 T  hematic  T  racks    on   
 Logic Programming and Machine Learning 
  Logic Programming and  Explainability, Ethics, and Trustworthiness 
  Recently Published Research Track   , on  important results related to logic programming that appeared recently (from January 2021 onwards) in selective journals and   conferences, but have not been previously presented at ICLP.   
 System Demonstration Track   ,   to showcase logic programming systems and implementations in a live setting.   
 Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF)  S  ession  s   , m  eant to provide an inclusive environment for informal discussions.   
 TEACHING PROLOG: THE NEXT 50 YEARS  session,  an initiative of the   Prolog Education Committee   that sprang from   Prolog'50 celebrations   .   
 ICLP2023 will  also  host a  Doctoral Consortium   ,  Tutorials  ,   a  Summer School   , a  Programming Contest   and  Workshops   .
