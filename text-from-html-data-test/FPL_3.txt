 33rd International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications  
 The International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL) was the first and remains the largest conference covering the rapidly growing area of field-programmable logic and reconfigurable computing. During the past 32 years, many of the advances in reconfigurable system architectures, applications, embedded processors, design automation methods and tools were first published in the proceedings of the FPL conference series. The conference’s objective is to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and worldwide.   
 The 33rd edition of International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL 2023) will be held in Gothenburg  from 4th to 8th  September 2023. The 2023 edition of the conference is organized by Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden.
