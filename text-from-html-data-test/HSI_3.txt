  Human Systems Integration 

 Working Group Purpose & Mission   

 Human Systems Integration (HSI) is a transdisciplinary sociotechnical and management approach to systems engineering used to ensure that a system‚Äôs technical, organizational, and human elements are appropriately addressed across the whole system lifecycle, service or enterprise system. HSI considers systems in their operational context together with the necessary interactions between and among their human and technological elements to make them work in harmony and cost-effectively, from the early design to disposal.  
 Our mission  is to ensure all design and engineering disciplines include human and socio-technical interaction and integration to enable system performance.

 Scope  

 HSI results from the convergence of Human Factors and Ergonomics  , which provides human-centred and organisation-centred evaluation techniques and tools (HCD), Information Technology  (including AI, Human-Computer Interaction, Modeling and Simulation) and System Engineering,  and the Operational Domain  of the System of Interest (Circle 3 in the figure 1).  HSI can be considered as both an enabling process  associating HCD and SE during the whole lifecycle of a system  , and a product  resulting from this process. Due to the breadth of human considerations and impacts that should be considered by a project - depending on its nature, complexity, and application area - HSI consists of a number of perspectives, such as Safety, Usability, Training, etc (see circle 2, on figure 1) These are used to help ensure that no significant human considerations are missed within requirements analysis, design, evaluation and acceptance testing, and risk management. These perspectives are not exhaustive and the degree to which they each apply will vary from project to project.  

 Figure  2  .   HSI emerges from the overlapping of three main  c  i  rcles   : (1) technology, organization, and people    
   
 within an environment at the heart; (2) examples of HSI perspectives; and (3) contributing disciplines    
   
 associated with the Operational Domain at stake in the periphery.   

 Goals  

 The HSI WG aims to demonstrate the value of HSI as an integral part of the Systems Engineering effort and to develop associated practices, resources, organizations, and training to support the Systems Engineering community's adoption of HSI.  
 Stay forefront of evolving SE practices to ensure that the presence of humans is integrated into the engineering in order to deliver successful sociotechnical systems across their life cycle. 
  Foster a community of practitioners from the contributing disciplines (System Engineering, Human Factors and Errgonomics, Information Technology, and Operational Domains) and develop a common framework. 

 Outcomes  

 2023   
 INCOSE EMEA WSEC

 Introduction, Guy Andr√© Boy, France 
  Society 5.0 trend, Grace Kennedy, Australia 
  Harmonizing product nature and life, Gauthier Fanmy, France 
  Aviation safety and innovation, Jean-Jacques Speyer, Belgium 
  The Ingescape solution, St√©phane Vales, France

  2022   
  HSI WG 2022 Workshop      
  The 2022 HSI Workshop was held on November 16-18, 2022 in Torrance, California, USA. With 88 participants representing 12 countries, the three-day event provided a platform for intense presentations and debates on the various activities of the HSI Working Group. The workshop brought together representatives from academia, industry, and government agencies to discuss the state of the art in HSI, including the persistent dimension of Human Machine Teaming (HMT), which combines System Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (AI)   
   
 2021   
 HSI 2021 Conference  :   
 The second INCOSE HSI conference,   
  HSI2021was held virtually from 16 to 19 November, 2021. The conference brought industry and academia working together with the International Ergonomics Association (IEA) and Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).    
 Write-up of the first draft of the HSI Chapter for the 5th edition of the SE Handbook (delivered early 2021)  
 Work in progress on an HSI guideline document Active participation at IW2021 (3 sessions of 3 hours each)  
 2020   
 The signing of the MOU between INCOSE and IEA (International Ergonomics Association) in November 2020 is a historical milestone.  
 HSI WG 2022 Workshops :   In 2020, The HSI WG organized three workshops (January in California; April in Germany (virtual); and October by INCOSE Israel and ESTIA Institute of Technology, France). They werevery well attended with up to 350 participants and 24 countries.  
 2019   
 HSI 2019 Conference:   
  first INCOSE HSI Conference held in Biarritz, France from September 11 to 13, 2019.  

 Current Focus      
         The working group is currently finalizing its Primer. Contributions are welcome, visit the member intranet for more information.
