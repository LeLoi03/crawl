 MROL 2023  

 6 th  International Workshop on Methods, Resources and Technologies for Open Learning and Research (MROL 2023)   
 Co-located with the 18 th  International Conference on ICT  in E  ducation, R  esearch, and I  ndustrial Applications: Integration, Harmonization, and Knowledge Transfer (ICTERI 2023)  
 September 18, 2023, Vasyl Stefanyk Precarpathian National University, Ivano-Frankivsk – Ukraine http://icteri.org/icteri-2023   
 Proceedings: CEUR-WS, indexed by DBLP, Scopus, Web of Science.  
  International e-journal “Information Technologies and Learning Tools” (indexed by Web of Science)  
 MROL 2023 at a Glance   
 This Workshop is designed to consider the state of the art and potential benefit of new and emerging adaptive technologies application within the open systems of higher education. The aim is to explore the use of open education and research methods, resources and technologies for forming the creative and ICT competent person in view of European Research Area development. That have to meet the priorities of open education, open science, open communication and open data access and delivery, the wide use of cloud-based learning tools, platforms and infrastructures to support learning and research. Workshop topics are related to big data, smart data, data and resources of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), adaptive data processing and analytics, smart learning and research environments to provide effective technologies for data access and processing within the open pedagogical systems of higher education.  
 The Workshop aims at:  
 (i) Exploration and use of open education and open research tools, resources and methods for forming the creative and ICT competent person in view of European Research Area development.  
 (ii) Considering and evaluating the realization of the design and development of open systems of higher education.  
 Workshop Language: English   
 No Fees   
 The Workshop does not charge any conference fee. Participation is FREE; ICTERI 2023 sponsors cover expenses.  
 ICTERI 2023 will run in a hybrid mode  , which combines physical assembly and virtual participation for those colleagues, who are unable to attend physically due to valid reasons.  
 The Scope of MROL   
 Nowadays, an effective and promising approach to open pedagogical systems design is the use of the cloud computing technologies to provide ICT support for the functioning and development of the computer-based educational and research environment. Innovative technological solutions for learning environment organization and design using cloud computing (CC) and ICT outsourcing show promise and usefulness. The challenges of making the ICT infrastructure of the university environment fit the needs of its users, taking maximum advantage of modern network technologies, and ensuring the best pedagogical outcomes leads to the search for the most reasonable ways of its modernization.  
 The cloud-based approach is to ensure the processes of open learning giving way for broader access to quality learning resources, supporting the processes of collaborative learning and also making the learning environment available for the user practically from any place and at any time.  
 The open science processes are related to open access to research data, open discussion and analysis of research results and open communication with society. To support these processes, the corporate or hybrid cloud-based university environments are useful as the essential components (accomplishments) for the resources of the various public information networks such as research infrastructures and social networks. Thus, the analysis of the principles and essential features of the structure and design of the cloud-based learning and research university environment becomes additionally valuable because of its the open science processes support.  
 The Workshop should lead to benchmarking the state of the art and defining the future prospects of the open systems of higher education design and development, with the focus on the most valuable trends, methods, tools and technologies driving the innovative development of educational environment.  
 The learner’ competencies needed for the open educational and research systems development including higher responsibility, collaborative skills, leadership, creative thinking, taking the problem in general and others are to be considered and explored.  
 Topics of interest  include, but are not limited to:  
 Cloud-based Educational and Research Environment Design 
  ICT and Methods of Distance and Enhanced Learning 
  Smart-systems: Models, Technologies and Resources – STEM Education, Learning Robotics, Knowledge Extraction, Engineering and Management, Learning and Scientific Analytics 
  Internet of Things, Block Chain in Open Learning and Research Systems 
  Methods, Technologies and Resources for Virtual and Remote Laboratories, Virtual and Augmented Reality in Open Learning 
  ICT Competence in Open Systems Design and Development 
  Quality Assurance of ICT Education: Methods, Resources and Technologies 
  Research Infrastructures for Open Science 
  Mobile Resources and Ubiquitous Computing in Open Education 
  Multimedia, Simulation, Virtualization and Open Learning Resources 
  Data Computing for Open Education and Research etc. 
  Submission Types and Requirements   
 MROL solicits:  
 (i) Regular (full) research papers,  
  (ii) Short research papers,  
  (iii) Discussion or problem analysis papers.  
 All papers must describe the original work not previously published or submitted elsewhere, including other workshops of this conference.  
 Submission Instructions and Publication   
 The language of the Workshop is English. All submissions shall be annotated by the key words/phrases freely chosen by the authors. At least three and at most five key phrases should be provided.  
 Formatting instructions and template can be found at https://notso.easyscience.education/mrol/2023/templates  . Submissions must be made in MS Word format by using “Not So Easy Science Education Conference System”  : https://notso.easyscience.education/mrol/2023  . Please submit your paper to the ICTERI-2023 MROL Workshop.  
 The papers accepted for MROL are planned to be published online at CEUR-WS (indexed by Scopus).  
 Evaluation and Presentation   
 Every submission will be evaluated by at least three members of the MROL Program Committee. Based on evaluation results, the best papers will be accepted for their presentation at the workshop.  
 It is strongly required that at least one author of an accepted paper attends the workshop in person and presents their paper. Workshop organizers will withdraw the paper from the publication in CEUR-WS proceedings if the author(s) do not attend the workshop.
