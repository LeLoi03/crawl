  Abstract:  In this survey we discuss different state-of-the-art approaches of combining exact algorithms and metaheuristics to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Some of these hybrids mainly aim at providing optimal solutions in shorter time, while others primarily focus on getting better heuristic solutions. The two main categories in which we divide the approaches are collaborative versus integrative combinations. We further classify the different techniques in a hierarchical way. Altogether, the surveyed work on combinations of exact algorithms and metaheuristics documents the usefulness and strong potential of this research direction.

  Abstract:  We address the problem of vehicle detection and tracking for traffic monitoring in Smart City applications. We introduce a novel approach for vehicle tracking by simultaneous detection and viewpoint estimation. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is adapted to describe the vehicle’s motion when not only the pose of the object is measured, but also its viewpoint with respect to the camera. Specifically, we enhance the motion model with observations of the vehicle viewpoint jointly extracted by the detection step. The approach is evaluated on a novel and challenging dataset with different video sequences recorded at urban environments, which is released with the paper. Our experimental validation confirms that the integration of an EKF with both detections and viewpoint estimations results beneficial.

  Abstract:  The “NP-Complete” class gathers very significant practical problems such as Sat, Max-Sat, partitioning. There is not polynomial algorithm for the resolution of these problems. As a result, the interest in heuristics and meta-heuristics is still growing. In this paper, we present a very recent metaheuristic introduced to solve a 3-sat problem. This metaheuristic can be classified as an evolutionary algorithm. It is based on the process of bees' reproduction. We adapted it for the resolution of the Max-Sat problem. We tested it on a medical benchmark obtained from a data-mining problem that we translated into a Max-Sat problem.

  Abstract:  Tissue P systems with cell division is a computing model in the framework of Membrane Computing based on intercellular communication and cooperation between neurons. The ability of cell division allows us to obtain an exponential amount of cells in linear time and to design cellular solutions to NP -complete problems in polynomial time. In this paper we present a solution to the Subset Sum problem via a family of such devices. This is the first solution to a numerical NP -complete problem by using tissue P systems with cell division.

  Abstract:  This paper presents a novel method to predict times series using deep learning. In particular, the method can be used for arbitrary time horizons, dividing each predicted sample into a single problem. This fact allows easy parallelization and adaptation to the big data context. Deep learning implementation in H2O library is used for each subproblem. However, H2O does not permit multi-step regression, therefore the solution proposed consists in splitting into h forecasting subproblems, being h the number of samples to be predicted, and, each of one has been separately studied, getting the best prediction model for each subproblem. Additionally, Apache Spark is used to load in memory large datasets and speed up the execution time. This methodology has been tested on a real-world dataset composed of electricity consumption in Spain, with a ten minute frequency sampling rate, from 2007 to 2016. Reported results exhibit errors less than 2%.
