 Look forward to meeting you at ICMLC and ICWAPR 2025 in Bali, Indonesia! | 21-Nov-2024 

 Welcome to ICMLC & ICWAPR 2025   
  
  The International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics (ICMLC) is entering its 24th year while the International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition (ICWAPR) is marching towards its 22nd anniversary, we are all excited and committed to our vision: organizing good quality international conferences that provide valuable educational services to young researchers, particularly in Asia region.  
 ICMLC and ICWAPR 2025 will also offer a leading platform for participants from academia and industry to exchange and develop research ideas on Machine Learning, Cybernetics, and Wavelet Analysis, with special focus this year on adversarial learning, generative adversarial network, and uncertainty modelling.  
 In addition to keynote speakers, the two conferences offer free tutorials research consultation sessions, Lotfi Zadeh Best Paper Awards, Ph.D. Consultation, special issues of SCI indexed journals, and plenty of opportunities for you to build up your own professional network while you can come and meet with the Editors-In-Chief, IEEE Fellows and the IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society leaders.  
 Authors are invited to submit original papers that contain significant research results, development work, and innovative practices. The conferences will be held in Bali, Indonesia on 12-15 July 2025.  

  Some selected papers will be published in following journals:
