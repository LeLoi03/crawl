 Conference  
  International Conference on Information Security Practice and Experience (ISPEC) 2023  
 The ISPEC is an annual conference that brings together researchers, scholars, and practitioners to discuss emerging information security technologies, as well as their applications and integration with IT systems in many vertical areas. ISPEC has previously been held in a number of cities. Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, ISPEC 2020 has been pushed back to 2021. Springer published the conference proceedings in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series for all editions. The ISPEC 2023 conference seeks theoretical, methodological, and experimental research on information security that is original and unpublished. Original papers are being solicited from authors. Submissions must not significantly duplicate work that any of the authors has previously published elsewhere or has submitted in parallel to any other conference with a proceeding or any publication.
