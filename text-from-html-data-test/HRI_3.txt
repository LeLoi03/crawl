 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction

 «  TECoSA Seminar – Robots Gone Wrong: The role of failure in human-robot interactions 
  11th Quarterly Meeting » 

 The 18th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human Robot Interaction (HRI) takes place in Stockholm from 13-16 March.  
 The conference theme for HRI 2023 is “HRI for all” and will focus on key HRI theories, methods, designs, studies, and technical advances that aim to understand and promote inclusion and diversity in HRI. We encourage the community to consider ways to both make the field a more inclusive place for those who may not feel included, as well as to encourage inclusion within our research methods and practices.  
 Please see the HR I2023 homepage for the programme and how to register:
