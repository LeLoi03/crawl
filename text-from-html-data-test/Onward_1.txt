 Onward!  
  Symposium on New Ideas in Programming and Reflections on Software (Onward!) is a forum for new ideas and paradigms for every aspect of programming. Welcomed are papers that propose and argue for new approaches to the creation of software as well as reflections on technology and ideas bearing on programming broadly construed.

  Awards  
 Most Notable Paper Award 2024 (1) for 2011 | Recipients: Sean McDirmid 
  Title: Coding at the Speed of Touch 
  Conference: Onward! 2011 
  Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2048237.2048246 
  Citation: This 2011 Onward! paper describes the design and implementation of YinYang, a graphical system providing a proficient programming experience for tablet devices with constrained screen space. YingYang’s tile-based approach sidestepped these devices’ limited text-editing capabilities and enabled an intuitive and effective form of direct manipulation. The work stands out as an emblematic Onward! contribution. It is notable for championing programmability on a class of traditionally “closed” devices, exploring many subtle design points of graphical and visual languages, and as a call to action for moving “beyond typewriters” and inspiring the next generation of programmers. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2024 (2) for 2012 | Recipients: Andrew P. Black, Kim B. Bruce, Michael Homer and James Noble 
  Title: Grace: the Absence of (Inessential) Difficulty 
  Conference: Onward! 2012 
  Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2384592.2384601 
  Citation: In this Onward! 2012 paper, the authors distilled a tremendous effort to accommodate the needs of programming pedagogy in a new language design. The paper is a model of clarity, deftly justifying its choices while also situating Grace within the rich history of programming languages past and present. It has supported and inspired considerable follow-on work, not only on pedagogy but also in programming language research topics such as gradual typing and the semantics of object-orientation. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2023 for 2013 | Recipients: Sean McDirmid 
  Title: Usable Live Programming 
  Conference: Onward! 2013 
  Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2509578.2509585 
  Citation: This paper revitalized the study of live programming, introducing mechanisms that are now standard techniques in the field. The paper epitomizes the spirit of Onward!, asking risky questions outside the current discourse. In its form the paper was a breath of fresh air, enlivened by the use of comic strips. The work marked the beginning of a rich seam of research that has been productively mined at the ongoing LIVE workshop series at SPLASH. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2020 for 2010 | Recipients: Lennart C. L. Kats, Eelco Visser, and Guido Wachsmuth 
  Title: Pure and Declarative Syntax Definition: Paradise Lost and Regained 
  Conference: Onward! 2010 
  Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1869459.1869535 
  Citation: In a beautiful and compelling exposition, this essay lays out a research vision for realizing a declarative approach to syntax definition. Considering how we can best capture the syntactic structure of a programming language is a question near to the heart of both language design and implementation. The essay is technically interesting without getting lost in formality. Its argument for the declarative paradigm has been influential, impacting a chain of research on declarative syntax tools and helping to usher in the recent era of polyglot programming. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2019 for 2009 | Recipient: William R. Cook 
  Title: On Understanding Data Abstraction, Revisited 
  Conference: Onward! 2009 
  Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1640133 
  Citation: The 2009 Onward! essay “On Understanding Data Abstraction, Revisited” compares abstract data types and objects as two forms of data abstraction. In particular, the paper describes many points of differences and similarities between them clearly and comprehensively. The paper is not only most notable for summarizing a long history of discussions, but also for letting many programming language designers reflect on this topic again. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2018 for 2008 | Recipient: Richard P. Gabriel 
  Title: Designed as Designer 
  Conference: Onward! 2008 
  Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1449813 
  Citation: The 2008 Onward! essay “Designed as Designer” examines the nature of creativity and design, exploring poetry, architecture and software. In particular, the paper sets out to explore questions about our self-conception as computer scientists and programmers. This paper is notable for paving the way for a new track that became Essays at Onward!. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2017 for 2007 | Recipient: Sean McDirmid 
  Title: Living it up with a Live Programming Language 
  Conference: Onward! 2007 
  Paper: | http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1297073 
  Citation: The 2007 Onward! paper “Living it up with a Live Programming Language” brought the idea of Live Programming into focus by examining the necessary mechanisms, developing a good running example, displaying a contrarian attitude, and explaining it all with admirably clear writing. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2016 for 2006 | Recipient: Friedrich Steimann 
  Title: The Paradoxical Success of Aspect-Oriented Programming 
  Conference: Onward! 2006 
  Paper: | http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1167514 
  Citation: The 2006 Onward! Essay “The Paradoxical Success of Aspect-Oriented Programming” presents a considered and articulated exploration of the nature of aspect-oriented programming (AOP). In particular, the paper takes a hard look at the value proposed for AOP, together with an examination of what is achieved and what sacrifices appear to be necessary. The paper does not attack AOP, but rather takes a sober look at the hopes and the fears. In doing so, the paper provides a careful review that might also form the basis for progress, even if the form of progress might differ from the original promise. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2015 for 2005 | Recipient: Jonathan Edwards 
  Title: Subtext—Uncovering the Simplicity of Programming 
  Conference: Onward! 2005 
  Paper: | http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1094811.1094851 
  Citation: The 2005 Onward! paper “Subtext—Uncovering the Simplicity of Programming” presented a new kind of programming, unifying programs and their execution, and which helped establish Onward! as a forum for high-end, lateral thinking about programming. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2014 for 2004 | Recipient: Tim Sheard 
  Title: Languages of the Future 
  Conference: Onward! 2004 
  Paper: | http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1052883.1052897 
  Citation: The 2004 Onward! paper “Languages of the Future” pioneered the idea of lightweight dependently-typed programming, and idea that has since found its way into several languages, and continues to progress today. This paper is notable for bringing together complex ideas in a compelling way; pointing to how they could be incorporated into “ordinary” languages; and influencing the practical world of software development with this pearl of a design. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2013 for 2003 | Recipient: Martin Rinard 
  Title: Acceptability-oriented Computing 
  Conference: Onward! 2003 
  Paper: | http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=949344.949402 
  Citation: The 2003 Onward! paper “Acceptability-Oriented Computing” introduced the approach of defining the boundaries of acceptable program behavior for a software system, and then augmenting the original system by layering components to enforce those boundaries—this instead of attempting to construct a completely error-free system. This paper led to a still-expanding series of papers exploring this approach, its capabilities and its benefits. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2012 for 2002 | Recipients: James Noble and Robert Biddle 
  Title: Notes on Postmodern Programming 
  Conference: Onward! 2002 
  Paper: | http://www.sigplan.org/sites/default/files/Onward!Proceedings-2002.pdf 
  Citation: The 2002 Onward! paper “Notes on Postmodern Programming” uses postmodern concepts to understand contemporary programming, especially as software grows in scale and design is dispersed to a diversity of stakeholders. This paper is notable because it triggered a storm of immediate responses and ongoing discussion on the Web; it introduced the essay genre to the programming community and cut the path that led to a new technical track at Onward! (Essays); and it stated for the first time the philosophical model of at-scale software development that dominates today.
