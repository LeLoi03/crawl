 Advances in Modal Logic  
  Rennes, August 22-25 2022   
   
 Advances in Modal Logic 2022  
  Rennes, August 22-25  
 Advances in Modal Logic is an initiative aimed at presenting the state of the art in modal logic and its various applications. The initiative consists of a conference series together with volumes based on the conferences.  
 Registrations are not possible any more.  
  
 Information about the AiML series can be obtained at http://www.aiml.net  .  
 AiML 2022 is co-located with the Workshop on Logical Aspects of Multi-Agent Systems and Strategic Reasoning ( LAMAS&SR 2022  ) in IRISA  .  
 About COVID-19  
 Local organizers are following closely the evolution of the pandemic situation. Our preference is for a full in-person event, but we will employ an online or hybrid format according to the situation.

  Invited speakers  
  Wesley Holliday      
   
 Wesley H. Holliday is Professor of Philosophy and Chair of the Group in Logic and the Methodology of Science at the University of California, Berkeley. He earned his PhD from Stanford University in 2012, working under the supervision of Johan van Benthem and Krista Lawlor. His dissertation on epistemic logic won the E. W. Beth Dissertation Prize in 2013. At Berkeley he has worked mainly on modal and nonclassical logic, logic and natural language, logic and probability, and logic and social choice theory. Some of his papers on modal logic have appeared in AiML 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2020.  
   
  Invited talk AiML 2022 :   
  Non-classical modal logic for natural language   

  Francesca Poggiolesi      
   
 I obtained my PhD in Philosophy from the University of Florence, Italy and the University of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, France. Before joining the IHPST UMR 8590, CNRS, where I have been a permanent member since 2015, I have held research and teaching positions at the VUB, Belgium and Aix-Marseille University. I have been actively working on the proof theory for modal logic for almost ten years. More recently I have moved my interests to more philosophical notions such as grounding or explanations; I use the techniques of proof theory to attempt to provide a rigorous account of these concepts.  
   
  Invited talk AiML 2022 :   
  Explanations in Logic   

  Willem Conradie      
   
 Willem Conradie is a professor in the School of Mathematics at the  
  University of the Witwatersrand (WITS), South Africa, where is also Assistant Dean for Teaching and Learning in the Faculty of Science. Previously he was an associate professor and head of department at the University of Johannesburg. After completing the Master of Logic programme at the ILLC in 2002, he received a PhD in Mathematics from WITS in 2007 under the supervision of Valentin Goranko. His main research interests are in non-classical logics and their applications, on which he publishes regularly, with some recent contributions addressing the correspondence theory for non-distributive modal logics, new polarity and graph-based semantic for non-distributive modal logics suitable for interpretations of these formalisms as logics of categorisation systems or as hyper-constructivists logics of informational entropy and evidential reasoning, as well as new algebraic semantics for hybrid logics. Conradie has co-authored the book “Logic and Discrete Mathematics: A Concise Introduction” published by Wiley UK. He serves on the council of the South African Mathematical Society, the council of the Association for Symbolic Logic and on the South African Mathematics Olympiad committee.  
   
  Invited talk AiML 2022 :   
  On parametric phenomena in correspondence theory   

  Rineke Verbrugge      
   
 Rineke Verbrugge is a pioneer in building bridges between logic and cognitive science. She holds the chair of Logic and Cognition at the University of Groningen’s Bernoulli Institute of Mathematics, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. Verbrugge’s research spans an area covering provability logic, teamwork in multi-agent environments, and social cognition. Since her PhD on logic and the foundations of mathematics at the University of Amsterdam in 1993, Verbrugge has published more than 170 peer-reviewed international publications and a monograph, Teamwork in Multi-Agent Systems, with Barbara Dunin-Kęplicz. Verbrugge has led the NWO Vici-project “Cognitive systems in interaction: Logical and computational models of higher-order social cognition”. She is one of the six principal investigators of the Gravitation project “Hybrid Intelligence: Augmenting Human Intellect” that runs in the Netherlands in 2020-2030. Verbrugge is associate editor of the Journal of Logic, Language and Information and has been program (co-)chair of several workshops and conferences, including AiML 2020 and TARK 2023, as well as chair of the Dutch Association for Logic. Since 2021, Verbrugge is an elected member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences (KNAW).  
   
  Joint invited talk AiML & LAMAS&SR 2022  :  
  Not the sky, but the third floor is the limit: Zero-one laws for provability logic, S4, and K4
