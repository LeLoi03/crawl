 Real-Time Ray Tracing of Complex Molecular Scenes  

 Real-Time Ray Tracing of Complex Molecular Scenes   
 Abstract  

 Molecular viewing and editing tools are an important part of many applications and processes in  
  structural bioinformatics, computational chemistry, and pharmacy. Consequently, molecular  
  graphics has historically been very fast to adopt the most recent graphics technologies available.  
  Particularly important is providing the user with an accurate (3d) spatial representation of  
  molecular structural arrangements. Another important goal of molecular graphics is to create  
  publication quality images.
