   Conference Call for Papers  
 Scope  
  SAT is the premier annual meeting for researchers focusing on the theory and applications of propositional satisfiability, broadly construed. That includes Boolean optimization, such as MaxSAT and Pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints, Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF), Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), model counting, and Constraint Programming (CP) for problems with clear connections to Boolean-level reasoning. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):  
   
  Theoretical advances (including algorithms, proof complexity, parameterized complexity, and other complexity issues)  
  Practical search algorithms  
  Knowledge compilation  
  Implementation-level details of SAT solving tools and SAT-based systems  
  Problem encodings and reformulations  
  Applications (including both novel applications domains and improvements to existing approaches)  
  Case studies and reports on insightful findings based on rigorous experimentation   
 Overview  
 Top Research Topics at Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing?  
 Algorithm (13.03%) 
  Satisfiability (9.99%) 
  Theoretical computer science (9.56%) 
  The conference primarily focuses on research topics in Algorithm, Satisfiability, Theoretical computer science, Boolean satisfiability problem and Discrete mathematics. Topics in Algorithm were tackled in line with various other fields like Solver and Resolution (logic). While Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing focused on Satisfiability, it was also able to explore topics like Constraint satisfaction, Propositional calculus and Conjunctive normal form.  
 It explores research in Conjunctive normal form and the adjacent study of True quantified Boolean formula. Discrete mathematics research discussed connects with the study of Combinatorics.  
 What are the most cited papers published at the conference?  
 An Extensible SAT-solver (2493 citations) 
  Effective preprocessing in SAT through variable and clause elimination (531 citations) 
  Extending SAT Solvers to Cryptographic Problems (316 citations) 
  Research areas of the most cited articles at Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing:  
 The conference publications explore disciplines such as Algorithm, Boolean satisfiability problem, Theoretical computer science, Satisfiability and Conjunctive normal form. The most cited articles with studies in Boolean satisfiability problem featured incorporate elements of #SAT, Programming language, Combinatorics and Parallel computing. The published articles explore issues in Theoretical computer science which can be linked to other research areas like Context (language use), Solver and Resolution (logic).  
 What topics the last edition of the conference is best known for?  
 Algorithm 
  Programming language 
  Artificial intelligence 
  The previous edition focused in particular on these issues:  
 The conference generally zeroes in on subjects such as Algorithm, Combinatorics, Conjunctive normal form, Solver and Discrete mathematics. While Algorithm is the focus of it, it also provided insights into the studies of Domain (software engineering) and Mathematical proof. Class (set theory) and Upper and lower bounds are some topics wherein Combinatorics research discussed in the conference have an impact.  
 The conference facilitates discussions on Conjunctive normal form that incorporate concepts from other fields like Range (mathematics), Resolution (logic) and Algebra. Solver studies covered in it falls within the purview of Mathematical optimization. Issues in Parallel computing were discussed, taking into consideration concepts from other disciplines like Configuration space, Code (cryptography), Fuzz testing and Boolean satisfiability problem.  
 The most cited articles from the last conference are:  
 Solving and Verifying the boolean Pythagorean Triples problem via Cube-and-Conquer (110 citations) 
  Learning Rate Based Branching Heuristic for SAT Solvers (106 citations) 
  LMHS: A SAT-IP Hybrid MaxSAT Solver (38 citations) 
  Papers citation over time  
 A key indicator for each conference is its effectiveness in reaching other researchers with the papers published at that venue.  
 The chart below presents the interquartile range (first quartile 25%, median 50% and third quartile 75%) of the number of citations of articles over time.

 Publication chance based on affiliation  
 The publication chance index shows the ratio of articles published by the best research institutions at the conference edition to all articles published within that conference. The best research institutions were selected based on the largest number of articles published during all editions of the conference.  
 The chart below presents the percentage ratio of articles from top institutions (based on their ranking of total papers).Top affiliations were grouped by their rank into the following tiers: top 1-10, top 11-20, top 21-50, and top 51+. Only articles with a recognized affiliation are considered.  

 Research.com  

 During the most recent 2016 edition, 0.00%  of publications had an unrecognized affiliation. Out of the publications with recognized affiliations, 37.14%  were posted by at least one author from the top 10 institutions publishing at the conference. Another 17.14%  included authors affiliated with research institutions from the top 11-20 affiliations. Institutions from the 21-50 range included 20.00%  of all publications and 25.71%  were from other institutions.  
 Returning Authors Index  
 A very common phenomenon observed among researchers publishing scientific articles is the intentional selection of conferences they have already attended in the past. In particular, it is worth analyzing the case when the authors participate in the same conference from year to year.  
 The Returning Authors Index presented below illustrates the ratio of authors who participated in both a given as well as the previous edition of the conference in relation to all participants in a given year.

 The experience to innovation index  
 Our experience to innovation index was created to show a cross-section of the experience level of authors publishing at a conference. The index includes the authors publishing at the last edition of a conference  , grouped by total number of publications throughout their academic career (P) and the total number of citations of these publications ever received (C).  
 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups:  
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25), 
  Competent - P < 10 or C < 100 (the number of publications less than 10 or the number of citations less than 100), 
  Experienced - P < 25 or C < 625 (the number of publications less than 25 or the number of citations less than 625), 
  Master - P < 50 or C < 2500 (the number of publications less than 50 or the number of citations less than 2500), 
  Star - P ≥ 50 and C ≥ 2500 (both the number of publications greater than 50 and the number of citations greater than 2500). 

 The chart below illustrates experience levels of first authors in cases of publications with multiple authors.
