 SIGCSE TS 2025: Leading the Transformation  
   
 Welcome!   
 The Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE TS) is organized by the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) and is the organization’s flagship conference. The SIGCSE Technical Symposium addresses problems common among educators working to develop, implement and/or evaluate computing programs, curricula, and courses. The symposium provides a forum for sharing new ideas for syllabi, laboratories, and other elements of teaching and pedagogy, at all levels of instruction. The symposium provides a diverse selection of technical sessions and opportunities for learning and interaction.  
 SIGCSE TS 2025 will be held from February 26 - March 01, 2025, at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center  in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. SIGCSE TS 2025 will be primarily an in-person conference, though there will be limited online participation options.  
 Hybrid Options for 2025   
 SIGCSE TS 2025 will continue to be a hybrid event. Some aspects of the conference will be only available to in-person attendees. However, online participants will be able to participate in:  
 Keynotes 
  A selection of panels and special sessions 
  A selection of live online paper presentations 
  A selection of online tutorials 
  Nifty Assignments 
  The legendary SIGCSE Coffee Break Show 
  The online conference communication platform 
  Our hope is that this will give everyone an opportunity to present their research at the 2025 SIGCSE Technical Symposium, even if they are unable to travel, and that it will provide an affordable option to enjoy some of the symposium’s content for those that can’t attend in person. The remaining aspects of SIGCSE TS 2025—including BoFs, Demos, Lightning Talks, Posters, and the ACM Student Research Competition—will be offered only in person.   
 Authors of accepted submissions will be required to present their work in-person at the conference  , except for a limited number of papers and tutorials that are scheduled to be virtual.  
 Submission Information   
 We will be using EasyChair  for SIGCSE TS 2025.  
 We are not requiring ACM TAPS  for SIGCSE TS 2025.  
 We will be using the ACM two-column format for papers, posters, panels, special sessions, lightning talks, demos, and the ACM SRC. Tutorials and Birds-of-a-feather submissions will now use forms rather than PDFs. Nifty will continue to expect a zipped folder.

 Reviewing Information   
 To volunteer to review for SIGCSE TS 2025, please visit https://tinyurl.com/review-sigcse25  . If you are not sure whether or not you have already volunteered to review, please send email to program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  .  
 New for 2025   
 SIGCSE-Style Workshops are now called Tutorials  : We are now referring to these three-hour interactive sessions as “Tutorials”. The submission and review process will otherwise be the same as they were last year. (Explanation: We’ve heard some confusion between SIGCSE-Style Workshops and “Workshops” that are intended to be a collection of papers.)  
 New/clarified AI Policies  : Please visit the Policies on Generative AI, LLMs, and Related Tools  menu item under the Info menu for more details.  
 Clarifications on Paper Tracks  : We’ve set up a new menu item, Choosing a Track  , to provide information on which paper track might be most appropriate. Also feel free to reach out to the program chairs at program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  .  
 Earlier Deadlines  : Unfortunately, with SIGCSE TS occurring about three weeks earlier this year than last year, as well as the ever-increasing number of submissions, we have had to move the paper deadlines to mid/late July.
