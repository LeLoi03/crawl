 HPC ASIA 2023  
  
 High Performance Computing in the Asia-Pacific Region (HPC Asia)  

 WELCOME TO HPC ASIA 2023  

 High performance computing (HPC) is a key technology to solve large problems in science, engineering, and business by utilizing computing power that has been continuously evolving. The International Conference on High Performance Computing in Asia-Pacific Region (HPC Asia) is an international conference series in the Asia Pacific region on HPC technologies, fostering exchange of ideas, research results and case studies related to all issues of high performance computing.   
   
 For the first time ever, HPC Asia 2023 will be co-located with the SupercomputingAsia (SCA) conference. The conferences will be held from 27 February to 2 March 2023 in Singapore. IN addition to the paper presentations and poster sessions, HPC Asia 2023 will have a number of concurrent workshops covering topics like HPC architectures and technology, data centre efficiency and HPC-Quantum Computing integration.
