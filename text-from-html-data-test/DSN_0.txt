 On behalf of the Organizing Committee, we extend you a warm welcome to the 53rd Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2023), organized by the University of Coimbra, Portugal. Over the years DSN has become a forum to present the best world research in the fusion between dependability and security research, understanding the need to simultaneously fight against accidental faults, intentional cyber-attacks, design errors, and unexpected operating conditions. We are looking forward to a conference filled with ideas from industry and academia.
