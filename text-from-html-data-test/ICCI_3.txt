 IEEE ICCI*CC’23: Frontiers in Cognitive Computing | Cognitive Informatics | Intelligent Computing | Autonomous AI | Autonomous Learning | Autonomous Intelligence Generation @Stanford Univ.  
  May 30th, 2023  Daniela Lopez de Luise   
 ******************************************************************   
     
  2  nd     CFP (extended to June 26, 2023 upon  numerical   requests.)   
     
 We apologize if you receive multiple copies of this post.   

 ******************************************************************   
    
 Dear Colleague,  

 The IEEE ICCI*CC series  (  https://www.i2cicc.org/ieee-iccicc-series   )   is a flagship conference of its field sponsored by IEEE CS, CIS, and SMC. Following the previous 21 successful conferences on Cognitive Informatics and Cognitive Computing (ICCI’02 through ICCI*CC’22),  the   22 nd      IEEE Int’l Conference on Cognitive Informatics      and Cognitive Computing      (ICCI*CC’23, hybrids  )   focuses on themes of Autonomous AI, Cognitive Computers, Cognitive Machine Learning, Intelligent Computing, Autonomous Systems, and Cognitive Robots. ICCICC’23 welcomes researchers, practitioners, and graduate students to join the international initiative on cognitive informatics and cognitive computing toward the investigation of cognitive mechanisms and processes of human intelligence generation, brain-inspired systems, and the development of the next generation of cognitive computers and autonomous AI.   

 Research papers or special workshop/session proposals for IEEE ICCI*CC'23 are welcome  . The paper submission site is at:  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ieeeiccicc2023       .   Proceedings of ICCI*CC'23 will be published by IEEE CS Press (indexed by EI, Google Scholar, etc.). Selected papers will be recommended to be published in SCI and EI indexed transactions and journals such as IEEE SMC-Letters  and Frontiers in Computer Science  (FCS).     

 Full papers are expected to be around 6-8 pages in IEEE double column format. Short papers (4-5 pages) that report industrial experience, case studies, work in progress, or graduate students’ research are  welcome.   
   We look forward to meeting you in IEEE ICCI*CC’23 (hybrid) at  Stanford University   
    during Aug. 19-21, 2023.     Sincerely,     IEEE ICCI*CC'22 Co-Chairs
