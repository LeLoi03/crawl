  Organisation profile  
   
 Organisation profile  
 The Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science (LFCS) is one of six research institutes in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh. It was founded in 1987 and is a community of theoretical computer scientists with interests in concurrency, semantics, categories, algebra, types, logic, algorithms, complexity, databases and modelling.   
 The mainspring of research in LFCS is the study of theories which underlie, or should in future underlie, the analysis and design of computing systems. Our work has a core of theoretical research and a practical component which explores application and implementation of the theory. Several research groups exist within LFCS.
