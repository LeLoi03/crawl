 Registration Terms and Policies

 Non-Presented Paper (No Show) Policy  
 The IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS) enforces a "no show" policy. Any accepted paper included in the final program is expected to have at least one author or qualified proxy attend and present the paper at the conference. Authors of the accepted papers included in the final program who do not attend and present at the conference will be added to a "No Show List," compiled by the Society. The "no show" papers will not be published by IEEE on IEEE Xplore® or other public access forums, but these papers will be distributed as part of the on-site electronic proceedings and the copyright of these papers will belong to the IEEE.  
 Exceptions to this policy will be made by the Technical Program Co-chairs of the conference only if there is evidence that the no show occurred because of unanticipated events beyond the control of the authors, and every option available to the authors to present the paper was exhausted. The no show authors may appeal the decision of the Technical Program Co-chairs.
