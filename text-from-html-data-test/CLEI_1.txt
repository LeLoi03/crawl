 CLEI 2023: Towards an integrated and cross-cutting vision of Cybersecurity in LATAM  
 Published by admin   on 20/12/2023  20/12/2023   

 It is a satellite event on Cybersecurity, to be held in the framework of the Latin American Conference of Informatics, organised in alliance between the Latin American Centre for Informatics Studies (CLEI) and the Network of Excellence in Cybersecurity in Latin America and the Caribbean (Red CiberLaC), with the support of the Inter-American Development Bank  .  
 The cross-cutting nature of cybersecurity requires its treatment from management, teaching, research, training and awareness and practice. This is why this event aims to generate a broad exchange of knowledge and experiences, but, above all, to be a meeting place.  
 The event was held with the participation of renowned actors in the field of cybersecurity from academia, government and industry, as well as international organisations in the region. It also seeks to disseminate different relevant topics on cybersecurity, and to give visibility to the progress and development needs of the region in this field.  
 Presentations were given covering different aspects of cybersecurity. In the morning, individual presentations were given by renowned researchers in the field of public key infrastructure (PKI) and digital signatures, cybersecurity training platforms and post-quantum cryptography. In the afternoon, there were panels covering aspects of governance, interaction with civil society, standards and government cybersecurity policies.
