 Böther, Maximilian; Kißig, Otto; Weyand, Christopher Efficiently Computing Directed Minimum Spanning Trees   SIAM Symposium on Algorithm Engineering and Experiments (ALENEX) 2023: 86–95 | [ Abstract  ]  [ BibTeX  ]  [ URL  ]  [ DOI  ]  [ Download  ] | Computing a directed minimum spanning tree, called arborescence, is a fundamental algorithmic problem, although not as common as its undirected counterpart. In 1967, Edmonds discussed an elegant solution. It was refined to run in O(min(n2, m log n)) by Tarjan which is optimal for very dense and very sparse graphs. Gabow et al. gave a version of Edmonds’ algorithm that runs in O(n log n +m), thus asymptotically beating the Tarjan variant in the regime between sparse and dense. Despite the attention the problem received theoretically, there exists, to the best of our knowledge, no empirical evaluation of either of these algorithms. In fact, the version by Gabow et al. has never been implemented and, aside from coding competitions, all readily available Tarjan implementations run in O(n2). In this paper, we provide the first implementation of the version by Gabow et al. as well as five variants of Tarjan’s version with different underlying data structures. We evaluate these algorithms and existing solvers on a large set of real-world and random graphs. | @inproceedings{bother2023efficiently abstract = {Computing a directed minimum spanning tree, called arborescence, is a fundamental algorithmic problem, although not as common as its undirected counterpart.

However, the plain version of this algorithm is far too slow for real-world applications such as routing in large road networks. To amend this, many speed-up techniques have been developed that build on the idea of computing auxiliary data in a preprocessing phase, that is used to speed up the queries. One well-known example is the Arc-Flags algorithm that is based on the idea of precomputing edge flags to make the search more goal-directed. To explain the strong practical performance of such speed-up techniques, several graph parameters have been introduced. The skeleton dimension is one such parameter that has already been used to derive runtime bounds for some speed-up techniques. Moreover, it was experimentally shown to be low in real-world road networks. We introduce a method to incorporate skeletons, the underlying structure behind the skeleton dimension, to improve routing speed-up techniques even further. As a proof of concept, we develop new algorithms called SKARF and SKARF+ that combine skeletons with Arc-Flags, and demonstrate via extensive experiments on large real-world road networks that SKARF+ yields a significant reduction of the search space and the query time of about 30% to 40% over Arc-Flags. We also prove theoretical bounds on the query time of SKARF, which is the first time an Arc-Flags variant has been analyzed in terms of skeleton dimension. | @inproceedings{casel2023applying abstract = {The Single-Source Shortest Path problem is classically solved by applying Dijkstra's algorithm.

It is NP-hard and equivalent to the problem set cover. We give a branch-and-bound algorithm to solve hitting set. Though it requires exponential time in the worst case, it can solve many practical instance from different domains in reasonable time. Our algorithm outperforms a modern ILP solver, the state-of-the-art for hitting set, by at least an order of magnitude on most instances. | @inproceedings{blasius2022efficient abstract = {The hitting set problem asks for a collection of sets over a universe \(U\) to find a minimum subset of \(U\) that intersects each of the given sets.

It has delay \(O(m^{k^\ast+1} \cdot n^2)\) and uses linear space. Hereby, \(n\) is the number of vertices, \(m\) the number of hyperedges, and \(k^\ast\) the rank of the transversal hypergraph. In particular, on classes of hypergraphs for which the cardinality \(k^\ast\) of the largest minimal hitting set is bounded, the delay is polynomial. The algorithm solves the extension problem for minimal hitting sets as a subroutine. We show that the extension problem is W[3]-complete when parameterised by the cardinality of the set which is to be extended. For the subroutine, we give an algorithm that is optimal under the exponential time hypothesis. Despite these lower bounds, we provide empirical evidence showing that the enumeration outperforms the theoretical worst-case guarantee on hypergraphs arising in the profiling of relational databases, namely, in the detection of unique column combinations. | @inproceedings{blasius2019efficiently abstract = {We devise an enumeration method for inclusion-wise minimal hitting sets in hypergraphs.

 Bläsius, Thomas; Friedrich, Tobias; Katzmann, Maximilian; Krohmer, Anton Hyperbolic Embeddings for Near-Optimal Greedy Routing   Algorithm Engineering and Experiments (ALENEX) 2018: 199–208 | [ Abstract  ]  [ BibTeX  ]  [ URL  ]  [ DOI  ]  [ Download  ] | Greedy routing computes paths between nodes in a network by successively moving to the neighbor closest to the target with respect to coordinates given by an embedding into some metric space. Its advantage is that only local information is used for routing decisions. We present different algorithms for generating graph embeddings into the hyperbolic plane that are well suited for greedy routing. In particular our embeddings guarantee that greedy routing always succeeds in reaching the target and we try to minimize the lengths of the resulting greedy paths. We evaluate our algorithm on multiple generated and real wold networks. For networks that are generally assumed to have a hidden underlying hyperbolic geometry, such as the Internet graph, we achieve near-optimal results, i.e., the resulting greedy paths are only slightly longer than the corresponding shortest paths. In the case of the Internet graph, they are only \(6\%\) longer when using our best algorithm, which greatly improves upon the previous best known embedding, whose creation required substantial manual intervention. | @inproceedings{btkk2018hyperbolic abstract = {Greedy routing computes paths between nodes in a network by successively moving to the neighbor closest to the target with respect to coordinates given by an embedding into some metric space.

 Doerr, Benjamin; Friedrich, Tobias; Künnemann, Marvin; Sauerwald, Thomas Quasirandom Rumor Spreading: An Experimental Analysis   Algorithm Engineering and Experiments (ALENEX) 2009: 145–153 | [ Abstract  ]  [ BibTeX  ]  [ DOI  ]  [ Download  ] | We empirically analyze two versions of the well-known "randomized rumor spreading" protocol to disseminate a piece of information in networks. In the classical model, in each round each informed node informs a random neighbor. At SODA 2008, three of the authors proposed a quasirandom variant. Here, each node has a (cyclic) list of its neighbors. Once informed, it starts at a random position of the list, but from then on informs its neighbors in the order of the list. While for sparse random graphs a better performance of the quasirandom model could be proven, all other results show that, independent of the structure of the lists, the same asymptotic performance guarantees hold as for the classical model. In this work, we compare the two models experimentally. This not only shows that the quasirandom model generally is faster (which was expected, though maybe not to this extent), but also that the runtime is more concentrated around the mean value (which is surprising given that much fewer random bits are used in the quasirandom process). These advantages are also observed in a lossy communication model, where each transmission does not reach its target with a certain probability, and in an asynchronous model, where nodes send at random times drawn from an exponential distribution. We also show that the particular structure of the lists has little influence on the efficiency. In particular, there is no problem if all nodes use an identical order to inform their neighbors. | @inproceedings{DBLP:conf/alenex/DoerrFKS09 abstract = {We empirically analyze two versions of the well-known "randomized rumor spreading" protocol to disseminate a piece of information in networks.
