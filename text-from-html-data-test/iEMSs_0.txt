  #OSIRIS Survey on Computational Reproducibility 
  iEMSs 2026 in University College Dublin (UCD)  Dublin, Ireland   
   We are delighted to announce that the 13 th  iEMSs conference will be convened by David Ayala-Cabrera and Soumyabrata Dev at University College Dublin (UCD), Ireland.  
  
 Dr David Ayala-Cabrera is an Assistant Professor at UCD, with a focus on civil engineering and environmental modelling. His research is dedicated to advancing sustainable infrastructure and improving water resource management. | Dr Soumyabrata Dev is an Assistant Professor at UCD, specialising in machine learning, computer vision, and remote sensing. His work is at the forefront of applying artificial intelligence to address pressing global challenges, including climate change and environmental monitoring. 
  
  UCD is Ireland’s largest university, blending over 160 years of history with modern facilities. The conference venue will be O’Reilly Hall within the main campus within Dublin City. Dublin is well connected to direct routes from Europe and North America and the city is well-served by public transportation. The conference location will offer a good range of accommodation options ranging from university halls to near-by hotels.  
 We anticipate that Dublin and Ireland will be an attractive destination for Society members. The Irish are world renowned for their hospitality and Dublin is a city of contrasts, blending historic charm with modern sophistication.  
 Conference dates are yet to be confirmed (our preferred dates are waitlisted) but will be in late June or July. Please look out for an announcement soon!  
 We look forward to seeing you in Dublin!  

 iEMSs 2024 at Michigan State University in East Lansing, USA   
 From 23 to 27 June 2024, we gathered on the Michigan State University  (MSU) campus in East Lansing to hold our 12 th  biennial conference with the overarching motto “Addressing Global Environmental Challenges Through Intelligent Modelling”  . Our MSU colleagues had set up a great event with short connections between the meeting rooms and accommodation, and we were delighted to welcome more than 180 participants from 21 countries. On Sunday evening, we gathered for early registration and an icebreaker reception in the lovely outdoor grounds of the Kellogg Centre, and on Monday morning, we formally opened the conference with welcoming words from the MSU President and the Director of AgBioResearch  , followed by a very engaging keynote presentation by Whitney Gravelle  , President and member of the Executive Council of the Bay Mills Indian Community. Whitney focused on the most pressing environmental topics in Michigan and beyond from the perspective of an Indigenous community and the role that environmental science and modelling can play in finding solutions to these challenges.  
 Following a busy day of parallel sessions and workshops, we gathered for an opening reception. For the plenary session on Tuesday, we welcomed Barbara Robson  , Leader of the Tropical Marine Water Quality and Impacts team at the Australian Institute of Marine Science, talking about ‘Assessing model “fitness for purpose” in the context of long-term change’. After a further set of parallel sessions and workshops, the iEMSs committee on Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion met, and conference participants had the opportunity to meet the editors of SESMO  and Environmental Modelling & Software  to ask questions or discuss particular topics.  
 Our Wednesday was opened by another excellent keynote speaker, Mariana Rufino  , Chair of Livestock Systems at the Technical University of Munich, Germany. She elaborated on the topic of “Smart Grazing: digital tech and models to improve the sustainability of livestock” and gave us her insights into the role of environmental software and modelling in agriculture, with a wider view of current challenges. After more sessions and workshops, we all gathered at the MSU Football Stadium, home of the Spartans, for our banquet and used this occasion to honor our awardees of Fellowships, Early Career Research Excellence prizes and the Biennial Medals  , which had been selected as usual in the odd year (Fellowships) and earlier in 2024 (ECREs and Medals). Here, we also announced that iEMSs 2026 will tentatively be held in Dublin, Ireland, with details yet to be finalized.  
 Our final day, Thursday, started without a plenary session, and after several more parallel sessions and workshops, we gathered for a joint lunch and presented the awards for the best student presentations  before closing the 2024 iEMSs biennial conference.  

 #OSIRIS Survey on Computational Reproducibility   
 ************************************************************************************  
 Elevate science by taking part in the #OSIRIS survey on computational reproducibility!  
 The EU-funded OSIRIS project aims to provide evidence-based solutions to support reproducibility in the scientific process.  
 Computational reproducibility is an important aspect of the work. Considering the rapid development of digitalization, this survey aims to point out interesting details about recent practices, issues and challenges.  
 Researchers of the environmental modelling community are invited to contribute to the important topic of science reproducibility by filling the survey and by providing their views and insights.  
 Survey is available here: https://onlinekutatas.uni-mate.hu/index.php/617368?lang=en

 iEMSs 2024 Call for Abstracts – Deadline 19 April 2024 
  iEMSs Registration Reminder 
  iEMSs Elections 
  iEMSs 2024 Biennial Conference –   
 Abstract submissions extended to 19 April 2024   
   Call for Abstracts for iEMSs 2024  , abstracts are currently being accepted. Deadline for submission has been extended to 19 April 2024! Submit Abstracts here:  
  https://proceedings.iemss.org/index.php/2024/about/submissions   
 Session convenors: please assess all abstracts as they are submitted.  
 To enable travel decisions based on an accepted submission, please consider submitting your abstracts as soon as possible.  
 As a quick reminder and background: the iEMSs Board and Office have decided to move to a model with extended abstracts (max. 2 pages including references)  only. This is because there is substantial additional effort required to manage the review process and to ensure that conference proceedings were edited and made available online open access in an acceptable amount of time. Download figures for full conference papers, and the major hurdles of getting proceedings and full papers of a comparatively smaller conference indexed in Web of Science or Scopus did not justify that effort. In addition, we are publishing SESMO  , our full open access journal, and edit Environmental Modelling and Software  , which provide excellent outlets for full manuscripts which may emerge from iEMSs biennial conferences. Specific communications around opportunities for special issues and general submissions to both journals in the context of iEMSs 2024 as an excellent venue for publishing full manuscripts will be made in due course.  
 We will gather feedback after the 2024 conference and report back to the new Office and Board to be elected next year to review this approach in time for the 2026 conference and beyond.  
 Secondly, after working with several different conference management and abstract handling systems over the years, we have decided to invest some efforts in setting up the Open Journal System (OJS), which is used as well to publish SESMO. Along with setting up a persistent conference website as part of the iEMSs domain, the plan is to trial OJS for the 2024 conference, gather feedback and learning points, and if all goes well, we will go with this setup for all future conferences. This will have several benefits, including the ease of generating open access proceedings directly in the iEMSs online presence and close to, if not even before the actual conference. In addition, it would give abstract authors, session organisers and stream convenors the same user experience every time, without the need to adapt to a new system again and again.  
 We will be working with session organisers and stream convenors as we run this new setup for a first time in the run up to June. We may hit a bump or two and experience some hiccups, but the potential advantages operating our own setup will streamline our conference organization in the future and benefit local organisers and scientific committees going forward.
