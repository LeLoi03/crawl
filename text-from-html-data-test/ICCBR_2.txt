 Abstract  
 This volume contains the papers presented at the 31st International Conference on Case-Based Reasoning (ICCBR 2023), which was held on July 17–20, 2023, at Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. ICCBR is the premier annual meeting of the Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) research community. The theme of ICCBR 2023 was "CBR in a Data-Driven World", with the aim of considering the question "What is the role of CBR in the modern data-driven world?" The conference encouraged submissions from our invited speakers, researchers, policy makers, and practitioners in the CBR community that consider the current challenges and opportunities for CBR.
