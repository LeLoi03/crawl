 DCMI 2023, the twenty-first International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata Applications, will embrace the whole spectrum of innovation in metadata design, implementation, and best practices, with a special focus on challenges and opportunities in a data-intensive world.  
 Today's data-driven, data-dependent, and data-intensive environment requires metadata that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR), which is the underpinning of data and knowledge ecosystems.  
 Metadata has never been more crucial than today. Trending fields related to digital transformation such as connected data catalogs, collaboration and remote work, artificial intelligence and machine learning, digital history and ethics, and open science depend on high-quality metadata.  
 The parallel growth of data and metadata challenges the metadata community to rethink its research and practices in order to stay ahead of emerging trends.  
 DCMI 2023 is a venue for discussing "innovative practice" - new solutions to practical problems. It draws participants from universities, research institutions, and LAMs (libraries, archives, museums), as well as corporations, non-profit organizations, and government agencies.
