 In 2003 ATNAC was held in conjunction with the re-formation of the Australian Telecommunications CRC. The Australian Telecommunications CRC CEO, Leith Campbell, suggested that ATNAC be revived as a flagship of Telecommunications research in Australia. This new revitalised series began in 2003 and has continued uninterrupted ever since.  
 In 1996, ATNAC conferences was delivered as a joint conference with the International Switching Symposium in Sydney.  
 In 1994, ATNAC was born as an amalgamation of local conferences and symposium. The first one was held in Melbourne in 1994 with General Chair Paul Kirton from Telecom Research Labs.  
 In 1993 the last of the "Australian Teletraffic Research Seminars" was conducted at RMIT University, Melbourne Australia and at that point, Telstra management felt that there were three seminars in Australia that attracted similar people and that they would only support a combined conference which brought together the three seminars titled "Australian Teletraffic Engineering Research Seminar", "Australian Multi-media Communications, Applications & Technology Workshop" and "Australian Broadband Switching & Services Symposium". Each of these had their own separate seminar series that had been supported by Telstra and were run in Australia.  
 For approximately eight years starting in the mid-1980s, a seminar series called the "Australian Teletraffic Research Seminar" was run on an annual basis.
