 Abstract 
  PDF/EPUB 
   Preview Abstract  Unlike earlier studies that fail to measure CEO dominance accurately, our research develops a quantitative measure for CEO dominance based on a deep learning method, which can recognize the physical features from CEO’s facial photographs. Taking more than 1800 corporates’ data from 1992 to 2022 as a sample, this chapter aims to investigate the effects of CEO dominance on corporate performance. The results suggest that higher CEO dominance is associated with lower corporate performance. Furthermore, both CEO’s high non-salary compensation and large firm size significantly mitigate the negative impact of CEO dominance on corporate performance.

 Abstract 
  PDF/EPUB 
   Preview Abstract  While route recommendation plays a vital role in digital tourism services, conventional methods tend to be inherently complex, as they need to consider several constraints at once: user preferences, geographical and scheduling information, etc. Besides, recent interests from society and institutions have motivated a greater emphasis on sustainability across multiple sectors, including tourism. This work proposes to use reranking techniques as a plain and efficient method to generate personalized routes for users while considering sustainable goals in the procedure. We believe that these results could lead to new research directions regarding sustainable route recommendation techniques.

 Abstract 
  PDF/EPUB 
   Preview Abstract  Influence maximization is an important research topic in complex networks, aiming to find a seed node set with the most significant ultimate influence in social networks. Recently, the I_WVoteRank algorithm proposed a semi-local extended neighborhood concept based on the WVoteRank algorithm, considering the 1-hop and 2-hop neighbors in the voting process to calculate the voting scores of nodes. However, it initializes the voting ability of all nodes to 1. In contrast, we propose a voting method called WVoteRank++, which initializes the voting ability of nodes to their degree. This approach is significant as it considers the node’s connectivity, thus providing a more accurate representation of its influence. To reduce the time complexity, we only update the voting scores of seed nodes and their influenced neighbors within three hops. Additionally, we introduce the concept of voting proportion, which measures the percentage of votes a node casts to its neighboring nodes. This concept is crucial in our algorithm as it helps determine the influence of a node on its neighbors. We use the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered and Linear Threshold models to simulate the spreading progress on six real and synthetic datasets. The experimental results show that, in most cases, the proposed algorithm outperforms other baseline methods regarding the final infected scale, the infection scale, and the LT model.

 Abstract 
  PDF/EPUB 
   Preview Abstract  Transmission line construction is a work with high safety risks and heavy tasks. The traditional manual method for measuring line sag is influenced by objective factors, such as terrain, weather, and span, and has certain limitations in extreme environments. In addition, spacer rods are the most hardware components in transmission line construction, and the manual measurement of the installation position of conductor spacer consumes a lot of manpower. This chapter proposes a robot that can move directly on the transmission line, which can achieve measure sag value during the process of transmission line stringing construction and also can mark the installation position of the conductor spacer during the installation process. This chapter introduces the design of the structure, control system, sag measurement method, and implementation of the conductor spacer marking function. Finally, the test results of the robot on site and subsequent work are introduced.

 Abstract 
  PDF/EPUB 
   Preview Abstract  Cold start and data sparsity issues often plague traditional recommendation systems, as they only rely on rating matrices. Social recommendation systems address these issues by considering users’ social trust relationships. However, trust data is often sparse because users need more information on these supplementary resources. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new recommendation model that models the trust relationship matrix using deep neural networks. In this process, we use the sparse auto-encoder to learn latent features of the user’s trust relationships and use the learned latent features to construct the user’s neighbors. Finally, we combine the original and learned latent social relationships with the matrix factorization model. The experimental results on two datasets have validated the efficiency of this method.

   Preview Abstract  Voice recordings constitute information that enriches previous studies on mood disorders in which sensor data that measure physical activity are used. The analysis of all these data is applied to mental health to prevent crises due to depression or mania mainly. This chapter analyzes voice records and the application of machine learning for the first classification of emotions (sadness, happiness, fear, etc.). Subsequently, the emotions detected will be associated with mood states (mania, depression, mixed, euthymia, etc.). The usefulness of voice recordings to improve diagnostic prediction in the classification of mood disorders is concluded.

 Abstract 
  PDF/EPUB 
   Preview Abstract  Utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) for emotion recognition enables the direct collection of physiological signals, thereby circumventing potential deception associated with facial expressions and language cues. Concurrently, there has been a widespread adoption of deep learning techniques in this domain, aimed at achieving enhanced results through model and parameter adjustments. An innovative approach is introduced by incorporating the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for data preprocessing in conjunction with the CBi-GRU model, merging the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU). Comparative analysis underscores the significance of exploring the intrinsic characteristics of the data itself: the application of FFT not only substantially reduces processing time but also enhances model performance. The integration of CBiGRU and FFT leverages the strengths of both CNN and BiGRU methods, resulting in increased accuracy and rapid convergence.

 Abstract 
  PDF/EPUB 
   Preview Abstract  Traditional transaction systems within auto service chains exhibit several shortcomings, which are untraceable, opaque, and inefficient. To mitigate these challenges, a transaction system based on a consortium blockchain for the auto service value chain is devised to guarantee transaction authenticity and reliability. Initially, a smart contract is a computer protocol that is automatically executed. It integrates into the Byzantine fault-tolerant IBFT consensus algorithm to accomplish transactions in real time and enhance a higher degree of security. Subsequently, the IBFT is fine-tuned to enhance the consortium blockchain performance. In addition, multiple primary nodes execute the IBFT algorithm concurrently via multithreading to mitigate latency and improve throughput. Lastly, experimental results demonstrate that IBFT notably surpasses other consensus algorithms in both throughput and latency.

 Abstract 
  PDF/EPUB 
   Preview Abstract  In order to enhance the automatic inspection efficacy for cocoons, this chapter introduces a novel algorithm, named K-YOLOX, which is an augmentation of the extant YOLOX object detection framework. This innovation incorporates the distinctive features of cocoons into its operational methodology. By integrating the K-means clustering approach, the YOLOX architecture is optimized, facilitating the derivation of anchors commensurate with the cocoon dimensions. Furthermore, the algorithm’s loss function has been recalibrated, with the inclusion of the Generalized Intersection over Union (GIoU) as an additional boundary loss component, thereby significantly refining the precision of cocoon classification and localization. Empirical assessments demonstrate that the K-YOLOX algorithm achieves an average detection accuracy of 94.2% on cocoon imagery, with the comprehensive F1 score reaching 92.5%. These figures represent an enhancement of 10.3% in detection accuracy and 14.2% in the F1 metric when contrasted with the baseline YOLOX model.

 Abstract 
  PDF/EPUB 
   Preview Abstract  The new high-speed gliding aircraft combat strategy aims to adopt end-stage cooperative clusters of high-speed gliding aircraft, capable of coordinated strikes against multiple targets. Real-time planning of feasible trajectories for High speed gliding aircraft clusters is essential for synchronized control and accurate strikes. Traditional trajectory planning methods, when applied to the task of trajectory planning for large clusters of high-speed gliding aircraft, exhibit drawbacks such as lengthy computation times and difficulties in adapting to dynamic environmental changes. To address this issue, this chapter introduces a multi-objective cooperative trajectory planning method for high-speed gliding aircraft clusters based on multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradients. A pre-trained multi-agent trajectory planning model is used, which does not require recalculating trajectories for different starting positions. Detailed simulation results indicate that the proposed high-speed gliding aircraft cluster multi-objective cooperative trajectory planning method offers strong real-time planning performance and high precision in strikes.

 Abstract 
  PDF/EPUB 
   Preview Abstract  Standard contradiction separation (S-CS) rule is a novel method for automated reasoning. Subsequently, a series of algorithms have been proposed for the implementation of this automated deduction rule. In order to better realize the features of the S-CS rule, such as objective guidance and controllability, and further improve the inference performance of the S-CS algorithm, this chapter proposes a new inverse parallel deduction algorithm based on the S-CS rule. We then embed this new algorithm into Vampire, the leading automated theorem prover, forming a new parallel system called V_IP. V_IP is then evaluated using an international standard test database (e.g., the FOF theorem in CASC-J11).

 Abstract 
  PDF/EPUB 
   Preview Abstract  Quantifiers are the logical symbols in first-order languages. The basic explanation for them is as follows: universal quantifier (∀) means “for all” or “everything”; existing quantifier (∃) means “for some” or “at least one”. However, there are semantic differences in the no unique interpretation for one quantifier. After introducing the interesting semantics of quantifiers in a statement form with 1-predicate, this chapter analyzes the semantics of statement forms with two predicates, proposes ∀-conjunction and ∃-implication (∀c∃i) and ∀-implication ∃-conjunction (∀i∃c) in definition and discusses their properties by theorems, and describes the relationship between these theorems. According to the characteristics of A ∧  and E ∧  that are expansion forms of A and E in traditional logic, two trees were constructed separately; based on the chain theorem and the main relationship between ∀c∃i and ∀i∃c, it was diagrammed as a novel logical cube that is compatible with the traditional square of opposition. These works could open up a new research direction for logic and provide new tools for logic applications.

 Abstract

   Preview Abstract  Nullnorms and uninorms are used, in some contexts, to recursively aggregate random data. However, there is a possibility that, given the current value of the aggregation, an addition of a new value does not change the output. In this chapter, we focus on the probability of having an actualization when aggregating independent and identically distributed continuous random variables with idempotent nullnorms and uninorms. For idempotent nullnorms, a closed expression for the actualization probability is given and, for idempotent uninorms, an upper and a lower bound of such probability are derived. The expected number of actualizations when aggregating an infinite amount of values is also computed.

 Abstract 
  PDF/EPUB 
   Preview Abstract  Aiming at the problem of high construction cost of data set for object detection, especially in industrial application scenarios where sufficient sample images cannot be obtained from the Internet, this chapter proposes a method to automatically generate a synthetic data set .First, create and render the 3D models for the target devices to ensure that the synthetic images have a realistic patch-level feeling. Second, construct a simulation environment and then integrate the 3D models into the simulated environment based on global domain randomization. Finally, automatically annotate the label of the target objects in this synthetic image by computer graphics methods. It effectively reduces the cost of data acquisition while ensuring the detection accuracy of the model. Some current mainstream object detection models are trained with the synthetic data set. Experiments on real images show that the models trained with the synthetic images have a relatively high accuracy.

 Abstract 
  PDF/EPUB 
   Preview Abstract  Attribute reduction has the ability to identify essential features, reduce feature dimensions, and improve the classification of learning models. The study of attribute reduction methods for ordered decision systems, which are data with preferred order relations, is a popular research topic. In this chapter, a heuristic attribute reduction method based on self-information is proposed by improving the computation of the approximation set. First, by choosing the triangular matrix form, we cleverly optimize the matrix computation process, which facilitates the storage of relations among multiple objects and saves time effectively at the same time. Second, we introduce a more efficient method to compute the approximation set, which further improves the computational efficiency of the algorithm. The adoption of self-information as the uncertainty measure considers both deterministic information and possible categorization information. Finally, the validation practice on multiple datasets fully proves the effectiveness of the algorithm. From the experimental results, the algorithm in this chapter can effectively remove irrelevant or redundant attributes, and at the same time, it is also more efficient compared to other algorithms due to the improved approximation set calculation method.

This chapter points out how new concepts such as recursivity, map reducibility or hierarchy can be translated into computable aggregations.

   Preview Abstract  Overlap indices are functions measuring the fuzzy intersection between two fuzzy sets and can be built employing overlap functions, which are aggregation functions with features that provide good results when applied to practical problems, such as image processing and classification. Many studies have generalized the concept of overlap functions, such as n  -dimensional overlap functions, general overlap functions, and quasi-overlap functions, along with their application in practical problems. However, the concept of overlap index has not been nearly as extended or generalized as the one of overlap function. So, the objective of this chapter is to introduce the concepts of n  -dimensional overlap indices and general overlap indices, with special attention to the development of their construction methods based on generalized overlap functions.

 Abstract

   Preview Abstract  Supervisors and directors meet daily to review in-progress material during the production of an animated movie. These movies take years to produce, and thousands of text notes about necessary fixes are generated. These notes are manually distributed to different departments for correction. As with any manual process, many notes are not properly assigned and are never addressed, affecting the final quality of the movie. This chapter introduces a method for automatically distributing these notes using multi-class text classification with Large Language Models (LLMs). Starting with the Llama 2 7B model, we apply one-shot learning, as well as fine-tuning with QLoRA. The best results are obtained with the adapted model, achieving a mean accuracy of 0.853 in just 30 minutes of training on an RTX-3090.

We can find a wide number of studies related to the measurement of dispersion for quantitative data, however, the measurement of dispersion for qualitative data is being poorly developed despite the increasing weight in the Science of linguistic terms to manage information. In fact, only a few measures can be found within a qualitative framework, and their properties have not received much attention. In this chapter, we stress this terrible theoretical lack, exploring a desirable set of properties to be accomplished by an ordinal dispersion measure that allows a structured view of most existing ordinal dispersion measures and a better understanding of ordinal dispersion.

Therefore, this chapter focuses on anomaly detection in wind turbines using Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) vibration data. The proposed approach involves an iterative algorithm that enhances robustness and adaptability by continually adjusting thresholds through a combination of linear regression and z-score. The proposed algorithm detected 246 anomalies with a precision rate of 71.13% and an error rate of 28.87%.

 Abstract 
  PDF/EPUB 
   Preview Abstract  Trust region policy optimization (TRPO) is one of the most representative and successful policy iteration optimization algorithms, which maximizes a surrogate objective based on a generalized advantage function and importance sampling, subject to a Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence constraint between two consecutive policies. Theoretically, it is desired to improve the surrogate objective at each iteration. However, without a positive objective limit, this theoretical requirement is not always satisfied. In this chapter, we aim to find out a new TRPO formulation. According to the reciprocal optimization technique, we exchange the objective and the constraint in TRPO and then formulate a reciprocal TRPO (rTRPO). Our rTRPO is to minimize the KL divergence, subject to a minimal positive surrogate return, which could guarantee a positive improvement of the return. Further, an approximate solution is designed via a linear approximation for the return and a quadratic approximation for the KL divergence, which induces a convex quadratic programming. Our experiments on three different benchmark environments show that our proposed rTRPO is superior to three existing techniques (i.e., actor–critic algorithm, the original TRPO, and entropy regularized TRPO).

Being recommender systems popular applications that incorporate AI to a larger or lesser extent, the literature analysis identifies a research gap related to the exploration of demographic parity fairness in the group recommendation scenario. This chapter focuses on this gap, developing a group recommendation framework that has as main novelty the measuring of the consumer fairness taking into account the presence of advantaged and disadvantaged classes of users. Experimental studies are developed for measuring the performance of the proposal in a real recommendations scenario, illustrating that it is able to distinguish different fairness levels across the delivered recommendations.

 Abstract

   Preview Abstract  Scalability challenges in recommender systems refer to the difficulties that arise when maintaining systems that can handle growing datasets. On the other hand, state-of-the-art recommender systems are focusing only on increasing the number of transactions (by using evaluation metrics based on rating or ranking). However, the success of a recommender system may be reflected in business metrics, such as increased sales, revenue, user retention, or customer satisfaction. In this chapter, we aim to overcome these two challenges together: “how to define own targets (evaluation metrics) on a recommender system?” and in the meanwhile “how to scale it on big data?”. We proposed a collaborative filtering method called “TOROS: Target Oriented O  (n)  Recommender System”. TOROS reduces the similarity calculation complexity from O  (n 2   )  to O  (n)  and it has been evaluated on both publicly available datasets and also real-world e-commerce datasets of an e-commerce services provider company Frizbit S.L. We have compared TOROS with state-of-the-art recommender system algorithms and evaluated based on time and space consumption yet. As future work, we also evaluate the efficiency of TOROS in terms of various business-specific targets.

   Preview Abstract  Many weighting methods based on ordinal information have been proposed by different authors within multi-attribute utility/value theory. Moreover, the literature has also addressed the possibility of considering additional information regarding the ranking of criteria, mainly focused on the strength of the differences between the weights of consecutive criteria. However, although comparison analyses have been carried out to analyze the performance of weighting methods based on ordinal information, no comparative analyses of these methods have been conducted when additional information is available. In this chapter, we compare the step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) and the cardinal sum reciprocal (CSR) using Monte Carlo simulation techniques on the basis of the hit ratio and the rank order correlation as quality measures.

 Abstract 
  PDF/EPUB 
   Preview Abstract  Bayesian optimisation, known for its minimal requirement of design parameter evaluations, is vital for global industrial process optimisation. It typically employs Gaussian processes as surrogate models for specific objectives. Traditional Bayesian optimisation is directly applied to the actual system. However, numerous industrial applications rely on simulation models. Although these models fail to represent the real system fully, they offer valuable insights to improve optimisation algorithms. A model that relies on the transfer of physical knowledge from the simulations to a Gaussian process model of the actual system is called a physics-informed Gaussian process  model. Inspired by this, this chapter proposes a novel approach called simulation-informed Gaussian process  . This approach constructs a Gaussian process kernel from simulation results to better capture design parameter-objective function correlations. This results in an accelerated Bayesian optimisation convergence of the actual system. We show this by comparing our method to conventional and physics-informed Bayesian optimisation. In addition, we offer insights into the consequences of integrating potentially misleading information into the Gaussian process framework.

It has been demonstrated that assessing turbine performance is critical to lowering operating and maintenance costs. This curve, which connects the electrical power produced by a turbine to wind speed, has been modeled and obtained using a variety of techniques. In this chapter, various probabilistic models of a wind turbine curve and the corresponding uncertainty are obtained using Gaussian process regression with different kernel functions. Specifically squared exponential, exponential and rational quadratic Gaussian models are compared. Results show how the models fit well the real data of a 2 MW wind turbine.

   Preview Abstract  The global spread of COVID-19 has prompted research on the use of mobile robotics and UV-C light to automate disinfection procedures. This attempt, however, is plagued with problems that demand nuanced solutions for successful implementation. This chapter addresses the issue by integrating a metaheuristic technique, specifically genetic algorithms, with a UV-C radiation estimator deployed along a predetermined trajectory and a mobile robot motion simulator. The primary goal is to achieve broad surface coverage with acceptable radiation levels for effective disinfection. Simultaneously, it is crucial to reduce radiation dose to conserve energy and resources while protecting the surrounding environment. The proposed solution leverages genetic algorithms for the strategic selection of waypoints, trajectory creation, radiation dose estimation, and iterative path refinement, aligning it with a predefined threshold to achieve optimal disinfection results. This chapter conclusively demonstrates that intelligent optimization significantly boosts the efficiency of the disinfection procedure across the treated area. Moreover, it ensures precision in the application of radiation within the designated space, effectively neutralizing the target microorganism and minimizing any adverse environmental impact linked to radiation exposure.

   Preview Abstract  This chapter proposes a new Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) model with spatial feature fusion for environmental sound classification. Besides data preprocessing such as spectrogram transformation and data augmentation, customized deep networks, i.e. VGG19, ResNet152, and EfficientNetB0, with additional layers, are also proposed for audio classification. Specifically, the proposed CRNN model embeds ResNet152 and EfficientNetB0 in the encoder where spatial features extracted by both networks are concatenated. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) component is used as the decoder in the proposed CRNN for temporal feature extraction. Evaluated using the ESC-50 dataset, the proposed CRNN model with a multi-channel spatial feature fusion outperforms the customized VGG19, ResNet152, and EfficientNetB0 networks as well as existing studies, significantly. The spatial feature fusion in conjunction with LSTM-based sequential feature extraction accounts for the superiority of the proposed CRNN model for environmental sound classification.

   Preview Abstract  Emails and short messages are favored for their communication efficiency. However, a substantial volume of spam is communicated even with recipient consent. To tackle such problems, models like TextCNN are employed for spam detection due to their simple network structures, swift training speed, and commendable performance. While TextCNN excels in spam classification, it has several drawbacks. For example, it utilized multi-channels with limited improvement and reduced explainability. It also lacks the capability to extract long-range features. Therefore, we introduce a novel 1D convolutional neural network, overcoming TextCNN limitations by removing channels and employing an extended kernel. We assess both the proposed and the existing TextCNN models on a large-scale mixed dataset. The empirical results indicate a superior performance of the proposed model over TextCNN with more efficient computational cost, marking a significant advancement in spam classification.

   Preview Abstract  In recent years, generative models have made remarkable progress in image synthesis, prompting concerns about potential intellectual property infringement while training. This concern focuses on the unauthorized utilization of a dataset by generative models. In order to protect the legitimate rights of dataset owners, this chapter proposes a novel approach to safeguard dataset ownership by introducing a watermark signal that generative models can memorize. To implement this, we select a subset of samples from the dataset and apply a spatial watermark to create a protected dataset comprising both water-marked and non-selected samples. Dataset owners can then detect the water-mark information in suspicious generative model outputs to determine whether the model used the protected dataset during training. The efficacy of the proposed method is validated using a VAE model on the CelebA dataset.

One such source is residual biomass, which can be used for the production of biogas through anaerobic digestion methods. To aid the adoption of green energy production, this chapter developed and implemented an open-data and remote sensing methodology for the automatic detection of crops, which should enable the corresponding estimation of their residual biomass potential through a fuzzy formulation. This chapter explores the use of neural networks jointly with RGB images taken by the Sentinel 2 satellite over different regions in Colombia. As a result, convolutional neural networks achieved a validation accuracy in the detection of crops of 97.7%, generating reliable knowledge for estimating their fuzzy potential for residual biomass production.

   Preview Abstract  The equipment operational state detection is important in modern industry for reducing production costs and improving production efficiency. However, due to the complex and continuous nature of the papermaking process, analyzing paper break faults remains challenging. This chapter proposes a paper break fault classification and identification method based on a Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) and a Softmax classifier. A stacked autoencoder model is established and trained to extract deep features from the data, and a Softmax classifier is employed to identify paper breakage faults based on the extracted features. A case study with data collected from a real paper mill demonstrates that the classification model based on SAE feature extraction and Softmax classifier can effectively achieve paper break fault recognition.

 Abstract 
  PDF/EPUB 
   Preview Abstract  Accurate prediction of highway traffic flow during holidays is crucial for traffic management and control. Traditional traffic flow prediction methods mainly rely on historical data and statistical models, which are difficult to cope with the complex and changeable traffic conditions during holidays. This chapter proposes a short-term highway traffic flow prediction method based on abductive learning for holidays. The method combines machine learning and logical reasoning, learns traffic flow features from historical data, and utilizes expert knowledge to construct logical rules to constrain and optimize the prediction results. Meanwhile, semi-supervised learning is introduced to improve the generalization ability of the model by using unlabeled data. Experimental results show that the method can effectively improve the accuracy of short-term high-way traffic flow prediction during holidays and provide reliable decision support for traffic management.

   Preview Abstract  The interval shortest path problem emerges as a variant of the shortest path problem when cost uncertainties are present, introducing a range of possible values instead of fixed costs. This variation of the problem allows an appropriate adjustment to real-world situations. However, it is important to recognize that operating with intervals is not trivial. To solve the interval shortest path problem, this chapter proposes a variation of Dijkstra’s algorithm that includes the use of either averaging functions or admissible orders. These techniques, along with the usual interval arithmetic, provide good solutions to the problem and can be adapted according to the context to best deal with the corresponding imprecision.

 Abstract

   Preview Abstract  Segregation is a phenomenon that has been widely studied in the social sciences, where two dimensions are intertwined: one social and the other class. However, there are no indexes that allow the use of nominal variables with more than two categories in the social dimension, leading researchers to force the use of indexes in order to adapt them to the objectives of their studies. This chapter proposes a segregation index that can be applied when the social dimension has more than two categories. The proposed indicator, chi dissimilarity index, has a behavior similar to the frequently used Duncan dissimilarity index but can be applied to problems with nominal variables in general, not only dichotomous ones. Finally, an application with real data from a school in Madrid is presented, in order to visualize its usefulness in school segregation studies.

Finally, the numerical analysis is combined to verify and expand the conclusions. The analysis finds that the increase in the cost coefficient of carbon emission reduction and the increase in loan interest rate will hurt the carbon emission reduction behavior of enterprises when they choose the strategy of timely payment and bank loans. It is worth noting that for retailers, the profit level of the just-in-time payment strategy at low-interest rates shows a temporary upward trend with the increase in interest rates.

Through hierarchical design, job tasks are subdivided into task items, job items, action items, and other subcategories in standardized format, which improves the flexibility of job sequence configuration and forms job files with complete task information. Corresponding to the hierarchy of job files, a multi-layer finite state machine software framework is designed, combined with job file information, to achieve clear interactive scheduling management of upstream and downstream multi-modules in the job process. This method solves the problems of weak adaptability, low flexibility, and complex control logic in the task flow control components and methods of power robots, and improves the reusability and portability of software functional modules. The application analysis of the autonomous operation of transmission line inspection robots shows that compared with conventional methods, this method can effectively improve the efficiency of operation process control and has good generalization ability for different types of job tasks.

The proposed recognition method has been validated through several cases of Cheongsam styles (traditional Chinese women’s costume), revealing that the network has good performance in fashion image recognition. An object detection system is constructed based on YOLOv5 model predictions, capable of recognizing cheongsam styles in dynamic and static settings. It visualizes the results of recognition, offering technical support and a reference for intelligent classification of garments.

   Preview Abstract  The study of metro flow has become a hot topic and an important research element in urban computing. Metro flow is affected by the topology of metro network and the POI around metro stations. It is a challenge to extract the effective patterns of metro flow from the complex data. In this chapter, we construct metro flow knowledge graph to depict the topological relations between metro stations, the relations between metro stations and POIs, and the relations between metro stations and flows. Since metro flow changes over time, we add the corresponding time constrain to each relation. In addition, due to the complexity of relations, the time granularity of the constraints on the relations varies. Therefore, for effective knowledge graph representation learning, we propose a multi-temporal granularity metro flow temporal knowledge graph (MGMF-TKG) embedding method. Specifically, first, we construct a metro flow temporal knowledge graph from metro flow data and use a combination of sinusoidal waves to represent temporal information. Then, a multi-time granularity knowledge graph representation learning framework is constructed to realize the representation of relations between entities under complex time information constraints. Finally, experiments are conducted using Chongqing metro flow data, and the experimental results show that the method outper-forms the benchmark methods.

   Preview Abstract  With advances in the Internet of Things and communication technologies, the diversity of edge devices has attracted excessive computational loads to these technology systems while causing device heterogeneity. In the context of mobile edge computing, differences in communication and computing resources of edge devices may affect the performance of the model. In personalized federated learning, the differences among different devices can further widen the convergence effect differences. Thus, we propose a multi-exit selection mechanism based on limited resource allocation, which allows devices with weaker computing power to end training early. Subsequently, we propose a hierarchical personalized federated learning algorithm called FedMEM, which is based on the multi-exit selection mechanism. The algorithm divides the local model into a global layer and a personalized layer, with the global layer participating in federated model aggregation while the personalized layer is retained locally. Simulation results show that compared with FedAvg and FedPre algorithms, the proposed algorithm achieves better results and considerably reduces transmission delay.

Compared to fuel vehicles, the driving motor of the electric vehicle has the mechanical characteristics of low-speed constant torque and high-speed constant power, which leads to their stronger accelerations, which also makes the development of electric vehicles face the risk of reduced riding comfort. In order to better explain this issue, this chapter starts from the human body comfort and analyzes the relationship between acceleration during the starting, breaking and turning processes of electric vehicles and the subjective feelings of the human body. Besides, an acceleration model for electric vehicles is established, which provides a detailed analysis for the riding comfort of electric vehicles.

   Preview Abstract  To mitigate unpredictable stability challenges arising from frequency coupling phenomena in voltage-source converter (VSC) systems within renewable energy sources, this chapter employs an innovative Harmonic State-Space (HSS) modeling approach based on linear time-periodic (LTP) theory. The proposed model can capture the complexities of a VSC incorporating phase-locked loop (PLL) and time-delay components. By considering the multi-frequency response properties of input and output signals, the HSS model facilitates a comprehensive analysis of the interplay among various harmonic frequencies. Through the derivation of the harmonic transfer function matrix for the VSC system, the findings unveil noteworthy harmonic coupling components evident in the non-diagonal elements. This underscores the substantial influence of harmonic coupling admittance and emphasizes potential inaccuracies in harmonic response analyses employing traditional linear time-invariant (LTI) models. Finally, the model’s precision is validated through time-domain simulations.

   Preview Abstract  Assessment methods have been used to identify the quality of procedures performed by human beings. In virtual reality simulators, user's interaction data can be collected and used by systems named Single User Assessment Systems (SUAS) in order to assess the user's performance. In particular, some procedures can be considered well performed when the same objective is achieved v times within a limited universe of attempts. In this case, the data can be modeled by a hypergeometric distribution. This chapter presents the proposal of a new fuzzy hypergeometric naive Bayes network as basis for an SUAS, which can be used in virtual reality simulators. The results showed that this new SUAS was able to achieve better results when compared to other SUASs based on different naive Bayes networks. That new proposed network can also be used for data classification and machine learning applications.  

 Etienne Kerre  obtained a Master's degree in Mathematics in 1967, and a PhD on LEED theory (Low Energy Electron Diffraction) supported by a research grant in 1970, from Ghent University, Belgium. In the early 70s he discovered a Xerox copy of Zadeh's seminal paper "Fuzzy Sets". Immediately he fell in love with and started research on fuzzy topology. Already in 1976, Etienne started some optional courses on fuzzy set theory and its applications. In the same year, he launched a research group called Fuzziness and Uncertainty Modelling that hosted many local and foreign researchers. To date, 33 students have obtained a PhD in mathematics or computer science under his guidance from Belgium, China, Bulgaria, Spain, Hungary and Egypt. Most of them have become professors in and/or continued to pursue fuzzy research. Professor Kerre's research was diversified over the years, ranging from pure mathematics to applied. He has co-authored or co-edited more than 500 papers in international journals and proceedings of international conferences. Etienne is an IFSA fellow, and was awarded the prestigious "IFSA award for significant impact on fuzzy logic related research and applications" in 2021.
