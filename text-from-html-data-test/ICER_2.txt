  ICER Conference 

 ICER Conference  
 Computing education, as a research discipline, is the study of how people come to understand computational processes and devices, and how to improve that understanding. As computation becomes ubiquitous in our world, understanding of computing in order to design, structure maintain, and utilize these technologies becomes increasingly important both for the technology professional, but also for the technologically literate citizen. The research study of how the understanding of computation develops, and how to improve that understanding, is critically important for the technology-dependent societies in which we live.  
 The International Computing Education Research (ICER) conference aims at gathering high-quality contributions to the computing education research discipline. It has been held annually since 2005 at sites around the world, and recently has been attracting an audience of over 100 computing education researchers.
