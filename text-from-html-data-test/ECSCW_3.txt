 The EUSSET Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (ECSCW)  , formerly the European Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (ECSCW), branded as “The International venue/conference on Practice-centred computing and the Design of cooperation technologies”, is a series of conferences on computer-supported cooperative work located in Europe. The conference series is affiliated with EUSSET – the European Society for Socially Embedded Technologies, part of the Social Computing Association. (Previously the conference was organized by the ECSCW Foundation and an ECSCW Conference Commmittee, resp.)  
 Starting with 2018, ECSCW is merging with COOP – International Conference on the Design of Cooperative Systems – and becomes an annual conference.
