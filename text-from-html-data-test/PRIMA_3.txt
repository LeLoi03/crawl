 I will be on special study leave in 2024. I will visit the Foundations of Cooperative AI Lab at Carnegie Mellon University led by Prof. Vincent Conitzer.   
 About Me  
 I am a Senior Lecturer  and also the Associate Head International  of the School of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, University of Adelaide  . My main research focus is algorithmic game theory  and its application to cyber security  . I am also interested in combinatorial optimisation  via neural networks  and evolutionary computation  . Prior to joining the school, I was a Lecturer in the Economics and Computation group at the University of Liverpool  , UK. I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science  from Duke University  , USA. My Ph.D. Dissertation was recognised as the runner-up for the Victor Lessor Distinguished Dissertation Award  (annual best Ph.D. Dissertation award for the field of multiagent systems worldwide). I hold a M.S. degree in Applied Mathematics  from University of Florida  , USA and a B.S. degree in Mathematics  from Zhejiang University  , China.  
  
  I have over 20 publications as lead author  in CORE A* venues such as AAAI/IJCAI/AAMAS and have served on the senior program committees of all the above conferences. Since 2022, I have led/participated in 8 research projects funded by industry partners including Cybersecurity CRC and DSTG (combined actual/projected income over 1.5 million). I currently supervise 7 active HDR students. My recent Ph.D. graduate Dr. Guanhua Wang (2022) received Dean's Commendation for Doctoral Thesis Excellence.  
  
  Over the last 5 years, I teach 5 courses per year on average, mostly on algorithms, programming, and machine learning. My SELT average is 87.3% in the last three years based on Individual Academic Profile. In terms of individual rating, for the question "Is an effective university teacher", my average rating (over 32 SELTs since 2018) is 6.08, which is higher than the average of Computer Science 5.81 and higher than the average of SET 6.03. In terms of course rating, for the question "Overall, I am satisfied with the quality of this course", my average rating (over 22 courses since 2018) is 5.81, which is also higher than the average of Computer Science 5.34 and higher than the average of ECMS 5.60.  
  
  In 2022, I am the assessment coordinator, student activity coordinator, academic integrity officer and postgraduate course advisor of our school.
