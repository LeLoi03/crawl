 The 11th ACM SIGCHI Symposium on Engineering Interactive Computing Systems  
 18-21 June, 2019 - Valencia, Spain  

 Welcome and scope  
 Welcome to the website of the 11th Engineering Interactive Computing Systems (EICS) conference. EICS 2019 is the eleventh international conference devoted to engineering usable and effective interactive computing systems. Work presented at EICS covers the full range of aspects that come into play when "engineering" interactive systems, such as innovations in the design, development, deployment, verification and validation of interactive systems. Topics of interest include the design and development of systems incorporating new interaction techniques and multimodal interaction, multi-user multi-device/screen, multi-environment interaction, mobile and pervasive systems, large-scale and big data applications deployment of interactive systems, as well as novel development methods and processes for improving the development of interactive systems.   
 EICS 2019 focuses on models, languages notations, methods, techniques and tools that support designing and developing interactive systems  . The Conference brings together people who study or practice the engineering of interactive systems, drawing from HCI, Software Engineering Requirements Engineering, Conceptual Modelling, CSCW, Ubiquitous / Pervasive Systems.  
 The conference proceedings are published by the ACM and appear in the ACM Digital Library.
