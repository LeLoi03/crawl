 About CICM -----------  
 Digital and computational solutions are becoming the prevalent means for the generation, communication, processing, storage and curation of mathematical information.  
 CICM brings together the many separate communities that have developed theoretical and practical solutions for mathematical applications such as computation, deduction, knowledge management, and user interfaces. It offers a venue for discussing problems and solutions in each of these areas and their integration.  
 The scope of CICM concerns all topics relating to intelligent computer mathematics, in particular but not limited to  
 * theorem proving and computer algebra * mathematical knowledge management * digital mathematical libraries  
 CICM 2023 Programme committee: see https://cicm-conference.org/2023/cicm.php?event=&menu=pc
