 NDSS Symposium 2023  
 The Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS) 2023 took place from 27 February – 3 March 2023 in San Diego, California.  

 Almost 500 leading academics, industry researchers, and security practitioners from around the world gathered in San Diego, California in February for the 30th edition of the Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS) to discuss the latest research and developments in Internet security research. A further 130 participants attended remotely.  
 The five-day event kicked off with keynote presentations from Richard Ford (Praetorian)  , who gave a timely opening talk on ChatGPT, and what it meant for machine learning for cybersecurity and privacy. Google’s Nina Taft  discussed the challenges faced by developers with respect to continually evolving privacy laws, policies and user preferences. The week continued with 94 paper presentations and 34 posters presentations. Alongside the main symposium, eight co-located workshops and symposia  were held, and a further 81 papers presented during these events.
