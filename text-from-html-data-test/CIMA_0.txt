 9th International Workshop on Combinations of Intelligent Methods and Applications (CIMA 2021)-2nd CFP  
  March 23rd, 2021  Daniela Lopez de Luise   
  
 ********************************************************************************     
 SUBMISSION DEADLINE EXTENDED TO 19 APRIL 2021     
 ********************************************************************************     
 9th International Workshop on     
 COMBINATIONS of INTELLIGENT METHODS and APPLICATIONS     
 (CIMA 2021)     
 (URL: http://aigroup.ceid.upatras.gr/cima2021/  )     
 in conjunction with     
 The Twelfth International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems and Applications     
 (IISA 2021)     
 12-14 July 2021, Chania, Greece     
 **********************************************************************************     
 CALL FOR PAPERS     
 *************************************************************************************     
 The combination of different intelligent methods is a very active research area     
 in Artificial Intelligence (AI). The aim is to create integrated or hybrid methods     
 that benefit from each of their components. It is generally believed that complex     
 problems can be easier solved with such integrated or hybrid methods. Some of the     
 existing efforts combine what are called soft computing methods (fuzzy logic,     
 neural networks and genetic algorithms) either among themselves or with more     
 traditional AI technologies such as logic and rules. Another stream of efforts     
 integrates case-based reasoning and machine learning with soft-computing and     
 traditional AI methods. Yet another integrates agent-based approaches with logic     
 and also non-symbolic approaches. Some of the combinations have been quite important     
 and more extensively used, like neuro-symbolic methods, neuro-fuzzy methods and     
 methods combining rule-based and case-based reasoning. However, there are other     
 combinations that are still under investigation, such as those related to the     
 Semantic Web and Deep Learning. In some cases, combinations are based on first     
 principles, but in most cases they are created in the context of specific     
 applications.     
     
 The Workshop is intended to become an annual forum for exchanging experience and     
 ideas among researchers and practitioners who are dealing with combining intelligent     
 methods either based on first principles or in the context of specific applications.     
     
 Topics of interest of the Workshop are (but not limited to):     
     
 Bayesian Networks Integrations     
 Case-Based Reasoning Integrations     
 Deep Learning Integrations     
 Ensemble learning, Ensemble methods

 analysis and emotion recognition and in Deep Learning and Logic Integrations.     
     
 PAPER SUBMISSION     
 We are interested in high quality research papers on the above or related topics.     
 Interested authors are invited to submit original contributions to the workshop.     
 The papers should be submitted through the IISA-21 submission system     
 (  https://easyconferences.eu/iisa2021/submission/   ). In the “Select Track” page,     
 choose “CIMA 2021”. In preparing your submission, follow IISA-21     
 guidelines (  https://easyconferences.eu/iisa2021/instructions-for-authors/   ). All papers     
 will be refereed by at least two members of the program committee of the Workshop.     
 Accepted papers will be presented at the Workshop sessions of the conference.     
     
 PROCEEDINGS     
 he papers of the workshop will be included in the IISA 2021 proceedings (published in     
 IEEEXplore as in previous years). After the workshop, we may issue a     
 Springer volume with extended versions of the accepted papers, after a second review round.     
     
 ATTENDANCE     
 One of the authors of each accepted paper should register for the IISA Conference     
 and present the work at the associated Workshop session of the conference. If none     
 of the authors is registered, their paper will not be presented at the Workshop and     
 will not be included in theproceedings. Registration info is available in     
 https://easyconferences.eu/iisa2021/   .     
     
 IMPORTANT DATES     
 Paper submission: 19 April, 2021     
 Acceptance notification: 10 May, 2021     
 Camera-ready: 17 May 2021
