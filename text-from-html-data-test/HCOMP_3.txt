 The 11th AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing (HCOMP 2023) was held November 6-10th at Delft University of Technology as a joint conference with the CI2023-ACM Collective Intelligence Series.  
 HCOMP serves as an invaluable platform and believes in fostering and promoting broad, interdisciplinary research in human computation and crowdsourcing. Though artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction (HCI) have been conventional cornerstones of the conference, HCOMP draws upon and contributes to various fields including human-centered qualitative studies and HCI design, social computing, artificial intelligence, economics, computational social science, digital humanities, policy, and ethics. It unites a diverse community of researchers, engineers, and practitioners, encouraging collaborative progress and innovation in this evolving discipline.
