 AIMS LATA is a conference series on theoretical computer science and its applications. LATA 2020 will reserve significant room for young scholars at the beginning of their career. It will aim at attracting contributions from classical theory fields as well as application areas. SCOPE Topics of either theoretical or applied interest include, but are not limited to: algebraic language theory algorithms for semi-structured data mining algorithms on automata and words automata and logic automata for system analysis and programme verification automata networks automatic structures codes combinatorics on words computational complexity concurrency and Petri nets data and image compression descriptional complexity foundations of finite state technology foundations of XML grammars (Chomsky hierarchy, contextual, unification, categorial, etc.) grammatical inference, inductive inference and algorithmic learning graphs and graph transformation language varieties and semigroups language-based cryptography mathematical and logical foundations of programming methodologies parallel and regulated rewriting parsing patterns power series string processing algorithms symbolic dynamics term rewriting transducers trees, tree languages and tree automata weighted automata  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2021-01-24
