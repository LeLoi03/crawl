  About the Conference & Scope  
  
 Since it started in 1989, HOT CHIPS  has been known as one of the semiconductor industry’s leading conferences on high-performance microprocessors and related integrated circuits. The conference is held once a year in August in the center of the world’s capital of electronics activity, Silicon Valley.The HOT CHIPS conference typically attracts more than 500 attendees from all over the world. It provides an opportunity for chip designers, computer architects, system engineers, press and analysts, as well as attendees from national laboratories and academia to mix, mingle and see presentations on the latest technologies and products. The three days of the conference typically feature two tutorials, two keynotes, a panel discussion and around 25 presentations on a variety of subjects related to microprocessors and integrated circuits. It is widely covered by the media; last year, we had about 25 members of the industry and national press covering the conference.Presentations at HOT CHIPS are in the form of 30-minute talks. Presentation slides are published in the HOT CHIPS proceedings and online in the archives section of the HOT CHIPS website. Participants are not required to submit written papers, but a select group are invited to submit a paper for inclusion in a special issue of IEEE Micro.The conference emphasis this year, as in previous years, is on real products and realizable technology.
