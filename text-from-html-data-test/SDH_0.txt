 Keynotes  

 Keynote 1 – Democratizing Urban Data Exploration  
 The growing ability to collect data from urban environments through a variety of sensors, coupled with a push towards openness and transparency by governments, has resulted in the availability of a plethora of spatio-temporal datasets. By analyzing these data, we have the opportunity to better understand how different urban components behave and interact over space and time, and obtain insights to make city operations more efficient, inform policies and planning, and improve the quality of life for residents. While there have been successful efforts in this direction, they are few and far between because analyzing urban data often requires a staggering amount of work: from identifying and wrangling relevant data, to performing exploratory analyses and creating predictive models. These tasks are often out of reach for domain experts that lack training in computing and data science. In this talk, I will discuss work we have done at the NYU Visualization, Imaging and Data Analysis (VIDA) Center that aims to democratize data exploration and empower domain experts to crack the code of cities by freely exploring urban data. I will present methods and systems which combine data management, analytics, and visualization to increase the level of interactivity, scalability, and usability for spatio-temporal data analyses.  
 Juliana Freire   is an Institute Professor at the Tandon School of Engineering and Professor of Computer Science and Engineering and Data Science at New York University. She served as the elected chair of the ACM SIGMOD and as a council member of the Computing Community Consortium (CCC), and was the NYU lead investigator for the Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment, a grant awarded jointly to UW, NYU, and UC Berkeley. She develops methods and systems that enable a wide range of users to obtain trustworthy insights from data. This spans topics in large-scale data analysis and integration, visualization, machine learning, provenance management, and web information discovery, as well as different application areas, including urban analytics, predictive modeling, and computational reproducibility. She is an active member of the database and Web research communities, with over 250 technical papers (including 12 award-winning papers), several open-source systems, and 12 U.S. patents. According to Google Scholar, her h-index is 65 and her work has received over 18,000 citations. She is an ACM Fellow, a AAAS Fellow, and the recipient of an NSF CAREER, two IBM Faculty awards, and a Google Faculty Research award. She was awarded the ACM SIGMOD Contributions Award in 2020. Her research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, DARPA, Department of Energy, National Institutes of Health, Sloan Foundation, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, W. M. Keck Foundation, Google, Amazon, AT&T Research, Microsoft Research, Yahoo! and IBM. She has received M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the State University of New York at Stony Brook, and a B.S. degree in computer science from the Federal University of Ceara (Brazil).  

 Keynote 2 – Harnessing Spatiotemporal Data for Pandemic Preparedness with Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs)  
 The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the importance of data for pandemic preparedness, in particular, human mobility and social interactions data that are strongly tied to the spatiotemporal spread of infectious diseases. Such data are sensitive, thus privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) become key enablers for data-driven pandemic preparedness. In this talk, I will review the landscape of PETs and their applicability for spatiotemporal data collection and analysis for pandemic preparedness. I will then highlight some of our recent and ongoing related efforts: 1) privacy-enhanced mobility trackingand contact tracing; 2) mobility data collection with local differential privacy to enable accurate mobility pattern analysis; 3) mobility data synthesization to enable downstream epidemic modeling (and other applications), and 4) federated learning to enable modeling on data distributed across institutions (and our support of the recent US-UK federated learning challenge for pandemic). I will conclude with a set of open research questions.  
 Li Xiong   is a Samuel Dobbs Professor of Computer Science and Biomedical Informatics at Emory University. She held a Winship Distinguished Research Professorship from 2015-2018. She has a Ph.D. from Georgia Institute of Technology, an MS from Johns Hopkins University, and a BS from the University of Science and Technology of China. She and her research lab, Assured Information Management and Sharing (AIMS), conduct research on the intersection of data management, machine earning, and privacy and security, with a recent focus on privacy-enhanced and trustworthy data driven AI solutions for spatial intelligence, public health, and healthcare. Her research has been supported by both government agencies including NSF, NIH, IARPA, AFOSR, and PCORI, and industry companiesincluding Mitsubishi, Kaiser Permanente, Google, Cisco, AT&T, and IBM. She is an IEEE fellow.
