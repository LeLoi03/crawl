 Abstract  
 During the SECAI supported 20th International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR2023), leading researchers from the field of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning gather to discuss their latest results. The KR conference series is the leading forum for timely in-depth presentation of progress in the theory and principles underlying the representation and computational management of knowledge. In addition, SECAI supports the co-located 36th International Workshop on Description Logics DL 2023  .  
 Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR) is a well-established and lively field of research. In KR a fundamental assumption is that an agent’s knowledge is explicitly represented in a declarative form, suitable for processing by dedicated reasoning engines. This assumption, that much of what an agent deals with is knowledge-based, is common in many modern intelligent systems. Consequently, KR has contributed to the theory and practice of various areas in AI, including automated planning and natural language understanding, and to fields beyond AI, including databases, verification, software engineering, and robotics. In recent years, KR has contributed also to new and emerging fields, including the semantic web, computational biology, cyber security, and the development of software agents.
