 New! Dependable computer systems in medicine and health care  
 In the eighteenth edition of DepCoS-RELCOMEX, we are expanding the conference scope towards the application of computer techniques and technologies in medicine and health care. Below, we have listed examples of research areas that, in our opinion, are important from the point of view of medicine and at the same time closely related to the subject of the conference.    
   
 Imaging techniques and analysis of medical images  
 Analysis of mammographic and histopathological images  
  Skin lesions and examination of thermal images  
  X-ray and ultrasonography interpretation  Computer support in medical diagnostics  
 Cancer diagnosis from histopathological data and mammography  
  Lung imaging in COVID-19 diagnostics  
  Differentiation of lung diseases based on the X-ray and ultrasonography images  Artificial Intelligence in medical diagnosis and intervention  
 Advisory medical expert systems  
  Knowledge bases and imaging of medical data sets in differentiation of diseases  
  Medical robots in diagnostics and medical interventions  
  Deep Learning and advanced classification methods in diagnostics  Medical monitoring systems  
 Monitoring of patient parameters in hospital and everyday life  
  Medical monitoring with virtual assistants  
  Augmented/virtual reality technologies in monitoring systems  
  Telemedicine  Computer aided physiotherapy  
 Virtual assistants in medical physiotherapy  
  AI in interpretation of motion capture data  
  Augmented and virtual reality in physiotherapy  General health care  
 Computer support in health care; use of cloud technologies  
  Intelligent health education systems
