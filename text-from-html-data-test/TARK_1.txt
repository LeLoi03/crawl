 28 - 30 June 2023, Nineteenth Conference on Theoretical Aspects of Rationality and Knowledge (TARK 2023), Oxford, U.K.  
    
 Date: 28 - 30 June 2023   
 Location: Oxford, U.K.   
 Target audience: CS, logic, game theory, philosophy   
 Deadline: Wednesday 15 March 2023   
 The mission of the TARK conferences is to bring together researchers from a wide variety of fields, including Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Game Theory, Decision Theory, Philosophy, Logic, Linguistics, and Cognitive Science, in order to further our understanding of interdisciplinary issues involving reasoning about rationality and knowledge. Previous conferences have been held bi-annually around the world. The information of all previous TARK conferences can be accessed at http://www.tark.org   
 Topics of interest:  
  These include, but are not limited to, semantic models for knowledge, belief, awareness and uncertainty, bounded rationality and resource-bounded reasoning, commonsense epistemic reasoning, epistemic logic, epistemic game theory, knowledge and action, applications of reasoning about knowledge and other mental states, belief revision, computational social choice, algorithmic game theory, and foundations of multi-agent systems.  
   
 Submissions are invited to TARK 2023. Extended abstracts can be submitted at: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tark2023  . Deadline for abstract registrations: March 15, 2023, anywhere on earth. Deadline for submissions: March 22, 2023, anywhere on earth.  
 Strong preference will be given to papers whose topic is of interest to an interdisciplinary audience, and papers should be accessible to such an audience. Papers will be held to the usual high standards of research publications. Extended abstracts should be no longer than 10 pages. Optional technical details such as proofs may be included in an appendix. To format your paper, please use the EPTCS LaTeX style from: http://style.eptcs.org/  . TARK reviewing is not double-anonymised, so author names can be included in the submission.
