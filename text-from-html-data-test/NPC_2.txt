 Welcome to NPC 2022     
   
 The 19 th   Annual IFIP International Conference on Network and Parallel Computing (NPC 2022) will be held in Jinan, China on  September  24-25, 2022.    
   
 The goal of NPC 2022 is to establish an international forum for engineers and scientists to present their ideas and experiences in the field of distributed and parallel computing. NPC is one of the CCF (China Computer Federation) recommended Conferences (C series, Computer Architecture/Parallel and Distributed Computing/Storage System). NPC is also a C recommended conference under the 2021 Core ranking classification system. The proceedings will be published as part of Springer LNCS. NPC 2022 is co-organized by 2022 National Annual Conference on High Performance Computing (CCF HPC China 2022). We will publish extended version of the   top papers from NPC 2022 in a special issue of the International Journal of Parallel Programming (IJPP).   
   
 NPC 2022 is the nineteenth in this series; it builds on the success of eighteen previous events of NPC in Wuhan, China (2004); Beijing, China (2005); Tokyo, Japan (2006); Dalian, China (2007); Shanghai, China (2008), Gold Coast, Australia (2009); Zhengzhou, China (2010); Changsha, China (2011); Gwangju, Korea (2012); Guiyang, China (2013); Taiwan, China (2014); New York, USA (2015); Xi'an, China (2016); Hefei, China (2017); Muroran, Hokkaido (2018); Hohhot, China (2019); Zhengzhou, China (2020) and Paris, France (2021).   

 NPC 2022 is supported by IFIP and the conference is in cooperation with IEEE Computer  Society (pending request), in particular with the Technical Committee on Parallel Processing (TCPP), the Technical Committee on Cloud Computing (TCCLD), the Special Technical Community on Multicore, and the Special Technical Community on Parallel Models and Systems: Dataflow and Beyond. These forms of cooperation started  last year with NPC 2021 in Paris (  https://npc2021.dnac.org/  ).
