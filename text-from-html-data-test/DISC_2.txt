 Welcome to the main web site of The International Symposium on DIStributed Computing (DISC)   .  
 DISC is an international symposium on the theory, design, analysis, implementation and application of distributed systems and networks. DISC is organized in cooperation with the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS)   .  
 The symposium was established in 1985 as a biannual International Workshop on Distributed Algorithms on Graphs (WDAG). The scope was soon extended to cover all aspects of distributed algorithms as WDAG came to stand for International Workshop on Distributed AlGorithms, and in 1989 it became an annual symposium. To reflect the expansion of its area of interest, the name was changed to DISC (International Symposium on DIStributed Computing) in 1998. The name change also reflects the opening of the symposium to all aspects of distributed computing. The aim of DISC is to reflect the exciting and rapid developments in this field.  
 This site was created for archiving information about all WDAGs and DISCs, organized since 1985.  
 DISC 2024  will be held in Madrid, Spain on October 28 – November 1, 2024.
