 The International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS) Administrative Committee declares its denunciation of the military action on Ukraine by Russia in disregard of territorial integrity and in violation of international law. We join institutions across the world in calling for a cessation of hostilities and for a peaceful resolution of the conflict. We send our thoughts of care and hope to our colleagues, their families and all whose lives are disrupted by this crisis.
