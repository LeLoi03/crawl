 Abstract  
   
 The Exploring Modeling Methods for Systems Analysis and Development (EMMSAD) conference series organized 29 events from 1996 to 2024, associated with Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering. In 2009, EMMSAD became a two-day working conference. Since 2017, the authors of EMMSAD’s best papers are invited to submit extended versions of their paper, for consideration to be published in the Journal of Software and Systems Modeling. The main topics of the EMMSAD series focus on models and modeling methods for the analysis and development of software information systems of any kind. These are organized into five tracks: (1) Foundations of Modeling and Method Engineering; (2) Enterprise, Business, Process, and Capability Modeling; (3) Information Systems and Requirements Modeling; (4) Domain-Specific and Knowledge Modeling; and (5) Evaluation of Models and Modeling Approaches. The aims, topics, and history of EMMSAD can be also found on its website at http://www.emmsad.org/.

 Redefine manufacturing operations for modern production environments with the help of artificial int...   
 November 2024  · The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology    
 With the rapid development of technology, the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in improving enterprise production efficiency and operational management is increasingly evident. The complexity and uncertainty in the modern manufacturing environment make it urgent for enterprises to re-examine and redefine their manufacturing operations to adapt to rapidly changing market demands. This ... [Show full abstract]  article aims to explore how to use artificial intelligence to build enterprise information systems, optimize operational management in modern manufacturing environments, improve production efficiency, reduce operating costs, and achieve intelligent decision-making. A research has been conducted on the design of an intelligent manufacturing enterprise operation management information system, including system requirement analysis, structural design, functional and database design, and system testing. A manufacturing enterprise intelligent production scheduling model has been developed to achieve efficient task management through service clustering, sales forecasting, and production scheduling execution. Optimization strategies for manufacturing operations in modern production environments include problem analysis, optimization paths, and effect evaluation. Research has shown that the constructed intelligent manufacturing operation management system can effectively integrate various business processes and improve the real-time and accuracy of data processing. Through the intelligent production scheduling model, the decision support of enterprises in sales forecasting and production scheduling has been significantly enhanced, and operational efficiency has been significantly improved.
