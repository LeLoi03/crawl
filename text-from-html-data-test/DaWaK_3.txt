 The International Conferences and Workshops on Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA)  , formerly the International Conference and Workshop(s) on Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA) and the International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA), provides a forum for presenting research results in the area of database and intelligent systems and discussions on advanced applications and issues related to these areas. It will offer the opportunity to extensively discuss requirements, problems, and solutions in the field. The conference and associated workshops will inspire a fruitful dialogue between developers in practice, users of database and expert systems, and scientists working in the field.  
 Organizer: International Organization for Information Integration and Web-based Applications & Services (@WAS; short Web Applications Society), hosted by the Institute for Telecooperation (2019-present), and the DEXA Society /Association, hosted by the Institute for Application Oriented Knowledge Processing (1990-2018). Both are institutes of the Johannes Kepler University Linz.  
 Co-located relevant recurring conferences and workshops:  
 1999 – present: | International Conference on Big Data Analytics and Knowledge Discovery (DaWaK) | The International Conference on Big Data Analytics and Knowledge Discovery, formerly the International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery (DaWaK), has become one of the most important international scientific events to bring together researchers, developers and practitioners to discuss latest research issues and experiences in developing and deploying data warehousing and knowledge discovery systems, applications, and solutions. 
  2009 – 2022: | International Workshop on Biological Knowledge Discovery from Big Data (BIOKDD) | In the recent years, there has been a rapid development of biological technologies producing more and more biological data, i.e., data related to biological macromolecules (DNA, RNA and proteins). The rise of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies, also known as high-throughput sequencing technologies, has contributed actively to the deluge of these data. In general, these data are big, heterogeneous, complex, and distributed in all over the world in databases. Analyzing biological big data is a challenging task, not only, because of its complexity and its multiple and numerous correlated factors, but also, because of the continuous evolution of our understanding of the biological mechanisms. Classical approaches of biological data analysis are no longer efficient and produce only a very limited amount of information, compared to the numerous and complex biological mechanisms under study. From here comes the necessity to adopt new computer tools and develop new in silico high performance approaches to support us in the analysis of biological big data and, hence, to help us in our understanding of the correlations that exist between, on one hand, structures and functional patterns in biological macromolecules and, on the other hand, genetic and biochemical mechanisms. Biological Knowledge Discovery from Big Data (BIOKDD), formerly the International Workshop on Biological Knowledge Discovery from Data and Data Mining, resp. (BIOKDD) is a response to these new trends. 
  2019 – 2022: | International Workshop on Machine Learning and Knowledge Graphs (MLKgraphs) | Knowledge Graphs are becoming a key technology for large-scale information processing systems containing massive collections of interrelated facts. Specifically, Knowledge Graphs provide the means for development of the newest data methods for data management, data fusion, data merging, and graph optimization and modeling, serving as a source of high quality data and a base for web-scale information integration. | The International Workshop on Machine Learning and Knowledge Graphs aims to be a meeting point for researchers and practitioners working on the latest advances in the intersection of machine learning technologies and knowledge graphs. 
  2000 – 2006: | Workshop on Theory and Applications of Knowledge Management (TAKMA) | Knowledge Management is a broad field that covers the elicitation/extraction, sharing and application of knowledge within organisations. Each of these areas has received focussed attention in separation to each other; this workshop is intended to bring together academic researchers with developers and users from the industry and public administration to share their expertise on Knowledge Management aspects that is of interest to other areas. | TAKMA Workshop Papers  2006
