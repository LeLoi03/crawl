 dc.description.abstract | This paper describes the computer architecture content in Dive into Systems, our free, online textbook that introduces a broad range of computer systems topics. Dive into Systems assumes only a CS1 background of the reader, and includes numerous examples and illustrations to foster a reader’s understanding of its content. Our textbook is designed to be used as a primary textbook for a range of courses that introduce computer systems and computer architecture topics. It also serves as a supplementary text in upper-level undergraduate and graduate level courses to provide background material on computer architecture, systems, and parallel computing. In addition to presenting the details about our book’s coverage of computer architecture topics, we also discuss the overarching themes of our textbook and our motivations for writing a free online textbook to introduce computer systems topics. Our book is currently used by more than 45 institutions in a wide range of courses, including undergraduate computer architecture courses. |
