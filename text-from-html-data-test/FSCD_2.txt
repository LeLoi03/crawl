 The FSCD  conference includes all research of the inter-related formal areas of researchers in formal structures for computation and deduction in general, and in particular all subjects that were previously covered by the RTA  and TLCA  conferences.  
 The name of the new conference comes from an unpublished but important book by Gérard Huet  that has been a strong influence on many researchers in our area. We are grateful to Gérard for allowing us to reuse the name.  
 We look very much forward to serve the scientific community with this new conference, which inherits as well as updates and modernizes the scope of the conferences it replaces. The call for papers for the next FSCD, below, give further details on the subjects of the conference.
