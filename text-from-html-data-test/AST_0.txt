  The 4th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Automation of Software Test (AST 2023)   
 Software pervasiveness in both industry and digital society, as well as the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are continuously leading to emerging needs from both software producers and consumers. Infrastructures, software components, and applications aim to hide their increasing complexity in order to appear more human-centric. However, the potential risk from design errors, poor integrations, and time-consuming engineering phases can result in unreliable solutions that can barely meet their intended objectives. In this context, Software Engineering processes keep demanding for the investigation of novel and further refined approaches to Software Quality Assurance (SQA). Software testing automation is a discipline that has produced noteworthy research in the last decade. The search for solutions to automatically test any concept of software is critical, and it encompasses several areas: from the generation of the test cases, test oracles, test stubs/mocks; through the definition of selection and prioritization criteria; up to the engineering of infrastructures governing the execution of testing sessions locally or remotely in the cloud.  
 AST continues with a long record of international scientific forums on methods and solutions to automate software testing. This year AST 2023 is the 4th edition of a conference that was formerly organized as workshops since 2006. The conference promotes high quality research contributions on methods for software test automation, and original case studies reporting practices in this field. We invite contributions that focus on: i) lessons learned about experiments of automatic testing in practice; ii) experiences of the adoption of testing tools, methods and techniques; iii) best practices to follow in testing and their measurable consequences; and iv) theoretical approaches that are applicable to the industry in the context of AST.  
 Authors of the best papers presented at AST 2023 will be invited to submit an extension of their work for possible inclusion in a special issue in Software Testing, Verification, and Reliability (STVR) journal.

 Keynote 1: Lessons from 10 Years of Automated Debugging Research   
 Track  AST 2023 (Keynotes)    
   
 Abstract  The last decade or so has seen dramatic developments in automated debugging, including fault localisation and automated program repair. This talk will look back at 10 years of my experience from working on automated debugging, starting from evolving Spectrum Based Fault Localisation, culminating to the latest work on failure reproduction using Large Language Models. We will look at how serendipitous encounters led to new ideas, how getting slightly outside your comfort zone can help you, and how best we can collaborate with industry in order to transfer our research.

 Track  AST 2023 (Keynotes)    
   
 Abstract  Software testing is one of the key activities to achieve software quality in practice. To that end, both researchers and tool builders have made considerable efforts to make software testing more efficient and more effective. We have the tools, but where do we put our money? In other words, what do we know about software engineers or software testers that actually write and execute tests? What stimulates them, what blocks them, and what do they need from tools, documentation, production code, or their team?
