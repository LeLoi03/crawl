  The Coordination, Organizations, Institutions, and Norms in Agent Systems  book series        
 The COINE Steering Committee | Multi-agent systems are often understood as complex entities where a multitude of agents interact, usually with some intended individual or collective purpose. Such a view usually assumes some form of structure  , or set of norms  or conventions  that articulate or restrain interactions in order to make them more effective in attaining those goals, more certain for participants or more predictable. The engineering of effective regulatory mechanisms is a key problem for the design of open complex multi-agent systems.  
 In recent years, social  and organizational  aspects of agency have become a major issue in MAS research. Moreover recent applications of MAS on Web Services, Grid Computing and Ubiquitous Computing enforce the need for using these aspects in order to ensure social order within these environments. Openness heterogeneity, and scalability of MAS pose new demands on traditional MAS interaction models. The view of coordination  and control  has to be expanded to consider not only an agent-centric perspective but societal  and organization-centric  views as well.  
 Following a series of very successful events in the last years, the topics of coordination  , organization  , institutions  , norms  and ethics  have become an important area of research within the agent community. The overall problem of analyzing the social, legal, economic and technological dimensions of agent organizations, and the co-evolution of agent interactions, provide theoretically demanding and interdisciplinary research questions at different levels of abstraction.  
 In order to reach different research communities working in these related topics, some of the researchers that were working in the field have decided to create the COINE  workshop series. This workshop series will provide a space for the convergence of concerns and developments from MAS researchers that have been involved with these issues from the complementary perspectives of coordination, organizations institutions and norms. Aditionally, the series will facilitate and coordinate the organization of twin yearly events co-located with large international conferences, diverse in focus and geographically.
