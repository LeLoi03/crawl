 About the Conference: |  
 LAGOS · Latin-American Algorithms, Graphs and Optimization Symposium, is the union of two Latin American Conferences on these subjects: the GRACO · Brazilian Symposium on Graphs, Algorithms and Combinatorics and the LACGA · Latin American Conference on Combinatorics, Graphs and Applications.  
   
  The first GRACO  was held in Fortaleza, Brazil, in 2001, and the second GRACO  was in Angra dos Reis, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 2005. The LACGA  was held in Santiago, Chile, in 2004. The format of these meetings was similar. The proceedings of the accepted papers were published in Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics: Volume 7  , for the first GRACO, Volume 19  for the second GRACO, and Volume 18  for LAGCA. Besides, special editions of Discrete Applied Mathematics were dedicated to these events: Volume 141  for the first GRACO, Volume 154 (13)  for LACGA, and Volume 156 (7)  for the second GRACO. |  
 Conference themes: |  
 Themes include, but are not limited to, the following AMS classification: |  
 Algorithms: analysis of algorithms; approximation algorithms; randomized algorithms; 
 Operations Research and Mathematical Programming: combinatorial optimization; integer programming; polyhedral combinatorics; operations research and management science; 
 Graph Theory: cliques, dominating and independent sets; coloring of graphs and hypergraphs; covering and packing, factorization, matching; digraphs, tournaments; graph algorithms; graphs and matrices; hypergraphs; perfect graphs; random graphs; structural characterization of types of graphs. | Algorithms: analysis of algorithms; approximation algorithms; randomized algorithms; | Operations Research and Mathematical Programming: combinatorial optimization; integer programming; polyhedral combinatorics; operations research and management science; | Graph Theory: cliques, dominating and independent sets; coloring of graphs and hypergraphs; covering and packing, factorization, matching; digraphs, tournaments; graph algorithms; graphs and matrices; hypergraphs; perfect graphs; random graphs; structural characterization of types of graphs. |
