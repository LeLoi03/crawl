 Description   
 The IEEE International Conference on Multimedia & Expo (ICME) has been the flagship multimedia conference sponsored by four IEEE societies since 2000. It aims at promoting the exchange of the latest advances in multimedia technologies, systems, and applications from both the research and development perspectives of the circuits and systems, communications, computer, and signal processing communities.  
 ICME 2023 will take place 10-14 July 2023 in Brisbane, Australia. ICME 2023 will convene leading researchers and practitioners to share the latest developments and advances in the discipline. The conference will showcase high-quality oral and poster presentations, as well as relevant Workshops sponsored by IEEE societies. An exposition of multimedia products, animations, and industries will be also held in conjunction with the conference. Moreover, in ICME 2023 exceptional papers and contributors will be selected and recognized with prestigious awards.
