 ABOUT  

 SIGGRAPH Asia 2023, Sydney  

 June Kim  

 SIGGRAPH Asia 2023 Conference Chair  
  Lecturer, The University of New South Wales   

 “SIGGRAPH Asia will be heading to Sydney for its 2023 conference and exhibition, bringing together the world’s most respected technical and creative minds, and further building New South Wales’ position as a leading global knowledge hub for creative industries!   
   
 Engaging the next generation is critical to the ongoing success for our community. Globally, there is a need to increase participation of youths, women, first peoples and people from diverse backgrounds, to study and develop skills in science, technology, engineering, arts, and design. Hosting SIGGRAPH Asia in Sydney will also provide the platform to launch new initiatives which help to scale and grow the local industry and spark interest amongst new audiences in this part of the world…   
   
 Most importantly, I would like to thank all local and international supporters who have been a great help to us in securing this opportunity, and to call on all individuals and communities to work with us to make SIGGRAPH Asia 2023 Sydney one of the most memorable and successful editions. We look forward to meeting you in Sydney in December 2023!”   
   
 Are you excited? Stay tuned on this space for more event updates!
