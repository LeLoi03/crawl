  The 22nd annual Symposium on Computer Animation (SCA) will take place in sunny Los Angeles, California from August 4 to August 6, 2023, immediately before SIGGRAPH 2023. For more than two decades now, SCA has been the premier forum for presenting innovations in the theory and practice of computer animation. Bringing together academic and industrial researchers and practitioners working in all aspects of time-based phenomena, SCA provides an intimate setting that encourages community interaction, promotes the exchange of research results, inspires future ideas, and establishes new collaborations. Conditionally accepted regular papers will undergo a second round of revision and will, upon approval, appear in the journal Proceedings of the ACM in Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques  ( PACMCGIT  ). Best Paper Awards will be given to excellent submissions that push the leading edge.
