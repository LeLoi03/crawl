  The WiMob conference is an International forum for the exchange of experience and knowledge among researchers and developers concerned with wireless and mobile technology. For eighteen years, the International WiMob conference has provided unique opportunities for researchers to interact, share new results, show live demonstrations, and discuss emerging directions in – Wireless Communication, – Wireless Networking, Mobility and Nomadicity, – Ubiquitous Computing, Services and Applications, – Green and sustainable communications and network computing and – Security on Wireless and mobile Networks.  
 WiMob 2023 will take place in Montreal, Canada, June 21 – 23, 2023.  
 WiMob 2023 is soliciting high quality technical papers addressing research challenges in the areas of wireless communications, wireless networking, mobility, nomadicity, ubiquitous computing, services and  
  applications. Papers should present original work validated via analysis, simulation or experimentation. Practical experiences and Testbed trials also are welcome.
