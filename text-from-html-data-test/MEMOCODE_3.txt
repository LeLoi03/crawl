 Post  

 In recent years, the distinction between computer system components such as hardware, software, firmware, middleware, and applications has become less clear. As a result, the MEMOCODE conference underwent a change in 2014, shifting its focus from hardware/software co-design to formal methods and models for computer system development. The aim of MEMOCODE is to highlight the significance of models and methodologies in accurate system design and development, and to create a platform for researchers and industry professionals to share ideas, research findings, and experiences in all areas of computer system development.
