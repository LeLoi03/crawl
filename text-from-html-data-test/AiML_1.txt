 22 - 25 August 2022, 14th International Conference on Advances in Modal Logic (AiML 2022), Rennes, France  
 Date: 22 - 25 August 2022   
 Location: Rennes, France   
 Deadline: Monday 7 March 2022   
 Advances in Modal Logic is an initiative aimed at presenting the state of the art in modal logic and its various applications. The initiative consists of a conference series together with volumes based on the conferences. AiML 2022 will be co-located with the Workshop on Logical Aspects of Multi-Agent Systems and Strategic Reasoning (LAMAS&SR 2022).  
 TOPICS  
 We invite submissions on all aspects of modal logic, including:  
 * history of modal logic  
  * philosophy of modal logic  
  * applications of modal logic  
  * computational aspects of modal logic (complexity and decidability of modal and temporal logics, modal and temporal logic programming, model checking, model generation, theorem proving for modal logics)  
  * theoretical aspects of modal logic (topological/algebraic/categorical perspectives on modal logic, coalgebraic modal logic, completeness and canonicity, correspondence and duality theory, many-dimensional modal logics, modal fixed point logics, model theory of modal logic, proof theory of modal logic)  
  * specific instances and variations of modal logic (description logics, modal logics over non-boolean bases, dynamic logics and other process logics, epistemic and deontic logics, modal logics for agent-based systems, modal logic and game theory, modal logic and grammar formalisms, provability and interpretability logics, spatial and temporal logics, hybrid logic, intuitionistic logic, substructural logics, computationally light fragments of all such logics)  
 Papers on related subjects will also be considered.  
 PAPER SUBMISSIONS  
 There will be two types of submissions for AiML 2022:  
 (1) Full papers for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference.  
 (2) Short presentations intended for presentation at the conference but not for the published proceedings.  
 Both types of papers should be submitted electronically using the EasyChair submission page which will be made available in due course.  
 At least one author of each accepted paper or short presentation must register for and attend the conference.  
 (1) FULL PAPERS  
 Authors are invited to submit, for presentation at the conference and publication in the proceedings, full papers reporting on original research and not submitted elsewhere. Information on the submission procedure will be made available in due course.  
 The submissions should be at most 15 pages, with an optional technical appendix of up to 5 pages, together with a plain-text abstract of 100-200 words. The submissions must be typeset in LaTeX, using the style files and template that will be provided on the AiML 2022 website in due time.  
 Authors must submit an abstract in plain text via EasyChair by the abstract deadline prior to full submission of their paper.  
 The presentations of accepted full papers will be 30 minutes long.  
 (2) SHORT PRESENTATIONS.  
 These should be at most 5 pages. They may describe preliminary results, work in progress etc., and will be subject to light reviewing. The accepted submissions will be made available at the conference, and the authors will have the opportunity to give short presentations (of up to 15 minutes) on them.
