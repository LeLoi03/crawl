 About the Conference  
 The 45th European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR) is the annual premier European forum for the presentation of new research results in the broadly conceived area of Information Retrieval. ECIR provides an opportunity for both young and established researchers to present research papers reporting new, unpublished, and innovative research results. ECIR has traditionally had a strong student focus and papers whose sole or main author is a postgraduate student or postdoctoral researcher are especially welcome. ECIR 2023 is planned to be held as a physical conference (with support for remote attendance) from the 2nd to the 6th of April 2023 in Dublin, Ireland.  
 We expect authors, PC, and the organizing committee to adhere to the ACM’s Conflict of Interest Policy  and the ACM’s Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct  .
