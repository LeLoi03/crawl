 AVI 2024 Advanced Visual Interfaces - 1st Call for Papers International Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces ================================================= 3-7 June 2024 Genoa, Italy https://avi2024.dibris.unige.it<https://avi2024.dibris.unige.it/>  ================================================= IMPORTANT DATES Long and short papers: - Abstract submission: Wednesday, January 10, 2024 - Paper submission: Wednesday, January 17, 2024 (all deadlines are 23:59, AoE) Submission webpage: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=avi2024  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- International Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces (AVI) Since 1992, AVI has been a biennial appointment for a vast international community of experts with a broad range of backgrounds. Throughout three decades, the Conference has attracted leading researchers of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) from all over the world offering a forum to present and disseminate new technological results, paradigms, and visions for HCI and user interfaces. Because of advanced technology and new possibilities for user interaction, AVI has broadened the topics it covers, still keeping its primary focus on the conception, design implementation, and evaluation of novel visual interfaces. While rooted in Italy, AVI is an actual international conference concerning the nationality of participants, authors of papers, and program committee members. The mixture of carefully selected research contributions paired with cordial Italian hospitality creates a unique conference atmosphere, which has made AVI an internationally recognized brand. AVI 2024 is under the patronage of University of Genoa, Department of Informatics Bioengineering, Robotics and Systems Engineering, Italy. We look forward to your participation in AVI 2024!

All submissions will be peer-reviewed by an international panel of experts. Accepted long and short research papers will be included in the Proceedings published by ACM Press and available in the ACM Digital Library. Long and Short papers are publications that address AVI 2024 topics and describe original unpublished research. Submissions must be anonymized. The maximum length of long papers is 8 pages (with one additional page for references). The maximum length of short papers is 4 pages (with one additional page for references). SUBMISSION FORMAT All the papers mentioned above, i.e., long and short research papers, require online submission. Authors must format submissions according to the ACM SIGCONF template. Please find the templates below: - Latex for Overleaf: https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machiner…  - Word Template: https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template  Long and short papers must be anonymized, removing information (such as authorship acknowledgments, name of an application, or software, or project) that can suggest the authors' identity. Citation to authors' previous work should not be anonymous and should be in third person in the text, e.g., "As described by [10]" and not "As described in our previous work [10]". Papers must be submitted online on EasyChair https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=avi2024  Authors are required to send a 250-word abstract by the abstract deadline, one week before final submission, to speed up the paper assignment to reviewers.
