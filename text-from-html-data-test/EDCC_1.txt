  Call For Papers   
   
 Overview The European Dependable Computing Conference is a unique forum for researchers and practitioners to present and discuss their latest research results on theory, techniques, systems, and tools for the design, validation, operation and evaluation of dependable and secure computing systems. In addition to original research papers, EDCC welcomes contributions on dependability in practice: industrial applications, experience in introducing dependability in industry, use of new or mature dependability approaches to new challenging problems or domains, etc. It will also provide a natural meeting place for the large number of projects in dependability and security, to present their state of advancement and innovative results. The conference program will be enriched by workshops, a students forum, posters, fast abstracts, and an industry track. The conference proceedings will be published by IEEE Conference Publishing Services (CPS) and will be available at IEEEXplore. The leaflet for the call for papers is now available for download on our website. To access the leaflet, simply click on the Download CFP. Topics The conference covers a broad perspective on dependability and security, which includes, but is not limited to: Hardware and software architecture of dependable systems; Fault-tolerant networks, protocols and systems; Time-sensitive networks and ultra-reliable low-latency communication; Mixed-criticality systems design and evaluation; Dependability modelling and tools; Testing and validation methods; Dependability and security of: Artificial Intelligence; Critical infrastructures, e.g. smart energy grids, intelligent vehicles, smart cities; Cyber-physical systems; (industrial) Internet of Things; Cloud, fog, and edge computing systems; Data analytics application; Databases and distributed ledgers (incl. blockchains); Safety-critical system design and analysis; Data protection and data privacy;  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2023-06-23
