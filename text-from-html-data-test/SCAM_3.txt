Abstract submission: June 29th, 2023 Paper submission: July 6th, 2023 Authors notification: August 10th, 2023 Camera Ready: August 24th, 2023 === About === The 23rd IEEE International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM) will be hosting a Replication and Negative Results (RENE) track once again in 2023. Taking advantages of nowadays open science practices, this track provides a venue for researchers to submit papers reporting (1) replications of previous empirical studies (including controlled experiments, case studies, and surveys) and (2) important and relevant negative or null results (i.e., results that failed to show an effect, but help to eliminate useless hypotheses, therefore reorienting researchers on more promising research paths) related to source code analysis and manipulation (see list of topics in Technical Research Track). *Replication studies*: Open science is key to fostering progress via transparency and empirical studies should be reproducible. However, papers in this category must go beyond simply re-implementing an algorithm and/or re-running the artifacts provided by the original paper. Such submissions should apply the approach on at least partially new data sets (open-source or proprietary). This also means that it is possible to use available infrastructures to conduct measurements and experiments but with different/extended datasets and different conditions, scenarios, etc. Replication studies can either strengthen the results of the original study by increasing external validity with additional data or provide new insights into the variables that may impact the results. A replication paper should clearly report on results that the authors were able to reproduce as well as on the aspects of the work that were irreproducible. *Negative result papers*: Due to open source and open science initiatives there are vast amounts of data and software artifacts available in repositories and online archival sites, such as GitHub and Zenodo. Not all analyses of such data and software artifacts result in expected positive results. In this category, we seek papers that report on negative results. We seek negative results for all types of software engineering research related to source code and manipulation (qualitative, quantitative, case study, experiment, etc.). Negative results are important contributions to scientific knowledge because they allow us to prune our hypothesis space. As Walter Tichy writes, "Negative results, if trustworthy, are extremely important for narrowing down the search space. They eliminate useless hypotheses and thus reorient and speed up the search for better approaches." === Open Science Policy === Since we have decided to actively support open science, we expect that replication studies clearly point out the artifacts the study is built upon, and to provide the links to all the artifacts in the submission. However, we recognize that the success of the open science initiative depends on the willingness (and possibilities) of authors to disclose their data and artifacts. Note that all submissions will undergo the same review process independent of whether authors disclose their artifacts or data. For more information about our open science policy, please visit the ICSME 2023 call for papers. === Submission Guidelines === Papers must not exceed 12 pages (the last 2 pages can be used for references only) and must conform to the IEEE proceedings paper format guidelines. Templates in Latex and Word are available on IEEE's website. All submissions must be in English and should be submitted electronically in PDF format via EasyChair. We also follow a double-blind reviewing process. Submissions must be original, in the sense that the findings and writing have not been previously published or under consideration elsewhere. The paper must be clearly marked as a RENE paper. Submissions will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. If the paper is accepted, at least one author must attend the conference and present the paper. === Program Committee === Eduardo Figueiredo (Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil) - track co-chair Quentin Stiévenart (Université du Québec à Montréal, Canada) - track co-chair Alexander Serebrenik (Eindhoven University of Technology) Andrea Stocco (Technical University of Munich) Eduardo Fernandes (University of Southern Denmark) Fabiano Ferrari (Federal University of Sao Carlos) Fiorella Zampetti (University of Sannio) Gias Uddin (University of Calgary) Gilles Perrouin (University of Namur) Jeongju Sohn (University of Luxembourg) Leandro Antonelli (Universidad Nacional de La Plata) Lingfeng Bao (Zhejiang University) Mariano Ceccato (University of Verona) Maurizio Leotta (University of Genova) Naser Jivan (Brock University) Vassilis Zafeiris (Athens University of Economics And Business) Wesley Assunção (North Carolina State University) Xiao Chen (Monash University) Zoltán Porkoláb (Eötvös Loránd University) -- Eduardo Figueiredo Associate Professor and Head of LabSoft Computer Science Department - UFMG https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~figueiredo/  http://labsoft.dcc.ufmg.br/

For the purpose of clarity "source code" is taken to mean any fully executable description of a software system. It is therefore so-construed as to include machine code very high level languages and executable graphical representations of systems. The term "analysis" is taken to mean any automated or semi automated procedure which takes source code and yields insight into its meaning. The term "manipulation" is taken to mean any automated or semi-automated procedure which takes and returns source code. We are currently accepting submissions for different tracks of the 23rd IEEE International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (IEEE SCAM 2023). Conference proceedings will be published by IEEE CS and made available through the IEEE Digital Library.
