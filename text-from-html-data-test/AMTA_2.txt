 AMTA 2023  
 Generative AI and the Future of Machine Translation  
  The Generative AI and the Future of Machine Translation ( AMTA 2023  ) took place Online on 08 November, 2023.  
 Generative AI and the Future of Machine Translation will focus on advances in cross-lingual technology and processes that leverage Large Language Models. Moving beyond the explosion of hype that began with the general availability of ChatGPT in November 2022, this event is intended as a forum for a thoughtful exchange of ideas informed by a year of successes and failures in applying Large Language Models to the challenges of cross-lingual communication and data processing.  
  Generative AI and the Future of Machine Translation included a keynote talk, expert panel discussions, presentations, tutorials for both beginners and more experienced practitioners, and demonstrations from technology providers.
