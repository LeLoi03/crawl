 Essential remarks for online presenters   
 Generally, we assume live (or real-time) presentations of contributed works.  
   
  However, for safety reasons, the presentations should be pre-recorded (20 minutes in a common video format).  
   
  Pre-recording could also be used when the real-time presentation is highly inconvenient because of the time difference.  

 26.07.2022

 WELCOME TO PPAM 2022   
 Welcome to PPAM 2022, our first in-person conference since the pandemic. Regular attendees continue to express the wish to gather in person, and we would like to honor this preference. The organizers wish to maintain the conference format used since its start in 1994, creating personal contacts and in-depth discussions.  
 In bringing everyone together under one roof, we will be strictly complying with all the safety and health measures prescribed by the Ministry of Health and the local authority.  
 The 2022 event will be held in the beautiful city of Gdansk from September 11 to September 14.   
 For those who are unable to travel, we will offer a possibility of remote participation.  
 We are committed to hosting PPAM 2022 on-site and will fulfill all the safety standards. Therefore, we strongly encourage submissions from people who plan to attend the conference in person. For those who cannot travel, we will offer the possibility of remote participation.
