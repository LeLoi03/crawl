 Call for Presentations  
 ×    
 We want to extend an invitation to participate in the upcoming 39th International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN) in Chiang Mai, Thailand. This year, we are introducing a special track that will allow researchers to present their latest research in the field of information networking. Please check below for important details.  
   
  Dates and Format:  
   
  Dates: The sessions will be on Wednesday, January 15 and Thursday, January 16, 2025.  
  Format: A lecture-style (oral) presentation. Each oral presentation will be 20 minutes long.  
   
  Submission Process and Dates:  
   
  If you are interested in presenting your paper, please submit a pdf copy of the published paper and enter information about the paper at the following EDAS link under "Call for Presentations": https://edas.info/N32446.   
   
  The pdf copy should be an original copy downloaded from the publisher (i.e., IEEE, ACM, Elsevier, etc.). So, you do not need to reformat your published paper. Please ignore formatting errors when you are submitting to EDAS.  
   
  Timeline:  
   
  Nov. 29 - Deadline to submit to EDAS  
  Dec. 6 - Presenter notification  
  Dec. 20 - Deadline to register for the conference  
   
  Eligibility Guidelines and Procedures:  
   
  Only authors whose papers were published on and after Jan. 1, 2024, are eligible to present their work, and the presentation must cover the same contribution as the original paper.  
   
  Acceptance into this track will result in an opportunity to present at the conference but will not result in an additional publication.  
   
  If more authors express interest than can be accommodated in the program, papers will be evaluated to be selected for presentation. The TPC chairs will use several factors, including the topic of the paper and the number of downloads/citations, in the selection process.  
   
  If your paper is selected for presentation, you will be expected to register for the conference at an applicable author rate (“Full” or “Limited”). Visa letters will be provided to authors who need them.  
   
  The paper may only be presented in person by the author; no remote or pre-recorded presentations are permitted for this track.  
   
  We are excited to receive your contribution and hope to see you in Chiang Mai for an engaging exchange of ideas.
