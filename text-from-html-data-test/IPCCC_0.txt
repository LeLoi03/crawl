 The International Performance, Computing, and Communications Conference is a premier IEEE conference presenting research in the performance of computer and communication systems. For over four decades, IPCCC has been a research forum for academic, industrial, and government researchers. We encourage submission of high-quality papers reporting original work in both theoretical and experimental research areas. This year, IPCCC will be utilizing IEEE Open Preview  to allow the conference proceedings to be available in the IEEE Xplore  ® Digital Library  and conference mobile app (if applicable), free of charge to all IEEE Xplore  ® customers, prior to the conference start date.  
  All papers should be submitted at https://edas.info/N30755  . The following types of papers are accepted for submission:  
 Regular Paper: | 8 pages without extra charge, and up to 2 extra pages at $100 per extra page. 
  Short Paper: | 6 pages without extra charge, and up to 2 extra page at $100 per extra page. 
  Poster Abstract Paper: | 2 pages. No extra pages are available. Posters are encouraged from students to present their work in progress as a poster at the conference.
