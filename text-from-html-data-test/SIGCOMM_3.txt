 Computer network 
  Operating system 
  The Internet 
  The previous edition focused in particular on these issues:  
 The conference was organized to reinforce research efforts on Computer network, Network packet, Distributed computing, The Internet and Key (cryptography). ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication focuses on Computer network as well as the interrelated topic of Throughput. The conference focused on Network packet research but expanded to cover Central processing unit.  
 Topics in Distributed computing were tackled in line with various other fields like Artificial neural network, Quality of service, Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution and Topology (electrical circuits). The conference explores topics in The Internet which can be helpful for research in disciplines like Computer security, Software deployment, Architecture and Internet privacy. Forwarding plane research in it involves the investigation of Scalability studies, all of which are linked to disciplines such as Artificial intelligence.  
 The most cited articles from the last conference are:  
 Efficient sparse collective communication and its application to accelerate distributed deep learning (5 citations) 
  Verifying learning-augmented systems (3 citations) 
  The ties that un-bind: decoupling IP from web services and sockets for robust addressing agility at CDN-scale (2 citations) 
  Papers citation over time  
 A key indicator for each conference is its effectiveness in reaching other researchers with the papers published at that venue.  
 The chart below presents the interquartile range (first quartile 25%, median 50% and third quartile 75%) of the number of citations of articles over time.

 Publication chance based on affiliation  
 The publication chance index shows the ratio of articles published by the best research institutions at the conference edition to all articles published within that conference. The best research institutions were selected based on the largest number of articles published during all editions of the conference.  
 The chart below presents the percentage ratio of articles from top institutions (based on their ranking of total papers).Top affiliations were grouped by their rank into the following tiers: top 1-10, top 11-20, top 21-50, and top 51+. Only articles with a recognized affiliation are considered.  

 Research.com  

 During the most recent 2021 edition, 3.12%  of publications had an unrecognized affiliation. Out of the publications with recognized affiliations, 28.23%  were posted by at least one author from the top 10 institutions publishing at the conference. Another 12.10%  included authors affiliated with research institutions from the top 11-20 affiliations. Institutions from the 21-50 range included 25.00%  of all publications and 34.68%  were from other institutions.  
 Returning Authors Index  
 A very common phenomenon observed among researchers publishing scientific articles is the intentional selection of conferences they have already attended in the past. In particular, it is worth analyzing the case when the authors participate in the same conference from year to year.  
 The Returning Authors Index presented below illustrates the ratio of authors who participated in both a given as well as the previous edition of the conference in relation to all participants in a given year.

 The experience to innovation index  
 Our experience to innovation index was created to show a cross-section of the experience level of authors publishing at a conference. The index includes the authors publishing at the last edition of a conference  , grouped by total number of publications throughout their academic career (P) and the total number of citations of these publications ever received (C).  
 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups:  
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25), 
  Competent - P < 10 or C < 100 (the number of publications less than 10 or the number of citations less than 100), 
  Experienced - P < 25 or C < 625 (the number of publications less than 25 or the number of citations less than 625), 
  Master - P < 50 or C < 2500 (the number of publications less than 50 or the number of citations less than 2500), 
  Star - P ≥ 50 and C ≥ 2500 (both the number of publications greater than 50 and the number of citations greater than 2500). 

 The chart below illustrates experience levels of first authors in cases of publications with multiple authors.
