 The EuroVis 2023 will be held in Leipzig, Germany in presence. This 25th edition of EuroVis will be hosted by the Leipzig University organized by the Image and Signal Processing Group – BSV in collaboration with the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research – UFZ. EuroVis is the annual Visualization Conference organized by the Eurographics Working Group on Data Visualization. It has been a Eurographics and IEEE co-supported international visualization symposium held in Europe annually since 1999, as a conference since 2012.  
 The exciting and vibrant field of Visualization is an increasingly important research area due to its wide range of applications in many disciplines. In general, our ability to collect, store, and archive data vastly exceed our ability to derive useful knowledge and insight. This is a ubiquitous problem. Data visualization is key to understanding large, complex data sets by exploiting the human visual system. Data visualization leverages computer graphics in order to provide a visual overview, explore, analyze, and present phenomena that are often difficult to understand.  
 The objective of the EuroVis conference is to create and strengthen connections between visualization researchers and practitioners, to foster collaborations, and to draw more researchers in Europe to enter this rapidly growing area of research. EuroVis has an expanded scope to include all areas of visualization and steadily more widespread visibility that allows achieving a more widespread impact.  
 The main conference is preceded by co-located events held in the same location on June 12th.

 About Leipzig

 The city is one of the most uprising cities in Germany with a rich history and culture. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Friedrich Nietzsche, and ex-chancellor Angela Merkel are all alumni of Leipzig University. Leipzig is surrounded by many beautiful lakes and nature and is close to the capital Berlin. Public transportation is included within the ticket  (valid from Sunday to Friday), so here are some impressions about our city. We are looking forward to seeing you there!
