 Welcome to DS-RT 2023 !  
  
 The 2023 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications (DS-RT 2023) promises to be a grand affair and will take place in Singapore. DS-RT 2023 serves as a platform for simulationists from academia, industry and research labs to present recent research results in Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications.  
   
  DS-RT 2023 targets the growing overlap between large distributed simulations and real time applications, such as metaverse, collaborative virtual environments, pervasive and ubiquitous application scenarios, actuator systems and the usage of artificial intelligence techniques in both simulation and real-time applications.  
   
  The conference features prominent invited speakers as well as papers by top researchers in the field. DS-RT 2023 will include contributed technical papers, invited papers, and tutorials. The proceedings will be published by IEEE-CS press.
