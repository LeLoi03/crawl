 Welcome  
  
 RTAS is a top-tier conference with a focus on systems research related to embedded systems  and time-sensitive systems  . The broad scope of RTAS ranges from traditional hard real-time systems to embedded systems without explicit timing requirements, including latency-sensitive systems with informal or soft real-time requirements. RTAS’23 has two main tracks:  
 Track 1: Systems and Applications; 
  Track 2: Applied Methodologies and Foundations. 
  RTAS’23 will be part of the CPS-IoT Week in San Antonio, Texas, from May 9-12, 2023.
