  Description   
   
 Description   
 The IEEE European Test Symposium (ETS) is Europe’s premier forum dedicated to presenting and discussing scientific results, emerging ideas, applications, hot topics, and new trends in the area of electronic-based circuits and system testing, reliability, security, and validation. ETS’22 will be held in Casa Convalescència, located in the historical modernist site Hospital de la Santa Creu I Sant Pau (World Heritage Site by UNESCO, 1997) in Barcelona, which is located 10 minutes walk from the Sagrada Familia. The format of the conference will be hybrid, please check the "COVID-19" menu for more details. ETS’22 is organized by UPC (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya).  
  The program includes keynotes, scientific paper presentations, panels, tutorials, workshops, and highlights/demos from the industry. Besides regular technical papers, ETS’22 provides the opportunity of submitting scientific contributions for hot-topic papers and case-study papers (each with specific evaluation criteria). Submissions are also solicited for special sessions, tutorials, panels, and workshops, as well as for the Ph.D. Forum. Linked to the main ETS’22 symposium, the Test Spring School and Fringe Workshops will be organized.
