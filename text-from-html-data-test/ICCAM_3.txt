 Conference Format   
  
 All meetings of ICIAM 2023 will be held, in person, at Waseda University and the conference program will be arranged according to Japan Standard Time. Conference rooms are capable of handling hybrid-style meetings, and, under reasonable request, participants who require online access to conference meetings will be accommodated.  
  All such requests should be directed to the organizer of the corresponding Minisymposium. In the case of a Contributed Talk, the Program Committee will contact the author(s) after the talk has been accepted to ask about the format of the talk.  

 Congress Venue   
  
 Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan  
 Waseda University is the largest research university in Japan. It is also one of the oldest universities, founded in 1882 by Shigenobu Okuma, who later became Prime Minister of Japan. The Okuma Auditorium was built in 1927 after his death in commemoration of his achievements. This auditorium is the symbol of Waseda University now. We plan to use 14 university buildings for ICIAM 2023. The buildings of Waseda University’s main campus are located close together, providing easy access from one building to another. A significant amount of signage and student volunteers will be used to assist the participants at the ICIAM venue.  
   
  The combination of these rooms and halls will enable us to hold at least 70 parallel sessions during the Congress, and all the facilities are designed to be barrier-free for guests with disabilities. Lunch is to be taken at restaurants around the congress venue, or at the cafeterias of Waseda Campus. Cafeterias will be able to cater to those with dietary restrictions and/or special needs.  
 Another attractive point of the venue is its convenient access from the metro system. The “Waseda” metro station is just a 5-minute walk from the Congress venue and the trains run every 5 minutes, from 5:00 am to midnight.  
 Accessibility is also good in Tokyo. Most of the metro and train stations are easily accessible for the disabled and most of them are equipped with either elevators or lifts. The “Waseda” metro station has both elevators and lifts. In addition, smart cards “Suica” and “Pasmo” can be used on almost all rail and bus lines in the Tokyo metropolitan area, and are accepted by a growing number of taxis. “Suica” IC cards are available for purchase at JR stations, while “Pasmo” cards are available at subway, private railway stations, and bus depots. You can also use these cards for shopping as electronic money at a constantly increasing number of registered shops.  
   
  The former president of Waseda University has kindly accepted our request for using, without a fee, any buildings with various modern conference equipment at the Waseda Campus. He hopes that this offer will assist the advancement of applied mathematics and industrial mathematics.  
 The Tokyo Metropolitan Government also has funds for supporting international congresses. The Faculty of Science and Engineering, Waseda University, where S. Oishi was the senior Dean, and the Tokyo Convention and Visitors Bureau of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government have signed a comprehensive partnership agreement. Based on this agreement, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has already decided to provide financial support worth approximately US$300,000 for ICIAM 2023 on the condition that it be held at Waseda University with a certain number of foreign participants. Furthermore, support of complimentary cultural programs for 120 persons and half-day city tours for 800 persons will be offered.

  An Introduction to Randomized Matrix Computations  
   Abstract:  
  We present a `user-friendly’ introduction to randomized matrix algorithms, with several case studies that focus on the ideas and intuition behind randomization.  
 The concerted development of randomized matrix algorithms started in the theoretical Computer Science community in the nineteen-nineties. At first a purely theoretical enterprise, these algorithms have become practical to the point that they are being used by domain scientists; and general purpose software libraries, such as RandBLAS and RandLAPACK, are under development.  
 Many randomized matrix algorithms reduce the problem dimension by replacing the original matrix with a lower-dimensional ‘sketch’. We illustrate this on the basic problem of matrix multiplication, and on the solution of least squares/regression problems. Along the way, we discuss sampling modalities (data-aware, oblivious), developments in high-dimensional probability (matrix concentration inequalities, matrix coherence), numerical issues (problem conditioning), and the analysis of the error due to randomization.  
 This talk draws on work with current and former students Jocelyn Chi, John Holodnak, Arnel Smith, and Thomas Wentworth.

  AI for Science   
  Abstract:  
  For many years, the lack of good algorithms has severely limited our ability to conduct scientific research. At its heart, the difficulty comes from the notorious “curse of dimensionality” problem. Deep learning is exactly the kind of tool needed to address this problem. In the last few years, we have seen a tremendous amount of scientific progress made as a result of the AI revolution, both in our ability to make use of the fundamental principles of physics, and our ability to make use of experimental data.  
 In this talk, I will start with the origin of the AI for Science revolution, review some of the major progresses made so far, and discuss how it will impact the way we do scientific research. I will also discuss how AI for Science might impact applied mathematics.

  Anomalous Dissipation in Fluid Dynamics  
   Abstract:  
  Kolmogorov’s K41 theory of turbulence advances quantitative predictions on anomalous dissipation in incompressible fluids. This phenomenon can be described as follows: although smooth solutions of the Euler equations conserve the kinetic energy, in turbulent fluids the energy can be transferred to high frequencies and anomalously dissipated. Hence turbulent solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations are expected to converge, in the vanishing viscosity limit, to irregular solutions of the Euler equations, with decreasing kinetic energy.  
 In rigorous analytical terms, however, this phenomenon is little understood. In this talk, I will present the recent developments on this topic and focus on a joint work with G. Crippa and M. Sorella which considers the case of passive-scalar advection, where anomalous dissipation is predicted by the Obukhov-Corrsin theory of scalar turbulence. I will discuss the construction of a velocity field and a passive scalar exhibiting anomalous dissipation in the supercritical Obukhov-Corrsin regularity regime. The techniques developed in this context allow also to answer the question of (lack of) selection for passive-scalar advection under vanishing diffusivity. Finally, I will present a joint work with E. Brue’, G. Crippa, C. De Lellis, and M. Sorella, where we use the previous construction to give example of anomalous dissipation for the forced Navier-Stokes equations in the supercritical Onsager regularity regime.

  Adaptive, Multilevel, Fourier-based Fast Transforms   
  Abstract:  
  The last few decades have seen the development of a variety of fast algorithms for computing convolutional transforms – that is, evaluating the fields induced by a collection of sources at a collection of targets, with an interaction specified by some radial function (such as the 1/r kernel of gravitation or electrostatics).  
 The earliest such scheme was Ewald summation, which relies on Fourier analysis for its performance and is best suited for uniform distributions of sources and targets. To overcome this limitation, approximation-theory based algorithms emerged, which organized the sources and targets on an adaptive tree data structure. By carefully separating source and target clusters at each length scale in the spatial hierarchy, linear scaling methods were developed to compute all pairwise interactions in linear time, more or less independent of the statistics of the distribution of points. (The fast multipole method is one such scheme.)  
 In this talk, we introduce a new class of methods for computing fast transforms that can be applied to a broad class of kernels, from the Green’s functions for constant coefficient partial differential equations to power functions and radial basis functions such as those used in statistics and machine learning. The DMK (dual-space multilevel kernel-splitting) framework combines features from fast multipole methods, Ewald summation, multilevel summation methods and asymptotic analysis to achieve speeds comparable to the FFT in work per gridpoint, even in a fully adaptive context.We will discuss both the algorithm and some of its applications to physical modeling in complex geometry. This is joint work with Shidong Jiang.

  The Pulse of Math   
  Abstract:  
  Computational medicine represents a formidable generator of mathematical problems and numerical methods that enable a deeper understanding of human physiology and provide crucial support to physicians for more accurate diagnoses, optimized therapies, and patient-specific surgical interventions.  
 The inherent difficulties associated with the multiphysics and multiscale nature of the problems at hand, data uncertainty, inter- and intra-patient variability, and the curse of dimensionality, can be overcome thanks to the development of accurate, physics-based models empowered with data-driven artificial intelligence algorithms.  
 In this presentation, we will show how the iHEART simulator, an integrated model of the human heart function, enables us to achieve these objectives for the first time, and discuss its future developments.

  Sequential Model Simplifications and Applications  
   Abstract:  
  We discuss the process of simplification or “complexification” of problems. We present a model algorithm that simplifies or complicate problems based on rational criteria. The algorithm is inspired in the scheme of inexact restoration of introduced originally for solving constrained optimization problems. We present the mathematical characteristics of the algorithm in terms of convergence and complexity. Examples will be given concerning the prediction of river flows.

  From Linear to Nonlinear Reduced Modeling : Theory and Algorithms   
  Abstract:  
  Reduced modeling techniques are of important use for tackling forward simulation and inverse problems, in the context of parametrized PDE’s. We shall first review concepts and algorithms that are relevant to linear reduced modeling : Kolmogorov width and reduced bases, proper orthogonal decompositions… We shall then discuss various strategies that aim at developing similar tools for nonlinear reduced modeling which appears to be beneficial in various applications.

  Persistent Homology from Viewpoints of Representation, Probability, and Application   
  Abstract:  
  Topological data analysis (TDA) is an emerging concept in applied mathematics, by which we can characterize shapes of massive and complex data using topological methods. In particular, the persistent homology and persistence diagrams are nowadays applied to a wide variety of scientific and engineering problems. In this talk, I will survey our recent research on persistent homology from three interrelated perspectives; quiver representation theory, random topology, and applications on materials science. First, on the subject of quiver representation theory, I will talk about our recent challenges to develop a theory of multiparameter persistent homology on commutative ladders. By applying interval decompositions/approximations on multiparameter persistent homology (Asashiba et al, 2022) to our setting, I will introduce a new concept called connected persistence diagrams, which properly possess information of multiparameter persistence, and show some properties of connected persistence diagrams. Next, about random topology, I will show our recent results on limit theorems (law of large numbers, central limit theorem, and large deviation principles) of persistent Betti numbers and persistence diagrams defined on several stochastic models such as random cubical sets and random point processes in a Euclidean space. Furthermore, I will also explain a preliminary work on how random topology can contribute to understand the decomposition of multiparameter persistent homology discussed in the first part. Finally, about applications, I will explain our recent activity on materials TDA project. By applying several new mathematical tools introduced above, we can explicitly characterize significant geometric and topological hierarchical features embedded in the materials (glass, granular systems, iron ore sinters etc), which are practically important for controlling materials functions.

  Stochastic Gradient Descent: Understanding Adaptive Step-sizes, Momentum, and Random Initialization   
  Abstract:  
  Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the foundational algorithm used in machine learning optimization, but several algorithmic modifications to the basic SGD algorithm are often needed to make it “work” on high-dimensional non-convex problems. Three of the crucial modifications are: adaptive step-size updates, momentum, and careful random initialization of the parameters. This talk will discuss recent theoretical insights towards understanding why adaptivity, momentum, and careful random initialization are so powerful in practice. In particular, the theory unveils a novel but simple initialization method for gradient descent on matrix- and tensor-factorization problems; with this initialization, we prove that gradient descent discovers optimal low-rank matrix and tensor factorizations in a small number of steps.

  Spectral Approaches to Complex Dynamics   
  Abstract:  
  The weather and the climate, along with social processes, biological processes, and engineering processes, are all dynamical systems because they are governed by a set of micro-rules at the level of individual states that describe how processes evolve over time. Complex dynamical systems incorporate elements of unpredictability (nearby initial states quickly diverge from one another) and emergence (macroscopic system behaviour is not apparent from the set of micro-rules due to many interacting components).  
 Emergent behaviour in complex dynamical systems is typically connected with the appearance of macro-structures that persist for a certain amount of time. Examples of such macro-structures include eddies in the ocean, cyclonic storms or heatwaves in the atmosphere, and the coalescing of societal opinion around a particular issue. It is these macro-phenomena that impact our daily world, but it remains challenging to identify key organising emergent phenomena from micro-rules or spatiotemporal observations. Part of the difficulty arises from the usually complicated nonlinear dynamics of the micro-rules. To access these macro-phenomena, we use a linear operator induced by the micro-dynamics. This linear operator – the transfer operator – acts on ensembles of individual states, and its linearity enables one to access a huge toolbox from linear analysis.  
 In this talk, we gently introduce the transfer operator and its associated spectral theory. We also make connections to a dynamic spectral geometry of evolving manifolds, centred on the dynamic Laplace operator. Several example analyses are presented, ranging across problems in climate, physical oceanography, and atmospheric science.

  Mathematical Approaches Towards Design and Discovery of Chemical Reactions   
  Abstract:  
  Recent developments in computational quantum chemistry enable us to explore the potential energy surface and extract chemical reaction networks. These methods are highly relevant to continuous optimization. To utilize this advancement for design and discover of chemical reactions, one naturally requires methods in discrete optimization and machine learning.  
 Given a configuration of atoms, one can determine the energy of the ground state via quantum chemistry calculation. This function, called the potential energy surface (PES), provides rich information on the structure of molecules. A local minimum of the PES corresponds to an equilibrium state, while a saddle point corresponds to a transition state. An elementary process of a chemical reaction can be understood as a move from one equilibrium state to another one via a transition state. Chemical reactions are often realized as a sequence of such moves, namely as a path in a network that consists of equilibrium states as vertices and transition states as edges. Such a network is called a chemical reaction network.  
 It is highly nontrivial, however, to extract the chemical reaction network unless the target system is very small. Ohno and Maeda (2004) developed a systematics method, called the ADDF (anharmonic downward distortion following) method, to explore the potential energy surface from one equilibrium state to a transition state. Subsequently, Maeda and Morokuma (2011) devised a different algorithm called the AFIR (artificial force inducing reaction) method based on the technique of incurring artificial force that pushes certain part of the system to a certain direction. The AFIR method is applicable to various situations including a reaction of type A + B → X.  
 These two methods have enabled us to extract chemical reaction networks. To utilize these methods for design and discovery of chemical reactions, however, there are still several issues to be resolved.  
 One example is how to select diverse molecules from unexplored areas of chemical space. We have so far developed a new approach for selecting a subset of diverse molecules from a given molecular list by combining two existing techniques in machine learning and discrete optimization: graph neural networks (GNNs) for learning vector representation of molecules and a diverse-selection framework by submodular function maximization.  
 Another issue is how to predict the yield of the target product from the chemical reaction network. This can be done by analyzing the kinetics of reactions that are modeled with large-scale highly stiff master equations, which is hard to solve numerically. A heuristic approach called the rate constant matrix contraction (RCMC) method has been developed. We will discuss theoretical property and efficient implementation of this method, which turns out to have a close relation to the greedy algorithm for submodular function maximization.

  The Mathematics of Reliable AI   
  Abstract:  
  The new wave of artificial intelligence is impacting industry, public life, and the sciences in an unprecedented manner. In industrial and applied mathematics, it has by now already led to paradigm changes in several areas. However, one current major drawback is the lack of reliability.  
 The goal of this lecture is to first provide an introduction into this new vibrant research area. We will then survey recent advances, in particular, concerning performance guarantees and explainability methods for artificial intelligence, which are key to ensure reliability. Finally, we will discuss fundamental limitations in terms of computability, which seriously affect diverse aspects of reliability, and reveal a surprising connection to novel computing approaches such as neuromorphic computing and quantum computing.

  A Consideration of Scientific – Technical Aspects and Artistic Aspect of Origami Engineering – Aiming to Create a New Big Industry and a New Fan Culture   
  Abstract:  
  Interests in current science and technology span both micro and macro extremes with remarkable progress in measurement technology. Because there are no manufacturing equipments for huge or microstructures, the structures themselves must double as manufacturing devices. Therefore, foldable and deployable origamble paper. It is inevitable that origami is born and nurtured in Japan. Thanks to Japi structures become more and more important. Washi is virtually the world’s first foldaan’s isolation during the Edo period and a peaceful and prosperous era, arts such as haiku, kabuki, and Noh peculiar to Japan were nurtured. Origami which is oe onf these arts has long been a precious art and was not considered to be a target for money. But British engineers developed a mass production method for honeycombs, inspired by Japanese Tanabata decorations which developed into a trillion yen industry. This fact inspired us to start origami engineering in 2003. Dr. Nojima brought in traditional Japanese paper cutting “Kirigami” and created the concept of curved honeycombs in 2002 which cannot be made using the existing British manufacturing method. Kirigami has also become an international language like origami and is now a significant field of origami engineering because kirigami honeycomb is more useful than origami structure for the above mentioned macro and micro structures. And now, let me show you a more advanced honeycomb. It has been challenging to build arbitrary shapes with a single connection. Still, through our research, we have successfully built an arbitrary shape structure with a single honeycomb and with a robot Moreover the cubic core developed by us from the origsmi-core because it is superior to the honeycomb core which has become a multi-trillion dollar industry owing to its maximum bending stiffness per weight. By the way, in addition to the above scientific and technical aspects, origami engineering has also an artistic aspect. I will touch on art of fan which is positioned as a bellows fold with bamboo bones inserted into the paper. Fan is a fusion of art and function which is the starting point of Japanese manufacturing and it was born in Japan over 1200 years ago. It is not well known that fan was elevated as a three-dimensional art unlike any other in the world thorough the hard work of great artists, such as Hokusai Katsushika and Sodatsu Tawaraya et al. in the Edo period because many fans have been reshaped as flat paintings, with the bones pulled out and edges cut off to remove time-related deterioration. Fan was originally aimed at storytelling because it can show the intersection of viewpoints and the direction in which the characters move using the crease. But it was difficult because the picture on the fan face appears different from the original flat painting, owing to the effects of folding and distortion depending on the fan shape. Here, the mathematical method is developed so that we can attempt to develop a new art that links Fan with Haiku and Waka by combining the mathematics and image processing technology.

  Randomized Algorithms for Tensor Decomposition   
  Abstract:  
  Tensors are ubiquitous in modern-day computational and data sciences. Tensor decomposition is a technique for breaking down a tensor into simpler components, akin to matrix factorization. Applications of tensor decomposition are ubiquitous in machine learning, signal processing, chemometrics, neuroscience, quantum computing, financial analysis, social science, business market analysis, image processing, and much more. Tensors are growing ever larger, motivating a need for robust and efficient computational methods that can handle massive tensor datasets. We discuss several examples of randomized algorithms for tensor decomposition. Tensor decomposition problems have special sructure that yields majors advantages in the application of randomization. We consider random methods such as randomized range finder for Tucker decomposition, matrix sketching using leverage scores for canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition, and biased sampling for stochastic gradient descent for generalized CP (GCP). We illustrate the effectiveness of randomized algorithms for tensor decomposition using real-world datasets.

  On Low-dimensional Structure in Transport and Inference   
  Abstract:  
  Transportation of measure underlies many powerful tools for Bayesian inference, density estimation, and generative modeling. The central idea is to deterministically couple a probability measure of interest with a tractable “reference” measure (e.g., a standard Gaussian). Such couplings are induced by transport maps, and enable direct simulation from the desired measure simply by evaluating the transport map at samples from the reference.  
 While an enormous variety of representations and constructive algorithms for transport maps have been proposed in recent years, it is inevitably advantageous to exploit the potential for low-dimensional structure in the associated probability measures. I will discuss two such notions of low-dimensional structure, and their interplay with transport-driven methods for sampling and inference. The first seeks to approximate a high-dimensional target measure as a low-dimensional update of a dominating reference measure. The second is low-rank conditional structure, where the goal is to replace conditioning variables with low-dimensional projections or summaries. In both cases, under appropriate assumptions on the reference or target measures, one can derive gradient-based upper bounds on the associated approximation error and minimize these bounds to identify good subspaces for approximation. The associated subspaces then dictate specific structural ansatzes for transport maps that represent the target of interest.  
 I will showcase several algorithmic instantiations of this idea, focusing on Bayesian inverse problems, data assimilation, and simulation-based inference.

  Algebraic Geometry and Systems Biology   
  Abstract:  
  In recent years, methods and concepts from algebraic geometry, particularly those from computational and real algebraic geometry, have been used in many applied domains. I will review applications to molecular biology, which aim to analyze standard models in systems biology to predict dynamic behavior across parameter space without the need for simulations. These applications have also given rise to new challenges in the field of real algebraic geometry.

  Should we Derive or Let the Data Drive ? Symbiotizing Data-driven Learning and Knowledge-based Reasoning to Accelerate Symbolic Discovery  
   Abstract:  
  The abstraction of the behavior of a system or a phenomenon into a consistent mathematical model is instrumental for a variety of applications in science and engineering. In the context of scientific discovery, a fundamental problem is to explain natural phenomena in a manner consistent with both (noisy) experimental data, and a body of (possibly inexact and incomplete) background knowledge about the laws of the universe.  
 Historically, models were manually derived in a first-principles deductive fashion. The first-principles approach often offers the derivation of interpretable symbolic models of remarkable levels of universality while being substantiated by little data. Nonetheless, derivation of such models is time-consuming and relies heavily upon domain expertise.  
  Conversely, with the rising pervasiveness of statistical AI and data-driven approaches, automated, rapid construction and deployment of models has become a reality. Many data-driven modeling techniques demonstrate remarkable scalability due to their reliance upon predetermined, exploitable model form (functional form) structures. Such structures, entail non-interpretable models, demand Big Data for training, and provide limited predictive power for out-of-set instances.  
 In this talk, we will review some of the recent transformations in the field, and the ongoing attempts to bridge the divide between statistical AI and symbolic AI. We will begin by discussing algorithms that can search for free-form symbolic models, where neither the structure nor the set of operator primitives is predetermined. We will proceed in reviewing innovations in the field of automated theorem proving (ATP) machinery, and discuss how ATPs can be harnessed to certify whether a candidate hypothesis model is conforming with background theory. Lastly, we shall discuss efforts to consistently unify the two approaches.  
 These endeavors will promote the conceptualization of AI algorithms capable of making the discovery of principled, universal, and meaningful symbolic models, using small data and incomplete background theory. With some optimism, some of these discoveries, can unveil to us the secrets of the universe.

  Characterizing Rare Events in Interacting Particle Systems   
  Abstract:  
  Interacting particle systems consist of collections of stochastically evolving particles indexed by the vertices of a graph, where each particle’s state depends directly only on the states of neighboring vertices in the graph. Such systems model a wide range of physical phenomena including magnetism, the spread of diseases and information, neuronal spiking and opinion dynamics. Of crucial interest in these systems is the study of rare events, or large deviations from typical behavior. While classical work has focused on the case when the underlying graph is dense, where mean-field theory is applicable, most real-world networks are sparse. We survey what is rigorously known about large deviations behavior in such systems, with a focus on recent progress in the setting of (uniformly) sparse graphs.

  Measuring Our Chances: Risk Prediction in This World and its Betters   
  Abstract:  
  Prediction algorithms score individuals, assigning a number between zero and one that is often interpreted as an individual probability: a 0.7 “chance” that this child is in danger in the home; an 80% “probability” that this woman will succeed if hired; a 1/3 “likelihood” that they will graduate within 4 years of admission. But what do words like “chance,” “probability,” and “likelihood” actually mean for a non-repeatable activity like going to college? This is a deep and unresolved problem in the philosophy of probability. Without a compelling mathematical definition we cannot specify what an (imagined) perfect risk prediction algorithm should produce, nor even how an existing algorithm should be evaluated. Undaunted, AI and machine learned algorithms churn these numbers out in droves, sometimes with life-altering consequences.  
 An explosion of recent research deploys insights from the theory of pseudo-randomness – objects that “look random” but in fact have structure – to yield a tantalizing answer to the evaluation problem, together with a supporting algorithmic framework with roots in the theory of algorithmic fairness.  
 We can aim even higher. Both (1) our qualifications, health, and skills, which form the inputs to a prediction algorithm, and (2) our chances of future success, which are the desired outputs from the ideal risk prediction algorithm, are products of our interactions with the real world. But the real world is systematically inequitable. How, and when, can we hope to approximate probabilities not in this world, but in a better world, one for which, unfortunately, we have no data at all? Surprisingly, this novel question is inextricably bound with the very existence of nondeterminism.

  The Ensemble Kalman Filter   
  Abstract:  
  Ensemble Kalman filters constitute a methodology for incorporating noisy data into complex dynamical models to enhance predictive capability. They are widely adopted in the geophysical sciences, underpinning weather forecasting for example, and are starting to be used throughout the sciences and engineering; furthermore, they have been adapted to function as a general-purpose tool for parametric inference. The strength of these methods stems from their ability to operate using complex models as a black box, together with their natural adaptation to high performance computers. This talk describes recent theoretical advances which elucidate, for the first time, conditions under which this widely adopted methodology provides accurate model predictions and uncertainties.  
 The analysis is developed for the mean field limit of the ensemble Kalman filter. The filter is rewritten in terms of maps on probability measures. These maps are shown to be locally Lipschitz in an appropriate weighted total variation metric. Using these stability estimates it may be shown that, if the true filtering distribution is close to Gaussian after appropriate lifting to the joint space of state and data, then it is well approximated by the ensemble Kalman filter.

  The Mathematics of Image Reconstruction: the Dialectic of Modelling and Learning   
  Abstract:  
  In this talk we will discuss some current and future challenges in high-dimensional image reconstruction, which is based on the solution of large-scale inverse problems involving various uncertainties. While classical methods were purely based on physical models for forward operators and regularizations, modern machine learning techniques create the antithesis of data-driven approaches. We will discuss some pitfalls that machine learning can encounter in inverse problems and discuss opportunities for the synthesis of model- and data-driven approaches.

  Old-fashioned Machine Learning: Using Diffusion Methods to Learn Underlying Structure   
  Abstract:  
  Many datasets consist of complex items that can be reasonably surmised to lie on a manifold of much lower dimension than the number of parameters or coordinates with which the individual items are acquired. Manifold diffusion is an established method, used successfully to parametrize such datasets much more succinctly. The talk describes an enhancement of this method: when each individual item is itself a complex object, as is the case in many applications, one can model the collection as a fiber bundle, and build a fiber bundle diffusion operator from which one can gradually learn properties of the underlying base manifold. This will be illustrated with applications to morphological evolutionary studies in biology.

  Lattice-based Cryptography: From Theory to Practice   
  Abstract:  
  Although most of current public key cryptosystems are vulnerable to attacks of the imaginary quantum computers. the post-quantum cryptography（PQC）which resists on the quantum computing has made the surprising progress in the past 30 years. Among of the post-quantum cryptographic families, the lattice-based cryptography is popularly regarded as an economic and secure solution, its security relies on the hardness of computational mathematical problems in lattice theory with high-dimension. In this talk, I will recap the mathematical background of lattice-based cryptography. Then I will introduce the recent progress on the practical designs of lattice-based cryptosystems, and also have a fast look at an amazing area which is called fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) which has interesting applications of the privacy computing and federal learning etc.

  Sums of Squares: from Algebra to Analysis   
  Abstract:  
  The representation of non-negative functions as sums of squares has become an important tool in many modeling and optimization tasks. Traditionally applied to polynomial functions, it requires rich tools from algebraic geometry that led to many developments in the last twenty years. In this lecture, I will look at this problem from a functional analysis point of view, leading to new applications and new results on the performance of sum-of-squares optimization.

  Performance Analysis of Sums of Squares Approximations in Polynomial Optimization   
  Abstract:  
  Polynomial optimization is a recent field, which emerged in the last two decades, starting with pioneering works, in particular, by J.-B. Lasserre and P. Parrilo. It deals with optimization problems involving polynomial objective and constraints. These are computationally hard problems, in general nonlinear and nonconvex, ubiquitous in diverse fields and application areas such as discrete optimization, operations research, discrete geometry, theoretical computer science, and control theory.  
  The key idea is to exploit algebraic and geometric properties of polynomials and develop dedicated solution methods that are based, on the one hand, on real algebraic results about positive polynomials, and, on the other hand, on functional analytic results about moments of positive measures. These techniques permit to design hierarchies of convex relaxations – known as sums of squares hierarchies – that give bounds on the global optimum of the original problem. The underlying computational paradigm is semidefinite optimization, which permits to model sums of squares of polynomials (used as a proxy to certify polynomial positivity).  
 A crucial feature is that, under some mild compactness assumption, these hierarchies converge asymptotically to the global optimum. A natural question is to understand how the quality of the bounds depends on the level of the relaxation, which is governed by the maximum degree of the sums of squares it involves.  
 In this lecture we will discuss these hierarchies, with a special focus on the above question regarding their quantitative analysis. We will present recent state-of-the-art results for polynomial optimization over various classes of semi-algebraic sets and the main techniques used to obtain these results, which include Fourier analysis, reproducing kernels, and extremal roots of orthogonal polynomials.

  Kinetic Models of Dilute Polymeric Fluids: Analysis and Approximation   
  Abstract:  
  Since the pioneering contributions of Werner Kuhn, Hans Kramers and other scientists working at the interface of polymer chemistry and statistical physics during the first half of the twentieth century, kinetic models have been widely and successfully used to describe the motion of polymeric fluids.  
 The aim of this talk is to review recent results concerning the mathematical analysis of these models. We focus in particular on questions of existence of large-data global weak solutions to kinetic models of dilute polymeric fluids — a system of nonlinear partial differential equations involving the compressible or incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, modelling the evolution of the velocity field and the pressure, coupled to a Fokker–Planck equation satisfied by the probability density function for the random configuration vectors associated with the directions of the backbones of noninteracting polymer molecules suspended in a Newtonian fluid. We shall also discuss the convergence analysis of finite element methods for the numerical solution of this coupled system of partial differential equations and will highlight some nontrivial open problems.

  Recovery of a Metric Tensor from the Partial Hyperbolic Dirichlet to Neumann Map   
  Abstract:  
  In this talk we consider the inverse problem of determining on a compact Riemannian manifold the metric tensor in the wave equation with Dirichlet data from measured Neumann sub-boundary observations. This information is enclosed in the dynamical partial Dirichlet-to-Neumann map associated to the wave equation. We prove in dimension n  ≥ 2 that the knowledge of the partial Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for the wave equation uniquely determines the metric tensor and we establish logarithm-type stability.

  Recent Progress in the Variational Approach to Fracture   
  Abstract:  
  The talk will introduce the variational approach to fracture, proposed by Francfort and Marigo in the late nineties as a natural extension to Griffith’s classical theory, with the ability to predict crack paths in brittle materials (with some numerical success). This theory is based on the global minimization of a linearized elasticity energy and a dissipation term proportional to the surface of a new crack. A continuous limit of successive minimizations is expected to result in an evolving crack which generalizes in a natural way the classical theory from the 1920s. However, this approach raises huge difficulties, such as, simply, how to define an energy space for such a variational problem, or the existence of minimizers. The talk will focus on some of the main mathematical tools developed to tackle this problem in the past ten years, and will describe a few recent results (and some open questions). Based on joint works with Filippo Cagnetti, Sergio Conti, Vito Crismale, Gilles Francfort, Flaviana Iurlano, Lucia Scardia, and the development of many others.

  The Fusion of Machine Learning and Optimization   
  Abstract:  
  The fusion of machine learning and optimization has the potential to achieve breakthroughs in decision making that the two technologies cannot accomplish independently. This talk reviews a number of research avenues in this direction, including the concept of optimization proxies and end-to-end learning. Principled combinations of machine learning and optimization are illustrated on case studies in energy systems, mobility, and supply chains. Preliminary results show how this fusion makes it possible to perform real-time risk assessment in energy systems, find near-optimal solutions quickly in supply chains, and implement model-predictive control for large-scale mobility systems.

  Aggregation-Diffusion Equations for Collective Behaviour in the Sciences   
  Abstract:  
  Many phenomena in the life sciences, ranging from the microscopic to macroscopic level, exhibit surprisingly similar structures. Behaviour at the microscopic level, including ion channel transport, chemotaxis, and angiogenesis, and behaviour at the macroscopic level, including herding of animal populations, motion of human crowds, and bacteria orientation, are both largely driven by long-range attractive forces, due to electrical, chemical or social interactions, and short-range repulsion, due to dissipation or finite size effects.  
 Various modelling approaches at the agent-based level, from cellular automata to Brownian particles, have been used to describe these phenomena. An alternative way to pass from microscopic models to continuum descriptions requires the analysis of the mean-field limit, as the number of agents becomes large. All these approaches lead to a continuum kinematic equation for the evolution of the density of individuals known as the aggregation-diffusion equation. This equation models the evolution of the density of individuals of a population, that move driven by the balances of forces: on one hand, the diffusive term models diffusion of the population, where individuals escape high concentration of individuals, and on the other hand, the aggregation forces due to the drifts modelling attraction/repulsion at a distance.  
 The aggregation-diffusion equation can also be understood as the steepest-descent curve (gradient flow) of free energies coming from statistical physics. Significant effort has been devoted to the subtle mechanism of balance between aggregation and diffusion. In some extreme cases, the minimisation of the free energy leads to partial concentration of the mass.  
 Aggregation-diffusion equations are present in a wealth of applications across science and engineering. Of particular relevance is mathematical biology, with an emphasis on cell population models. The aggregation terms, either in scalar or in system form, is often used to model the motion of cells as they concentrate or separate from a target or interact through chemical cues. The diffusion effects described above are consistent with population pressure effects, whereby groups of cells naturally spread away from areas of high concentration.  
 This talk will give an overview of the state of the art in the understanding of aggregation-diffusion equations, and their applications in mathematical biology.

  On Some Overdetermined Boundary Value Problems   
  Abstract:  
  Second order elliptic equations on a domain in which both Dirichlet and  
  Neumann conditions are prescribed at the boundary of the domains constitute a class of overdetermined problems. To deal with these problems, we are led to find two unknowns: solution and the domain. They appear in many physical questions such as fluid and solid mechanics. In addition, they appear when minimizing domain-dependent energy functionals such as Sobolev norms and eigenvalues. While a lot of progress is being made, there still remains challenging open problems, e.g. the Schiffer conjecture: which states that if a nontrivial eigenfunction of the Neumann eigenvalue problem, on a bounded domain, has a constant Dirichlet boundary condition then the domain must be a ball.  
 In this talk, we provide an overview on recent results on overdetermined  
  and discuss new results on the Schiffer problem on some manifolds.

  Learning and Feedback in the Control of Uncertain Dynamical Systems  
   Abstract:  
  Learning and feedback are complementary mechanisms in dealing with uncertain dynamical systems. Learning plays a basic role in the design of control systems, and feedback makes it possible for a control system to perform well in an open environment with various uncertainties. In this lecture, some basic results will be presented when online learning is combined with feedback in the control of uncertain dynamical systems. We will first consider the celebrated self-tuning regulators (STR) in adaptive control of uncertain linear stochastic systems, where the STR is designed by combining the recursive least-squares estimator with the minimum variance controller. The global convergence of this natural and seemingly simple adaptive system had actually been a longstanding open problem in control theory. Next, we will discuss the rationale and foundation behind the widespread successful industrial applications of the well-known proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control for nonlinear uncertain systems and provide a new and powerful online learning-based design method. Finally, we will present some basic results on more fundamental problems concerning the maximum capability and limitations of the feedback mechanism in dealing with uncertain nonlinear systems, where the feedback mechanism is defined as the class of all possible feedback laws. The results presented in this lecture may offer useful implications for the design and analysis of more complicated control systems where AI is combined with online feedback control.

  What the @#$! is Cohomology Doing in Numerical Analysis?!   
  Abstract:  
  As the name suggests, numerical analysis — the study of computational algorithms to solve mathematical problems, such as differential equations — has traditionally been viewed mostly as a branch of analysis. Geometry, topology, and algebra played little role. Indeed, often departments created special degree requirements so that computational and applied math students could avoid studying these subjects altogether. However in the last decade or things have changed. The recent numerical analysis literature is replete with papers using concepts that are new to the subject, say, symplectic differential forms or de Rham cohomology or Hodge theory. In this talk we will discuss some examples of this phenomenon, especially the Finite Element Exterior Calculus. We shall see why these new ideas arise naturally in numerical analysis and how they contribute.

  Iterative Linear Algebra for Large Scale Computations   
  Abstract:  
  The field of what may be termed “iterative linear algebra” blends a fascinating combination of mathematical analysis tools, clever algorithm development, approximation techniques, as well as effective implementations. For example, approximation theory plays a major role in developing and analyzing iterative algorithms, as do advanced linear algebra, error analysis, and high-performance computing. In addition, research in this area is deemed to be most successful if it winds up helping to solve challenging problems in real-life applications, whether in fluid mechanics (large sparse linear systems), or in electronic structure calculations (large eigenvalue problems).  
 This talk will provide a perspective on iterative linear algebra with emphasis on Krylov subspace methods. Part of the presentation will also examine more recent trends and emerging demands in an effort to anticipate promising new directions for iterative linear algebra.

  Simulation of PDEs on Geometries Obtained via Boolean Operations   
  Abstract:  
  Geometric design uses splines representation of surfaces as the main building bloc, but it involves many other ingredients. Geometries are described as a combination of primitives and spline/NURBS boundary representations which are combined via boolean operations, such as intersections and unions. We aim to develop numerical methods that are robustly able to tackle the simulation of PDEs over such “unstructured” geometric representation. For example, dealing with trimming, which corresponds to an intersection operation in geometric modelling, falls into the category of immersed/unfitted discretizations (e.g., Finite Cell Method, cutFEM, immerse-geometric analysis, shifted boundary method, aggregated unfitted FEM), where computational meshes do not align with geometric boundaries/interfaces.  
 While geometric modelling is extremely flexible, various issues have to be addressed on the analysis side, such as stability, quadrature, imposition of boundary conditions, conditioning of the underlying linear system, etc.  
 In this talk, we discuss various aspects of this interesting challenge. Starting from defeaturing, which means a systematic removal of features from a geometric model, and its implication on accuracy, to stability issues in the presence of slim or small cut elements, to efficient quadrature, to the imposition of the boundary condition and to the extension of the framework to the assembly of several geometries via union.  
 Finally, we discuss also how to make these approaches viable in a shape optimization loop, by discussing their use within a reduced-order modelling framework.  
 I will conclude the talk by showing results and discussing challenges.

 Title  
 Impossible World Represented by Real 3D Objects  
 Abstract  
 Escher presented the impossible world by 2D pictures, while we present it using real 3D objects. A mathematical model of the human vision and optical illusion enables us to create 3D objects whose behaviors look impossible. The illusion is strong so that we can enjoy even when we see them by two eyes.  
 Early 3D realizations of impossible figures are valid only when we see them from the specific viewpoint with a single eye, and hence they were almost equivalent to 2D pictures. Our impossible objects, on the other hand, are true 3D realizations in the sense that the viewpoint is not strictly restricted.  
 Profile  
 Kokichi Sugihara is a Meiji University distinguished professor emeritus. His research area is mathematical engineering. In his research on computer vision, he found a method for constructing 3D objects from “impossible figures”, and extended his research interest to human vision and optical illusion. He is acting also as an illusion artist by creating various impossible objects. He won the first prize four times in the Best Illusion of the Year Contest.

 Safety and Feel Safety Induced by Applied Mathematics in Automotive Industry Toward Autonomous Automation  
 Abstract  
 Founders of TOYOTA dreamed “Flying Nimbus” that is a magical flying cloud in Chinese classic literature “Journey to the West, Saiyuki.” When I was told about this look-like very childish dream by Dr. Shoichiro Toyoda at the visit to Toyota Central R&D Laboratories while I was working in University of Michigan, I was so impressed by the dream that he storied through Flying Nimbus. It is a sustainable safe and feel safe vehicle made from water and air! Dr. Toyoda asked me to lead advanced research for Flying Nimbus with extremely charming smile. Researchers must be realistic, but they are so dreamy, too.  
 In this talk, various struggling stories would be presented with so many failing so few successful trials to implement this notion in real vehicles applying all possible science and technology, especially computer related applied mathematics. Through this dreamy venture, we have leaned enormous difference between safety and feel safety together with clear distinction between personal and social acceptance. Applied mathematics, especially computer related science and technology including artificial intelligence, would be a key potential remedy to close the gaps mentioned.

 Understanding the Dimensions of Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (JEDI) across the globe in Applied Mathematics Research and Education  
 Abstract  
 In this talk, the participants will engage in learning about integrating equitable practices for advancing their understanding of racial equity in applied mathematical research, education and outreach. Discussions will include the impact of unconscious bias which is influenced by cultural stereotypes that affect how individuals evaluate and treat one another. These often continue to impact both universities and workplace environments across the globe. Another important discussion will include the different perspectives of justice, equity, diversity and inclusion (JEDI) in the applied mathematics community which are often exhibited by power inclusive behaviors in different cultures. We will also discuss effective use of applied mathematics tools and techniques to address systemic inequality and to reduce variations in judgment across humans that require more than just the adoption of the right technical approaches to the right data sets about people, institutions, communities, and systems. Finally, we hope that the session will help to empower participants with the latest scientific findings on the learning characteristics of underrepresented populations, understand the different approaches to JEDI across the globe, gain awareness of cultural differences and employ an inclusive, equitable and culturally relevant pedagogy in applied mathematics education and research.  
  Dr. Seshaiyer is the Chair of the SIAM Diversity Advisory Committee that consists of distinguished members from the Applied Mathematics community across the globe who assist SIAM in addressing policy issues that arise in relationship to underrepresented groups.

 Title  
 The Possibilities of Origami: Art, Mathematics, and Applications in Engineering  
 Abstract  
 Origami is a traditional art form of Japan with a rich history. Simple and beautiful creations such as the origami crane and paper boat are iconic symbols of this art. However, origami is not only admired for its beauty but also for its complexity and mathematical aspects. Furthermore, the folding characteristic of origami proves to be a functional feature in engineering, making it promising for industrial applications. In this lecture, the historical background of origami will be explored, and the speaker will explain how it is intricately connected with mathematics and how it’s being applied in various industries. Additionally, we will discuss the evolution of origami design through the utilization of computers. The speaker will introduce the techniques they have developed for creating shapes with curved surfaces and at the end of the lecture, participants will have the opportunity to experience folding origami using curves.

 The 2023 ICIAM prizes will be awarded at the Opening Ceremony of the International Congress for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, ICIAM 2023, to be held in Tokyo (Japan), on August 20-25, 2023. The Prize Committee was chaired by Ya-xiang Yuan, the President of ICIAM. Other members were:  
 Gang Bao (Chair of Maxwell Prize Subcommittee). 
  Alfredo Bermudez (Chair of Pioneer Prize Subcommittee). 
  Nira Chamberlian (Chair of Industry Prize Subcommittee). 
  Leah Edelstein-Keshet (Chair of Lagrange Prize Subcommittee). 
  Lois Curfman McInnes (Chair of Su Buchin Prize Subcommittee). 
  Kim-Chuan Toh (Chair of Collatz Prize Subcommittee). 
  ICIAM Collatz Prize  
  
 The 2023 ICIAM Collatz Prize is awarded to Maria Colombo (EPFL Lausanne, Switzerland) for her fundamental contributions to the regularity theory and the analysis of singularities in elliptic PDEs, geometric variational problems, transport equations, and incompressible fluid dynamics.  
 The Collatz Prize was established to provide international recognition to individual scientists under 42 years of age for outstanding work on industrial and applied mathematics. It was created on the initiative of GAMM   , and first awarded in 1999. Carrying a cash award of USD 5000, the Collatz Prize is presently funded by GAMM   .  

 Maria Colombo was born in 1989 in Luino, Italy. She received her Bachelor and Master degrees in Mathematics from University of Pisa, and PhD degree from Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa in 2015. After holding positions at the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, she joined EPFL Lausanne as an Assistant Professor in 2018, where she is now a Full Professor of Mathematics. Maria Colombo has received several prizes and awards that include the 2022 Peter Lax award, the 2019 Bartolozzi Prize from the Italian Mathematical Union, and the 2015 Michele Cuozzo Prize for her PhD thesis.  
  
 Maria Colombo has made substantial contributions to the regularity theory and the analysis of singularities in elliptic PDEs, transport equations, and incompressible ﬂuid dynamics. In particular, she has made significant advances in the understanding of the long-time behavior of solutions to fundamental equations in ﬂuids such as Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. In her joint work with Buckmaster and Vicol, they showed the existence of badly behaved weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations which are smooth except for a singular set of times of Hausdorff dimension less than 1. Very recently, her joint work with Albritton and Brue’ constructed for the first time nonunique Leray-Hopf solutions of the forced Navier-Stokes equations. Together with her student Haffter, they also proved that the singular set of Leray-Hopf weak solutions of the supercritical SQG (surface quasi-geostrophic) equation is contained in a compact set in spacetime whose Hausdorff dimension is also estimated. Maria Colombo has several works (with Spolaor, Edelen and Velichkov) on the structure of singularities for solutions to the obstacle problem and minimal surfaces. Their work on the log-epiperimetric inequality in GAFA is a beautiful discovery that has sparked subsequent major developments in the area.

  ICIAM Pioneer Prize  
  
 Awarded to Leslie Greengard (Courant Institute, New York University and Flatiron Institute, Simons Foundation) for his pioneering work on fast algorithms including the fast multipole method (one of the top-ten algorithms of the 20th century), fast Gauss transform, and fast direct solvers; and for the development of innovative high-order, automatically adaptive algorithms for differential and integral equations.  

 Leslie Greengard was born in London, England, but grew up in the United States in New York City, Boston, and New Haven. He holds a B.A. in mathematics from Wesleyan University (1979), an M.D, from the Yale University School of Medicine (1987), and a Ph.D. in computer science from Yale University (1987).  
 From 2006-2011, Greengard was director of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, an independent division of the New York University (NYU) and is currently a professor of mathematics and computer science at this prestigious Center. He is also director of the Center for Computational Mathematics at the Flatiron Institute, a division of the Simons Foundation. He formerly served as the director at the Center for Computational Biology in the Flatiron Institute.  
 Professor Greengard has had a profound impact on computational mathematics. The Fast Multipole Method (FMM), developed together with Vladimir Rokhlin, is one of the top ten algorithms of the 20th century. Its impact has been further enhanced by complementary techniques such as  
 Fast Gauss transforms for the rapid computation of Gauss convolution over unstructured point sets; 
  Fast algorithms and implementations for three types of non-uniform Fourier transforms; 
  Fast direct solvers for non-oscillatory and oscillatory integral equations based on the idea of recursive skeletonization. 
  These contributions have enabled simulations that would otherwise be completely intractable in áreas such as electromagnetics, acoustics, computational biology, fluid and solid mechanics, heat transfer, quantum mechanics, and biomedical imaging.  
 Besides its immediate impact for solving fast summation problems that arise directly in computational simulations, the other dramatic impact of the FMM was that it unlocked integral equation formulations as a tool for mathematical modeling of large scale problems. Leslie has spearheaded a decades long effort to extend integral equations techniques to apply to not only elliptic problems, but also parabolic ones like the heat equation, or the Navier-Stokes equations.  
 Professor Greengard is a prolific writer with more than 120 professional articles. Many of these articles are highly cited and some of his review articles have strongly influenced the field of applied and computational mathematics.  
 He was an invited speaker for the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in 1998 and an invited speaker for the International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM) in 1999. He gave the prestigious von Neumann Lecture of SIAM in 2014. He has been elected to National Academy of Sciences (USA), National Academy of Engineering (USA), and American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

 Prof. Albert Cohen  
    
 Albert Cohen is a professor at Sorbonne Université, Paris, France, since 1995.  
 His early research works (from his PhD of 1990, supervised by Yves Meyer, until 1998) were concerned with the development of the theory of wavelet bases in relation with algorithms used in signal and image processing, or in computer aided geometric design. One significant achievement was the derivation, together with Ingrid Daubechies and Jean-Christophe Feauveau, of biorthogonal wavelet bases which are used in the state of the art image compression standard JPEG 2000.  
 Since 1998, his research oriented towards various applicative directions, with as a common denominator its theoretical foundations in nonlinear approximation theory and harmonic analysis. In particular, it has led to the development and analysis of adaptive and sparsity-based numerical methods in various application contexts such as (i) data compression, (ii) statistical estimation and learning theory or (iii) discretizations of partial differential equations.  
 Albert Cohen is often joining forces with his colleagues Wolfgang Dahmen and Ronald DeVore. Some of their most significant results are concerned with the analysis of adaptive methods for PDE’s, the space BV, greedy algorithms, and statistical learning theory. A topic of particular interest the present time is high-dimensional approximation problems arising in learning theory and in the numerical treatment of parametric and stochastic PDE’s.  
 His current research is in particular concerned with problems that involve a very large number of variables, and whose efficient numerical treatment is therefore challenged by the so-called curse of dimensionality, meaning that computational complexity increases exponentially in the variable dimension. Such problems are ubiquitous in an increasing number of applicative areas, among which statistical or active learning theory, parametric and stochastic partial differential equations, parameter optimization in numerical codes, with a high demand from the industrial world of efficient numerical methods.  
 Central scientific objectives in this context are (i) to identify fundamental mathematical principles behind overcoming the curse of dimensionality, (ii) to understand how these principles enter in relevant instances of the applications described above, and, (iii) based on these principles to develop broadly applicable concrete adaptive numerical strategies that benefit from such mechanisms.  
 Albert Cohen’s research has been supported by the Advanced ERC grant BREAD (Breaking the Curse of Dimensionality in Analysis and Simulation) awarded in 2014. He has been a junior and senior member of the Institut Universitaire de France, and he is a member of the European Academy of Sciences.

 Prof. Xiaoyun Wang  
   Xiaoyun Wang is a mathematician and cryptographer. She is a C. N. Yang Professor in Institute for Advanced Study, Tsinghua University, the Academician of Chinese Academy of Sciences and the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) fellow. Xiaoyun Wang is well-known for her research on hash functions. Hash functions are the key technique of many cryptographic applications such as digital signatures, integrity verifications, password validations and blockchains. A hash function generates a short digest (digital fingerprint) of the input message. Collision-resistance is one of three security properties of cryptographic hash functions (the others are preimage resistance and second-preimage resistance). Xiaoyun Wang developed the bit-based cryptanalysis theory, and gave the collision attack on five dedicated hash functions including widely deployed MD5 and SHA-1. In response to SHA-1 attack, the US National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) recommended the replacement of SHA-1 by SHA-2 hash function family and announced a 5-year project to design the new hash function standard SHA-3. She was in charge of designing SM3 cryptographic hash function, as the Chinese standard, which has been deployed widely in financial, transportation, state grid and other important economic fields in China. In October 2018, SM3 officially became one of the ISO/IEC standards of new generation hash functions. She also analysed some cryptographic primitives with keys, including message authentication codes, symmetric ciphers and authenticated encryption schemes, and achieved very important results on HMAC-MD5, MD5-MAC, SIMON, Keccak-MAC, etc. Since 2006, she has been focusing on post-quantum public-key cryptography, and gave innovative results in lattice-based cryptography, including a two-level heuristic sieve algorithm for general lattices and the design of practical lattice-based algorithms with tight security.

 His title for the invited lecture in ICIAM 2023 is “Mathematical sciences for realization of origami engineering aided land / sea / air self-driving car with intelligence”. The lecture will consist of origami engineering, machine learning, optimal control and control of plural eigenfrequencies. In origami engineering, it will be shown the most splendid Japanese Kirigami honeycomb which receives very much attention because it is the best treasure trove to produce metamaterials. As far as machine learning, it will be shown his own technology FQHNN(Fuzzy Quantification method aided Holographic Neural Network) which has causal information unlike CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) which leads the third generation of machine learning. And in optimal control, it will be shown also his own method which is only one real-time optimal control method. The so-called optimal control is not used in the real car because Pontryagin’s maximum principle gives the nonlinear equation which cannot be solved in real time. He has noticed the analogy of the new optimal control theory and the nature of the solution of parabolic equations for the first time and this has contributed to pass this problem. As far as control of plural eigenfrequencies, it is very difficult to be applied the conventional topology optimization. He has developed a new high speed and high accuracy topology change method for ride quality improvement and elimination of anxiety due to the absence of the driver in the self-driving car from observations of strain and dynamic energy distributions of each eigen frequency mode. He is mobilizing with his lab members all of these technologies to successfully create an origami engineering aided land / sea / air self-driving car with intelligence. Here he will discuss the mathematical backbones for these techniques which successfully develop the dream land / sea / air self-driving car with intelligence.

 The Olga Taussky-Todd Lecture   
  
 The Olga Taussky-Todd Lecture at ICIAM 2023  
 The International Council for Industrial and Applied Mathematics has selected Professor IIse C.F. Ipsen  of North Carolina State University, USA, to deliver the Olga Taussky-Todd Lecture at the International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics, ICIAM 2023, in Tokyo, Japan. This Congress is the most important international event in applied and industrial mathematics, held once every four years under the auspices of the International Council for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.  
 Ilse Ipsen is an applied mathematician whose pioneering work, from the outset, has been aimed at advancing the foundations and applications of numerical linear algebra. Her publications and presentations are distinguished by crystal clear exposition and exceptional attention to detail.  
   Ilse Ipsen’s early work was at the forefont of designing matrix algorithms for implementation on VLSI special purpose architectures as well as general purpose parallel machines. She has worked on inverse iteration for computing eigenvectors; solution of nonsymmetric linear systems via Krylov methods; perturbation theory for linear systems; and eigenvalue and singular value problems with application to nonlinear problems. She established the class of multiplicative perturbations which have become instrumental in the analysis of high accuracy matrix computations; and established an algorithmic classification that lead to the development of high accuracy rank revealing QR algorithms.  
 Ilse Ipsen is well known for her work on the Google PageRank algorithm, often described as “the world’s largest matrix problem”. In collaboration with physicists, she tackled the notoriously difficult numerical computation of characteristic polynomials, which are required in nuclear lattice simulations and the study of fermions.  
 More recently, she has been instrumental in introducing probability theory and statistics into numerical linear algebra for: the design and analysis of fast randomized least squares/regression algorithms in the context of large-scale data science problems; statistical roundoff error analysis for realistic bounds in the context of emerging mixed and low precision processors; and probabilistic numeric linear solvers that generate probability distributions for propagating numerical errors through computational pipelines.  
 Professor Ipsen received a Bachelor’s degree from the University of Kaiserslautern, Germany; and a Ph.D. from The Pennsylvania State University, USA, both in Computer Science. After 10 years on the Computer Science faculty at Yale University, she is now a Professor of Mathematics at North Carolina State University, USA.  
 Awards and honors   
 Professor Ipsen is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a Fellow of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.  
 The Olga Taussky-Todd Lecture   
 The Olga Taussky-Todd Lecture is one of the invited lectures at the International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics. This honour is conferred on a “woman who has made outstanding contributions in applied mathematics and/or scientific computation”. The lecture is named in tribute to the memory of Olga Taussky-Todd, whose scientific legacy is in both theoretical and applied mathematics, and whose work exemplifies the qualities to be recognized.

 Local Information   
  
 Host City, Tokyo  
 Tokyo is one of the world’s largest cities offering visitors a uniquely eclectic mix of traditional and contemporary attractions. The city has something for everyone. Its cleanliness and safety are well-known and it is full of attractions, historic and modern. During every visit to the city, there is a new and exciting discovery. From the famous cat café to ancient shrines, to designer shops and traditional restaurants, there are numerous places to visit and enjoy.  
 Many research laboratories of various companies are located in Tokyo. For instance, Hitachi Research & Development Group has the Global Center for Social Innovation – Tokyo, and its Collaborative Creation Space. The Toshiba Science Museum is also located in the Greater Tokyo area. ICIAM participants will have the opportunity to visit them and discuss mathematical topics with researchers in industry.  
 A metropolis full of attractions like no other  
 Tokyo is known as one of Asia’s most modern cities, but traditions and cultures passed down from the Samurai period can still be seen and experienced. The city is a fast-paced cultural hub where what’s new and modern sits alongside historical gems. Tokyo offers visitors a uniquely eclectic mix of traditional and contemporary attractions, including world-renowned, exceptional Japanese cuisine.  
 Delicious, delicate, and diverse cuisines  
   
  Tokyo is without doubt one of the world’s gourmet paradises. Guests will be overwhelmed by the sheer range of choices for dining, with 100,000 restaurants offering tempting delights from around the world. In addition, you can experience the finest restaurants and highest culinary standards in the world. Of course, there is no better place in the world to enjoy sushi, tempura, sukiyaki and other traditional delicacies, and to experience authentic Japanese flavors.  
 Shopping  
   
  There are countless opportunities for visitors to shop for the beautiful and innovative products for which  
  Japan is world-famous: exquisite green teas and traditional sweets, attractive lacquerware and textiles  
  as well as fashion, from the classic to the avant-garde, in addition to state-of-the-art electronics products. Crossing through the Ginza shopping district, home to the biggest brand-name stores, the oldest department store in the world, and the Sony building, leads to Akihabara’s “Electric Town”, where multi-storied mega-stores and backstreet specialist shops deal in the latest electronics and coolest pop-culture  
  trends.  
 Tokyo at night  
   
  As dusk falls, Tokyo is transformed into a city of bright lights. Many observation decks in towers  
  and tall buildings are open till late, providing great vantage points for lovely night views. An  
  evening stroll through the streets of Shinjuku, Ginza or Shibuya – Tokyo’s best-known  
  nightlife districts – is a great way to see the city after dusk and enjoy the myriad of neon lights.  
  Visitors who want to “act like the locals” can enjoy the izakaya (local pubs) for a Japanese beer and yakitori (grilled chicken on a skewer) or visit a karaoke lounge for their own private sing-athon party. Guaranteed fun stories for the folks back home!  
 Arts & culture, traditional themes  
   
  Tokyo has dozens of museums spanning nearly every topic and interest with many offering glimpses into Japan’s rich and diverse history. For the more contemporary minded, there is an impressive number of smaller museums and galleries showcasing home-grown artists. Ueno Park is the most famous spot with various museums gathered in one area and we recommend visiting there if you are interested in arts and culture.  
 If you want to know more about Japanese traditional culture such as Kabuki, Noh and Sumo, there are various  
  places in Tokyo where you can encounter them.  
 Overall Affordability  
 Tokyo offers quality goods and services suited for all budgets, and participants are sure to find good value for money. Although Tokyo used to be recognized as one of the most expensive cities in the world, prices are no longer high compared with other big cities. The Starbucks index shows that a Starbucks latte in Japan costs less than in other global mega cities such as Paris, Sydney, Beijing and Seoul.  
 Subway fare  
 A single Tokyo Metro fare of less than USD 3 will get you to most destinations within central Tokyo. The city’s subway and railway services are among the best in the world; they are not only inexpensive but also frequent, reliable and clean, and have multilingual signs.  
 Meals  
 To satisfy the demanding taste buds of locals and international visitors, restaurants, cafes and bars strive to serve quality food and drinks at affordable prices.

  The difference between the two types of local booths is only in their location; there is no difference in their function.  
   
  A single local booth  measures 3×2 m with a modular structure, a table, 2 chairs, and an electrical plug. Local booths can only be visited by participants who visit onsite. A limited number of single booths are available.  
   
  A single online booth  , provided by Zoom Events  . Online booths can be advertised over Zoom, and in PDF files, etc. All participants will receive a ticket to access the online venue, allowing them to visit your online booth. Online participants are more likely to attend talks hosted by Zoom Events, increasing the likelihood of visits to your booth. However, it is uncertain whether local participants will choose to visit the online venue.

 Calls for Minisymposia, Contributed Talks, Posters and Others   
  
 Call for Minisymposia  
 What is a Minisymposium  
 A minisymposium is composed of one or a few sessions (up to three sessions) of coordinated presentations on a single topic of interest and importance in industrial and applied mathematics. Each session within a minisymposium should include four presentations in two hours  100 minutes  . Each speaker should be allotted 25 minutes  20 minutes   for their presentation, with an additional 5 minutes for discussion.  
 An “industrial minisymposium” is a form of a minisymposium whose main objective is to visualize the current situation/state of industrial mathematics transfer around the world through the presentation of successful real-world collaborations with industry. The structure of an industrial minisymposium is the same as that of a standard minisymposium. For details, see the section “Industrial Minisymposia”.  
 Prospective minisymposium organizers are asked to submit a proposal consisting of a title, a description (not to exceed 100 words), and a list of speakers and titles of their presentations, using the online submission form at the ICIAM 2023 webpage: https://iciam2023.org/1225    
 The Local Scientific Program Committee will referee all minisymposium proposals. Upon acceptance of the proposal, each minisymposium speaker will be asked to submit a 75-word abstract.  
 To ensure balance, ICIAM 2023 prefers that a single individual not be the organizer of more than one minisymposium. In addition, ICIAM 2023 discourages minisymposia in which most of the speakers come from the same organization or if all co-authors on the papers being presented in a minisymposium are from the same organization.  
 Important Dates  
 All deadlines are at midnight AoE (Anywhere on Earth).  
 Submissions open on April 1, 2022 
  Closing date for submissions of proposals: | December 23, 2022 | February 20, 2023 
  Acceptance notification for proposals: within one month after submission of each proposal 
  Closing date for submissions of abstracts from speakers: | March 15, 2023 | April 20, 2023 
  Registration fees for speakers are due on July 20, 2023 (Speakers who have not registered at that date will have their talks removed from the program.) 
  The schedule of minisymposia is planned to be made available from May – June, 2023.  
 Important Notices  
 Limitation of the number of talks by each participant: Each participant is limited to presenting at most one talk during the congress (ICIAM 2023), including talks in contributed talks, this is in order to provide the opportunity for everyone to present their research. Note that talks in industrial minisymposia and industrial contributed talks as well as invited talks are excluded from this limitation. If you are invited to speak in more than one minisymposium, we suggest you use the opportunity to nominate a colleague or student to speak about your work. 
  Conference format: In principle, ICIAM 2023 will be held in a hybrid conference format, i.e., a session in a minisymposium may mix on-site and online talks. If the situation demands, we will switch the conference format to an online format. Even if that is the case, ICIAM 2023 will not reimburse any expenses including travel expenses and hotel charges of participants. 
  Registration fee refunds: See “ | Cancellation and Refund Policy | ”. 
  No exemption from payment of registration fee: ICIAM 2023 will not be able to waive the registration fee for minisymposium organizers and speakers, or reimburse their expenses. Therefore, minisymposium organizers should make no financial commitments on behalf of ICIAM 2023 when organizing their minisymposium. 
  Submission  
 Proposals for ICIAM 2023 minisymposia can be submitted via here   .  
 Organizing a Minisymposium  
 Those interested in organizing a minisymposium should submit a proposal to the Local Scientific Program Committee by no later than the due date. Organizers will select the topics to be addressed, obtain speakers for those topics, decide with each speaker on the title of his/her presentation, and provide other information as needed. Organizers are especially encouraged to include speakers from more than one country and from underrepresented groups, including women and minorities, whenever appropriate.  
 A minisymposium may have up to four organizers, who can also be speakers, and chair the sessions. In conducting the minisymposium, one of the session organizers should provide an overview of the minisymposium, introduce the speakers, and provide an opportunity for discussion among the speakers and the audience.  
 Prospective minisymposium organizers should seriously consider the following recommendations when selecting speakers in a minisymposium:  
 Speakers should be selected primarily for their current contributions to the topic area. 
  Speakers should be as representative of researchers in the area as is practical. 
  Minisymposium organizers should select the first speaker who can provide an overview of the topic area, put the whole area in perspective, particularly regarding applications, and suggest new venues for sustainable research and applications. It is recommended that one of the minisymposium organizers becomes the first speaker. 
  Guidelines for Preparing a Minisymposium Proposal  
 Only one of the minisymposium organizers will be the contact person with the organization. The contact person should fill out the online submission form and provide the following information:  
 Contact person: Provide full name, title, affiliation, address, and e-mail address. All correspondence regarding the minisymposium will be sent to the e-mail address of the contact person.  
 A minisymposium can have up to four organizers. When filling out the online submission form, please assign a contact person.  
 Title of the minisymposium: Describe the subject of your minisymposium as accurately and specifically as possible in no more than ten words.  
 Abstract: Describe your minisymposium in no more than 100 words. The summary should be written to attract those who specifically work on your topic as well as those who work in related areas. It is suggested that you explain the problem area to be addressed by the speakers and why it is important in significant applications; identify current directions of research and methods being developed to solve problems, including their advantages and shortcomings; and describe the scope of your minisymposium.  
 Speakers: Provide full name, affiliation, country, and e-mail address of each speaker and the title of their presentation.  
 For industrial minisymposia: Provide at most three key words. One IMA option must be selected. At most two items in the list of Economic Activities and/or Societal Challenges may be selected.  
 Industrial Minisymposia  
 As mentioned above, an industrial minisymposium is a form of a minisymposium.

 Organizers  
 JSIAM  

 JSIAM, the Japan Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, was established in April 1990, and is the central organization for industrial and applied mathematicians in Japan. It currently has approximately 1300 individual members and 23 corporate members including Toyota, Nissan, Hitachi, NEC, and Canon. The JSIAM’s objective is to foster the mathematical sciences and engineering mathematics which contribute to the innovation of science and technology. It is a cross-disciplinary society consisting of people researching mathematical phenomena (in mathematics as well as in other sciences), those who apply mathematics (engineering, technology), and those who develop methods of analysis (computer science, experimental science).  
 Both the JSIAM and the MSJ are registered members of the Science Council of Japan, which is the governmental body administering the promotion and enhancement of sciences in Japan. Members of both societies have actively attended past ICIAM congresses since their inception, with recent ICIAMs attracting around 100 participants from Japan. Furthermore, both societies have sent representatives to every ICIAM Board Meeting.  
 MSJ  

 MSJ, The Mathematical Society of Japan, founded in 1877, is one of the oldest academic societies in Japan. Currently, the MSJ has more than 5,000 individual and institutional members. It organized the International Congress of Mathematicians in Kyoto in 1990 with great success. The MSJ conducts various activities to support mathematical research and education, thereby contributing to science and culture in general. It holds two annual meetings and organizes workshops/seminars, such as the Takagi Lectures and the MSJ-Seasonal Institutes. The MSJ’s activities include: (1) publishing journals, conference proceedings and books, (2) commending, through various awards, mathematicians who have made significant achievements in pure and applied mathematics, and (3) holding public lectures and seminars for a general audiences. As a body of professionals with mathematical expertise, the MSJ has been making policy proposals to the Japanese Government in order to improve the national education and research environment of mathematical sciences. The MSJ is also committed to a global agenda through its international activities. For example, members of the MSJ actively participate in international conferences such as the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) and the Asian Mathematical Conference (AMC). Furthermore, Dr. Shigefumi Mori, a member of the MSJ, was elected as president of the International Mathematical Union (IMU), the first ever from Asia.  
 SCJ  

 The Science Council of Japan (The SCJ) is the representative organization of Japanese scientist community ranging over all fields of sciences subsuming humanities, social sciences, life sciences, natural sciences, and engineering.
