 Description:  
 The new generation of generative AI models offers interactive opportunities that may fulfill long-standing aspirations in human-computer interaction and open doors to new forms of interaction that we have yet to imagine. The UIST community has a unique vantage point that can lead to critical contributions in envisioning a future of interactive computing that appropriately leverages the power of these new generative AI models. However, we are only just beginning to understand the research area that exists at the intersection of interaction and generative AI. By bringing together members of the UIST community interested in this intersection, we seek to initiate discussions on the potential of generative AI in architecting new forms of interactions. Key topics of interest include the exploration of novel categories of interactions made possible by generative AI, the development of methods for enabling more powerful and direct user control of generative AI, and the identification of model and architecture requirements for generative AI in interaction literature. The workshop will foster community building and produce concrete deliverables, including a research agenda, model/architecture requirements, and a simulated debate generated by a generative agent architecture.

 Description:  
 Electro-actuated materials (EAMs) have received wide attention within material science and soft robotics for their ability to dynamically change physical properties, such as shape and stiffness, in response to electrical stimuli. While researchers begun exploring the haptic characteristics of EAMs, their integration into Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) shows challenges, including limited commercial availability and a lack of interdisciplinary knowledge exchange. This workshop specifically focuses on electrostatic (ES), soft electrohydraulic (SEH), and electroosmotic (EO) actuators. By bringing together researchers in the field, we aim to facilitate the exchange of findings, techniques, fabrication practices, and tacit knowledge within the HCI community. The workshop combines interactive demos, focused discussions, and hands-on ideation, providing a platform to explore the haptic potential of EAMs, identify key challenges and opportunities, and envision how these programmable materials can unlock new haptic interactions and interfaces.

 Description:  
 This workshop provides the first opportunity for the UIST community to discuss sustainability challenges and opportunities in rapid prototyping. We will discuss key issues such as waste generation from intermediate prototypes, strategies for sustainable materials, circular prototyping (e.g., promoting re-use of components), knowledge sharing infrastructures (e.g., open-sourcing hardware), and so forth. The goal is to identify potential HCI research directions that can foster a more sustainable “making” environment inside of labs and beyond.

 Description:  
 This workshop aims to unite experts and practitioners in XR and AI to envision the future of AI-enabled virtual, augmented, and mixed reality experiences. Our expansive discussion includes a variety of key topics: Generative XR, Large Language Models (LLMs) for XR, Adaptive and Context-Aware XR, Explainable AI for XR, and harnessing AI to enhance and prototype XR experiences. We aim to identify the opportunities and challenges of how recent advances of AI could bring new XR experiences, which cannot be done before, with a keen focus on the seamless blending of our digital and physical worlds.
