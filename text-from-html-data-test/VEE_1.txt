  Call For Papers   
   
 The 18th ACM SIGPLAN/SIGOPS International Conference on Virtual Execution Environments (VEE’22) brings together researchers in the broad area of virtualization. This area includes topics such as compiler-based virtual machines (JVM, CLR, LLVM, etc.), operating system abstractions for virtualization (processes, containers), hardware accelerated system virtual machines (paravirtualization, hypervisors), translators, machine emulators, and simulators. Although these layers have different design and implementation techniques, the fundamental challenges and insights tend to be similar. We invite authors to submit original papers related to virtualization across all layers of the software stack down to the microarchitectural level. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to): architecture support for virtualization; compiler and programming language support for virtualization; managed runtimes and virtual machines; management technologies for virtual environments; memory management; operating system support for virtualization; performance analysis and debugging for virtual environments; runtime system support for virtualization; security and virtual environments, including TEE-based VMs; virtual and kernel-bypass I/O, storage, and networking; virtualization and runtime systems for mobile devices and smart devices virtualization in cloud computing, including containers or serverless; virtualization reliability; virtualization support for programs and programmers; virtualization technologies applied to specific problem domains such as HPC, realtime, and power management.
