   PPAM2024 OVERVIEW  
 The PPAM 2024 conference, fifteenth in a series, will cover topics in parallel and distributed processing, including theory and applications, as well as applied mathematics. The focus will be on models, algorithms, and software tools which facilitate efficient and convenient utilization of modern parallel and distributed computing architectures as well as on large-scale applications. A special attention is expected to be given to the future of computing beyond Moore's Law, and AI/ML approaches in high performance computing.  
 PPAM is a biennial conference started in 1994, with the proceedings published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Sciences series. The PPAM Proceedings are indexed in main databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, and DBLP.  
 PPAM 2024 is expected to be an in-person conference with the possibility of remote participation. However, we strongly encourage in-person participation, as PPAM also has very compelling networking aspects and a social and cultural program.  
 The organizers will provide shuttles between Krakow airport and conference hotels in Ostrava.
