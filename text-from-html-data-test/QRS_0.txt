 QRS 2023 Conference - IEEE International Conference on Software Security and Reliability  
 About QRS  
  In 2015, the SERE conference (IEEE International Conference on Software Security and Reliability) and the QSIC conference (IEEE International Conference on Quality Software) were combined into a single conference, QRS, with Q   representing Quality   , R   for Reliability   , and S   for Security   , sponsored by the IEEE Reliability Society. This conference gives engineers and scientists from both industry and academia a platform to present their ongoing work, relate their research outcomes and experiences, and discuss the best and most efficient techniques for the development of reliable, secure, and trustworthy systems. It also provides an excellent opportunity for the academic community to become more aware of subject areas critical to the software industry as practitioners bring their needs to the table. The 23rd QRS conference will be held from October 22-26, 2023 in Chiang Mai, Thailand.
