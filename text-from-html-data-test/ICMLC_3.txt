 Welcome to ICMLC 2025   
 Over the years, the International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics (ICMLC) has emerged as the leading international gathering of people from academia, professionals and industry in the field of Machine Learning and Cybernetics. In this annual conference, researchers and practitioners from around the world gather together to interact, to inform and to inspire.  
 Leading international researchers, including leaders from IEEE, especially the IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society, will serve as Tutorial and Keynote Speakers. ICMLC attendees will have many opportunities to network and discuss their research with these prominent peers. ICMLC also provides a quality platform for the broad dissemination of significant research results and innovative practices through conference presentations and published proceedings. Furthermore, authors have the opportunity of further development of their work via journal and monograph publications too. Additionally, ICMLC has research consultation sessions, well-focused invited sessions on leading technologies, panels on topics of great interest to participants, and conference awards for Lotfi Zadeh Best Paper Awards and Best Student Conference Paper Awards. We invite authors to submit original papers that contain significant research results, development work, and innovative practices to ICMLC 2025. ICMLC 2025 will be held on July 12-15, 2025 in Bali, Indonesia.  

  Some selected papers will be published in following journals:

  Publication Ethics - Penalty against Plagiarism   
 We firmly believe that ethical conduct is the most essential virtual of any academic. Hence any act of plagiarism is a totally unacceptable academic misconduct and cannot be tolerated. If an author is found to commit an act of plagiarism, the following acts of sanction will be taken:  
 Reject the article submitted or delete the article from published ICMLC proceedings 
  Impose a three years ban for the author to submit any article to ICMLC 
  Report the authors violation to his/her supervisor(s) and affiliated institution(s) 
  Report the authors violation to the appropriate overseeing office of academic ethics and research funding agency. 
  Publish the authors name(s), the title of the article, the name(s) of the affiliated institution and the details of misconduct, etc. of the plagiarist
