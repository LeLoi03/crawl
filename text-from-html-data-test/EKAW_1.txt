 The 23rd International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management is concerned with all aspects about eliciting, acquiring, modeling and managing knowledge. It hosts scientific presentations about the last advances on the construction of knowledge-intensive systems and services for the semantic web, knowledge management, e-business, natural language processing, and intelligent information integration.  
 The articles presented at EKAW 2022 deal with theoretical, methodological, experimental, and application-oriented aspects of knowledge engineering and knowledge management. In particular, but not exclusively, they are about methods, tools and methodologies relevant to the following topics: knowledge and AI, knowledge discovery, knowledge management, knowledge engineering and acquisition, social and cognitive aspects of knowledge representation, and applications in specific domains.  
 Besides the main conference, the program of EKAW 2022 includes a Poster and Demo track, a tutorial, a workshop, as well as three keynotes bringing their insights into the importance of knowledge engineering in today’s world.
