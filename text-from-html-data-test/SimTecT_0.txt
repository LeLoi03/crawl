  Confirmed Keynote Speakers for SimTech2023 

  Confirmed Keynote Speakers for SimTech2023  
 March 10, 2023 / sä  

  We are happy to announce and welcome the following confirmed Keynote Speakers for SimTech2023 – the International Conference on Data-Integrated Simulation Science from 4-6 October 2023 in Stuttgart, Germany:  
 Mark Girolami    
  (University of Cambridge)  
 Mark Girolami is the Sir Kirby Laing Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of Cambridge, where he also holds the Royal Academy of Engineering Research Chair in Data Centric Engineering.  
 Detelf Lohse  
   (University of Twente)  
 Detelf Lohse is chair holder of the Physics of Fluids chair of the Faculty of Science and Technology holder at the University of Twente, the Netherlands. His research interest includes bubble dynamics and sonoluminescence, cavitation, mirco- and nanofluidics, two-phase flow and ultrasound acoustics.  
 Ulrike von Luxburg    
  (University of Tübingen)  
 Ulrike von Luxburg is a full professor for the Theory of Machine Learning at the University of Tuebingen, Germany. Her research analyzes machine learning algorithms from a theoretical point of view, tries to understand their implicit mechanisms, and to give formal statistical guarantees for their performance.  
 Miriah Meyer   
    (Linköping University)  
 Miriah is a professor in the Division of Media & Information Technology at Linköping University, supported through the WASP program. Her research focuses on the design of visualization systems for helping people make sense of complex data, and on the development of methods for helping visualization designers make sense of the world.  
 Karsten Reuter     
   (Fritz-Haber-Institute, Max-Planck-Gesellschaft)  
 Karsten Reuter is Director of the Theory Department at the Fritz-Haber-Institute of the Max-Planch-Gesellschaft in Berlin, Germany, since 2020. His research concerns energy conversion and storage in the context of renewable energy technologies.  
 Daniel Tartakovsk  y  
   (Stanford University)  
 Daniel Tartakovsky is a professor of Energy Science Engineering at the Department of Energy Resources Engineering at Stanford University, USA. His research interests are environmental fluid mechanics, applied and computational mathematics and biomedical modelling.  
 Max Welling   
   (University of Amsterdam)  
 Max Welling is a full professor and research chair in machine learning at the University of Amsterdam. He is also a Distinguished Scientist at MSR. He is a fellow at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) and the European Lab for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS) where he serves on the founding board.  
 Registration for the conference will open soon. For more information on our keynote speakers please check https://www.simtech2023.uni-stuttgart.de/program/keynote-speakers/  and for more information on the program please check https://www.simtech2023.uni-stuttgart.de/program/  .
