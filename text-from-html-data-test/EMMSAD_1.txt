 Abstract:   
 The Exploring Modeling Methods for Systems Analysis and Development (EMMSAD) conference series organized 29 events from 1996 to 2024, associated with Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering. In 2009, EMMSAD became a two-day working conference. Since 2017, the authors of EMMSAD’s best papers are invited to submit extended versions of their paper, for consideration to be published in the Journal of Software and Systems Modeling. The main topics of the EMMSAD series focus on models and modeling methods for the analysis and development of software information systems of any kind. These are organized into five tracks: (1) Foundations of Modeling and Method Engineering; (2) Enterprise, Business, Process, and Capability Modeling; (3) Information Systems and Requirements Modeling; (4) Domain-Specific and Knowledge Modeling; and (5) Evaluation of Models and Modeling Approaches. The aims, topics, and history of EMMSAD can be also found on its website at http://www.emmsad.org/.
