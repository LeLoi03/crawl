Similar to previous years, ACML 2023 has two publication tracks  . Authors may submit either to: 
Conference Track: | (16-page limit with references) for which the proceedings will be published as a volume of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research Workshop and Conference Proceedings (PMLR).
 Journal Track: | (20-page limit with references) for which accepted papers will appear in a special issue of the Springer Machine Learning Journal (MLJ).
 Please note that submission procedures for the two tracks are different. Please read the instructions carefully before submitting.   
Conference Track 
Submission Deadline: June 30, 2023  June 23, 2023   For the conference track, please submit your manuscript via CMT at: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACML2023  . 
IMPORTANT:   When creating a new submission on CMT, please ensure you choose the ""Conference""  track. 
The Latex submission template and style file can be found here: ACML2023_submission_template.zip  . 
 The Latex camera-ready template and style file can be found here: ACML2023_camera-ready_template.zip  . 
Manuscripts must be written in English, be a maximum of 16 pages (including references, appendices, etc.) and follow the PMLR style. If required, supplementary material may be submitted as a separate file, but reviewers are not obliged to consider this. 
All conference track submissions must be anonymized  . Submissions that are not anonymized, over-length, or not in the correct format will be rejected without review. To anonymize, simply leave the author information empty in the Tex template. There is no separate format for anonymizing. 
It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g., in arXiv) as long as it is not cited in the submission. 
Journal Track 
Submission Deadline: June 02, 2023  May 26, 2023   In addition to the conference track, this year’s ACML will run a journal track, similar to previous years. Papers that are accepted to the journal track must be presented at the conference in order to be published. 
IMPORTANT:   Similar to previous years, for the journal track, the abstract and the paper must be submitted to two different systems simultaneously   for the purpose of review management: 
First, please submit ONLY the title and abstract via CMT at: | https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACML2023. | (paper manuscript need not be submitted here). When creating the submission on CMT, please choose the | ""Journal"" | track.
 Then, please submit the paper via Springer’s Editorial Manager system at: | https://www.editorialmanager.com/mach. | When creating a new submission on Springer’s Editorial Manager, please make sure to choose | ""S.I.: ACML 2023"" | as the article type.
 For the journal track, manuscripts must be written in English with a maximum of 20 pages (including references, appendices, etc.). For the template and style files, please follow the instructions for authors on the journal website: https://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10994  . 
The journal track will follow the reviewing process of the Machine Learning journal. This includes allowing papers that require minor changes to be resubmitted after a first-round review. The journal track committee will aim to complete the reviewing process in time for this year’s conference. In the unlikely event that the reviewing process for a paper is not completed in time (for this year’s conference), the paper will not be considered for the conference and the review will be completed as a regular submission to the Machine Learning journal. 
The journal track review is single-blind, i.e., the authors’ identity will be visible to reviewers. It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. Submissions that are not in the correct format will be rejected without review. In addition, extended versions of published conference papers are not eligible for journal track submission. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g., in arXiv).

Some of our participants are unfortunately facing visa challenges  that might prevent them from joining us in person at the conference. We understand the immense effort and dedication it takes to contribute to ACM Multimedia 2023, and we want to reassure everyone that even if you cannot attend in person due to unforeseen circumstances, your paper will still be featured in the conference proceedings. Our team is dedicated to ensuring a fulfilling and enriching experience for all participants, whether they attend in person or online. We will do our utmost to accommodate any challenges and ensure a satisfactory conference experience for all. 
In addition, we’d like to inform you that your paper will be presented in a 2-minute teaser session for those attending in person. For those who may not be able to make it in person, we will also have 2-minute teaser sessions in separate offline sessions to ensure your research receives the attention it deserves.  
We hope to see as many of you as possible, and we thank you for your understanding.

Make sure to book your hotel stay at the Westin Hotel,  Ottawa conference hotel. The hotel  is at the center of the conference activity, and will allow you to network easily with other conference attendees. Also, it’s a quick trip to get to the program and functions, and just as quick to nip back to your room for a break. Staying at the conference hotel will provide a better conference experience! 
Everyone enjoys meeting in a comfortable conference venue, offering quality service and support for workshops, tutorials, plenary sessions, and other activities. As the transaction for those services and support, the conference guarantees that a percentage of attendees will stay in the hotel. The contract with the hotel then guarantees a specific number of sleeping rooms will be used each night during the conference. If the conference does not meet the contracted sleeping room commitment, the hotel gets paid anyway. Those unfilled rooms will cost the conference thousands of dollars. 
Please support ACMMM 2023 and SIGMM by staying at the Westin Hotel!

AAAI-23 Main Technical Track 
Call for Papers 
 All authors must complete a reproducibility checklist, which facilitates replication of the reported research.
 All authors are expected to be available to review (light load), unless extenuating circumstances apply.
 NeurIPS-22 Fast Track: rejected papers with *final, average* scores of at least 4.9 may be submitted directly into AAAI-23’s Phase 2 along with, for example, previous reviews and paper ID.
 The purpose of the AAAI conference series is to promote research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and foster scientific exchange between researchers, practitioners, scientists, students, and engineers across the entirety of AI and its affiliated disciplines. AAAI-23 is the Thirty-Seventh AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. The theme of this conference is to create collaborative bridges  within and beyond AI. Like previous AAAI conferences, AAAI-23 will feature technical paper presentations, special tracks, invited speakers, workshops, tutorials, poster sessions, senior member presentations, competitions, and exhibit programs, and two new activities: a Bridge Program and a Lab Program. Many of these activities are tailored to the theme of bridges and all are selected according to the highest standards, with additional programs for students and young researchers. 
Driven by its disciplinary diversity, AAAI has incubated numerous AI sub-disciplines and conferences and has nurtured for decades the cohesion of AI. New communities often emerge when two or more disciplines come together in order to explore new opportunities and perspectives; today both are plentiful. The purpose of this year’s Bridge Program is to tap into new sources of innovation by cultivating sustained collaboration between two or more communities, directed towards a common goal. Our interpretation of bridge  is broad and encompasses disciplines both within and outside of AI. Hence, the communities that our Bridge Program is intended to bring together could be distinct subfields of AI, such as planning and learning, or different disciplines that contribute to and benefit from AI, such as AI and the humanities. 
We plan for AAAI-23 to be an in-person conference and are exploring opportunities to complement this with remote participation. Given the volatile situation, however, the exact format of the conference can only be decided at a later stage.

ADCOM 2023: Adaptive, Generative and Bio-inspired AI in Computing and Communication  
The Advanced Computing and Communications Society  (ACCS) in association with the Digital University Kerala  announces the 28th annual International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications  (ADCOM 2023) at Maker Village, Kochi during 8th – 10th December 2023. 
ADCOM, the flagship Systems Conference of the ACCS, is a major annual international meeting that draws leading scientists and researchers in computational and communications engineering from across industry and academia. ADCOM highlights the growing importance of Large-Scale Systems Engineering and provides the platform to share, discuss and witness leading edge research and trends. 
ADCOM 2023 explores the current state-of-art AI covering a broad spectrum of adaptive, generative and bio-inspired algorithms and/or hardware useful in computing and communications. Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can create new content, such as text, images, or other media, from scratch. Generative AI models are trained on large datasets of existing content, and then use this data to learn the patterns and rules that govern how that content is created. Generative AI has a wide range of potential applications in Content creation, Data augmentation, Artificial intelligence assistant, Entertainment, Product design etc.

Call for papers  
The ACM MobiCom conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions in the field of wireless networking and mobile computing. MobiCom solicits papers that address important research challenges and build practical working systems. Successful papers should propose novel ideas to attack such problems through rigorous analysis, system design and real-world measurement or deployment of mobile networks, systems and applications. 
 
 MobiCom’23 will emphasize novelty and creativity while, at the same time, taking a broader and more inclusive view of wireless and mobile systems research. On one hand, the more novel the concept, the harder it can be to fully develop or evaluate all its aspects. On the other hand the more practical and developed the system, the more simple and sometimes known techniques must be leveraged. The review process will take both cases into account as intellectual merit and novelty can be found in techniques, system designs, implementations, and applications. The review process will also favor papers that describe how the authors will provide access to well-documented datasets, modeling and/or simulation tools, and codebases to support the reproducibility of their methods as well as papers that highlight and discuss not only the significance but also the limitations of the work. 
 
 Unlike in previous years, MobiCom’23 will not have separate categories of challenge, experience, and verification papers. However, we do encourage the submission of experience papers as full papers that provide detailed technical insight into real-world deployments of novel technologies and systems. MobiCom'23 will also incorporate early notifications for papers rejected in round 1 and rebuttals as described below in more detail.

 Two Deadlines, Early Notification, Rebuttals, and One-shot Revision 

 MobiCom 2023 offers authors the option of two deadlines and keeps the one-shot revision process to enhance the timeliness and quality of the scientific results from the research community. Each paper will go through the same rigorous reviewing process as in previous MobiCom conferences. The review process for each deadline will involve two rounds. Papers that are not selected to proceed after the first round will receive an early notification, including reviews. After the second round of reviews, the reviews will be released to the authors and who will have one week to submit a rebuttal. 
 
 Rebuttals 
MobiCom will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to the final consideration of the papers at the program committee meeting. Authors must limit their responses to (a) correcting factual errors in the reviews or (b) directly addressing questions posed by reviewers. Responses should be limited to clarifying the submitted work. In particular, responses must not include new experiments, new data, or new figures, describe additional work completed since submission or promise additional work to follow. 
 
 The submission of a rebuttal is optional. Rebuttals will be limited to a maximum of 1000 words submitted in the online submission form. It is worth noting that available reviews will be released at the above-mentioned times. However, additional reviews might be solicited or submitted after the rebuttal period. 
 
 Final decisions will be one of the following 

 Accept | : Accepted papers will be presented at the MobiCom conference and appear as part of the proceedings and the MobiCom website. Note all the papers in this category will initially be | conditionally accepted | . The papers that go through a successful | anonymous | shepherding process will eventually be accepted.
 Reject | : Rejected after reviewed papers cannot be resubmitted until 11 months have passed since the last MobiCom deadline they were submitted to. We strongly encourage the authors to address reviewers' feedback before re-submitting the paper to MobiCom.
 One-Shot-Revision | : Papers, where a revision is required, will be given specific action points and can be resubmitted for the | next | deadline. For such papers, the reviewers will articulate a maximum of three major changes/clarifications that they would like to see. After the resubmission, the paper will be evaluated based on whether the authors have properly addressed the reviewers’ requests. Unlike in the shepherding process, the requested action points may include running additional experiments that obtain specific results and could take more than 4-6 weeks. During this revision period, the paper is still considered under review to MobiCom and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration.
 
 Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers 
The authors of accepted MobiCom 2023 papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee that will assess how well the submitted artifacts support the work described in the accepted papers. Participation in Artifact Evaluation is voluntary and has no influence on the paper’s acceptance, but is strongly encouraged. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive badges printed on the papers themselves. Additional details on the Artifact Evaluation process can be found here. 
 
 Submission Instructions 

 All paper submissions will be handled electronically at the MobiCom ’23 paper submission website  . Authors should prepare a PDF version of their full paper. All submitted papers will be evaluated through a double-blind  reviewing process, with the identities of the authors withheld from the reviewers. 
 
 Before final submission, you are expected to make sure that your paper complies with the following requirements. Please do not violate these requirements with the aim of including additional material: ​submissions that violate the formatting requirements may not be reviewed​.  You can visually inspect a page-by-page report of your paper format using the same tool as the submission system via a separate ​ online form  . After the submission deadline, we will use the same tool to check the conformance of papers. The format checking tool uses heuristics and can make mistakes. The PC chairs will manually inspect and possibly reject those papers with evident format violations. However, no paper will be rejected due to format violations without being manually checked. 
 
 Any papers that do not adhere to the following guidelines may be immediately rejected:

  The 4th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Automation of Software Test (AST 2023)   
 Software pervasiveness in both industry and digital society, as well as the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are continuously leading to emerging needs from both software producers and consumers. Infrastructures, software components, and applications aim to hide their increasing complexity in order to appear more human-centric. However, the potential risk from design errors, poor integrations, and time-consuming engineering phases can result in unreliable solutions that can barely meet their intended objectives. In this context, Software Engineering processes keep demanding for the investigation of novel and further refined approaches to Software Quality Assurance (SQA). Software testing automation is a discipline that has produced noteworthy research in the last decade. The search for solutions to automatically test any concept of software is critical, and it encompasses several areas: from the generation of the test cases, test oracles, test stubs/mocks; through the definition of selection and prioritization criteria; up to the engineering of infrastructures governing the execution of testing sessions locally or remotely in the cloud.  
 Authors of the best papers presented at AST 2023 will be invited to submit an extension of their work for possible inclusion in a special issue in Software Testing, Verification, and Reliability (STVR) journal.

 Keynotes  
 Keynote 1: Lessons from 10 Years of Automated Debugging Research   
 Track  AST 2023 (Keynotes)    
 Abstract  The last decade or so has seen dramatic developments in automated debugging, including fault localisation and automated program repair. This talk will look back at 10 years of my experience from working on automated debugging, starting from evolving Spectrum Based Fault Localisation, culminating to the latest work on failure reproduction using Large Language Models. We will look at how serendipitous encounters led to new ideas, how getting slightly outside your comfort zone can help you, and how best we can collaborate with industry in order to transfer our research.  
  Keynote 2: Automatic for the People   
 Track  AST 2023 (Keynotes)    
 Abstract  Software testing is one of the key activities to achieve software quality in practice. To that end, both researchers and tool builders have made considerable efforts to make software testing more efficient and more effective. We have the tools, but where do we put our money? In other words, what do we know about software engineers or software testers that actually write and execute tests? What stimulates them, what blocks them, and what do they need from tools, documentation, production code, or their team?

  About BROADNETS 2023   
 The current roll-out of 5G mobile internet networks continue to drive forward smart services, machine-to-machine communications, and connected transport. The city’s technology industry focus includes the cloud, big data analytics, and mobility – most notably in the field of autonomous transport. With the evolution of 5G over the last few years, the term ‘5G’ means different things to different groups. To the consumer it’s all been about faster public networks and downloads via 5G NSA (non-standalone); for the new use-cases the endeavor was to build upon high speeds and ultra-low latency facility, building machine to machine and private networks; and for the R&D community effort went in to evolving new software defined radio (SDR) algorithms and PHY solutions and applicable use cases. However, the 5G SA (standalone) private networks revolution did not move to deployment as quickly as hoped to open the era of the Internet of Everything. Visible Light Communication (VLC) and Light Fidelity (LiFi) technologies are among the potential candidates that are expected to be utilized in the future 5G networks due to their indoor energy-efficient communications. The scope of this conference is the 5G-enabled digital society. As one of the important infrastructures of the digital economy, some important progresses in key technologies have been made for 5G network. For different digital social scenarios, key technologies, scenarios and practical application systems derived from the combination of 5G, big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence technologies. In addition, 5G network and information security for the digital society is also one of the focuses of this conference. It brings together thought leaders from industry, academia and other institutions to exchange information and ideas on advancing the state-of-the-art in wireless communications and networking.

  Konferenzbeitrag      WannaDB: Ad-hoc SQL Queries over Text Collections  ( BTW 2023,  2023  ) Hättasch, Benjamin  ;   Bodensohn, Jan-Micha  ;   Vogel, Liane  ;   Urban, Matthias  ;   Binnig, Carsten      mehr...      n this paper, we propose a new system called WannaDB that allows users to interactively perform structured explorations of text collections in an ad-hoc manner. Extracting structured data from text is a classical problem where a plenitude of approaches and even industry-scale systems already exists. However, these approaches lack in the ability to support the ad-hoc exploration of texts using structured queries. The main idea of WannaDB is to include user interaction to support ad-hoc SQL queries over text collections using a new two-phased approach. First, a superset of information nuggets from the texts is extracted using existing extractors such as named entity recognizers. Then, the extractions are interactively matched to a structured table definition as requested by the user based on embeddings. In our evaluation, we show that WannaDB is thus able to extract structured data from a broad range of (real-world) text collections in high quality without the need to design extraction pipelines upfront.    mehr... 
  Konferenzbeitrag      Efficient handling of recursive relationships in ORM frameworks using Entity Framework Core as an example  ( BTW 2023,  2023  ) Killisch, Benjamin Uwe      mehr...      ORM frameworks are a popular method to bridge the differences between object-oriented programming and relational data management. At the same time, recursive relationships are present in many schemas to represent tree-like or net-like structures. This paper discusses how to efficiently build and execute queries for data with recursive relationships in ORM frameworks. Five possible solutions are conceived and then implemented in Entity Framework Core (EF Core), while making sure that they can be used like regular LINQ queries. Next, the solutions are tested with different SQL dialects. The results of these tests are then analyzed by a variety of test parameters. This analysis shows that queries with recursive common table expressions and queries using key loading are the most efficient. Queries with auxiliary property, vertical unrolling or horizontal unrolling are either too slow or only usable under particular circumstances. The analysis also shows that the performance of the solutions is always dependent on the circumstances, especially the SQL dialect.    mehr... 
  Konferenzbeitrag      Explainable Data Matching: Selecting Representative Pairs with Active Learning Pair-Selection Strategies  ( BTW 2023,  2023  ) Laskowski, Lukas  ;   Sold, Florian      mehr...      In both research and enterprise, dirty data poses numerous challenges. Many data cleaning pipelines include a data deduplication step that detects and removes entries within a given dataset which refer to the same real-world entity. Throughout the development of such deduplication techniques, data scientists have to make sense of the large result sets that their matching solutions generate to quickly identify changes in behavior or to discover opportunities for improvements. We propose an approach that aims to select a small subset of pairs from the result set of a data matching solution which is representative of the matching solution’s overall behavior. To evaluate our approach, we show that the performance of a matching solution trained on pairs selected according to our strategy outperforms a randomly selected subset of pairs.    mehr... 
  Konferenzbeitrag      WebTensor: Towards high-performance raster data analysis in the browser  ( BTW 2023,  2023  ) Naumann, Lucas Fabian      mehr...      We present WebTensor, a chunked tensor implementation for WebAssembly (Wasm) compiled from C++ and designed to efficiently analyze raster data directly in the browser. WebTensor allows loading (chunked) data from various backends, manipulating it by aggregations and forwarding computed results in a zero-copy manner to JavaScript so that they can be further processed or visualized. We demonstrate the performance advantages of WebTensor by benchmarking data access and aggregation operations, and compare it against a JavaScript version of Webtensor compiled from the same C++ code.    mehr... 
  Konferenzbeitrag      Optimizing Query Processing in PostgreSQL Through Learned Optimizer Hints  ( BTW 2023,  2023  ) Thiessat, Jerome  ;   Woltmann, Lucas  ;   Hartmann, Claudio  ;   Habich, Dirk      mehr...      Query optimization in database systems is an important aspect and despite decades of research, it isstill far from being solved. Nowadays, query optimizers usually provide hints to be able to steer theoptimization on a query-by-query basis. However, setting the best-fitting hints is challenging. To tacklethat, we present a learning-based approach to predict the best-fitting hints for each incoming query. Inparticular, our learning approach is based on simple gradient boosting, where we learn one modelper query context for fine-grained predictions rather than a single global context-agnostic model asproposed in related work. We demonstrate the efficiency as well as effectiveness of our learning-basedapproach using the open-source database system PostgreSQL and show that our approach outperformsrelated work in that context.    mehr...

 28th International Conference of the Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia  
 Human-Centric  
 Computational design, simulation, analysis, fabrication, and management allow us to evaluate and forecast the performance of habitats with a deeper understanding of contexts.  
 Technology for social good is an agenda to articulate values, behaviours, and attitudes that focus on social impact – placing people at the focal point. In the context of a rapidly changing climate, it is has become evident that we are approaching a moment of no return; a moment in which our fate hangs in the balance. We as a species, and the societies we construct, must take immediate action and work collectively towards a brighter and more sustainable future.  
 CAADRIA2023 calls in particular for contributions addressing the conference theme by discussing the influence of technology on society, economy, environment, and governance pertaining to habitats where people are at the heart of the construction industry. We invite conversations and debate around key questions:  
 How do different computational design approaches contribute to the design, development and policy making of complex societies?  
 To what extent automation, machine intelligence and control of complex systems impact societal development?  
 How does the practical and real-world applications of computational research and technologies advance broader social well-being?  
 The 28th Annual Conference for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA) brings together academics, researchers, and practitioners to contribute to the fields of computational design methods, instruments, and processes to innovate for humans. Contributions focusing on the Asia/Pacific context are be particularly encouraged.

 The 23rd ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks (HotNets 2024) will bring together researchers to engage in a lively debate on the theory and practice of computer networking and networked systems. HotNets provides a venue to discuss innovative ideas and debate future research agendas for the field. We invite researchers and practitioners to submit short position papers. We encourage submissions that identify fundamental open questions, advocate for new approaches, offer constructive critiques of the state of networking research, re-frame or debunk existing work, report unexpected early results from a deployment, report promising but unproven ideas, or propose new evaluation methods. Authors need not support their ideas with full evaluations; we consider well-reasoned arguments or preliminary evaluations sufficient support for the possibility of the paper’s claims in HotNets. We seek early-stage work, where the authors can benefit from community feedback. An ideal submission has the potential to open a line of inquiry for the community that results in multiple conference papers in related venues (SIGCOMM, NSDI, CoNEXT, SOSP, OSDI, MobiCom, MobiSys, etc.), rather than a single follow-on conference paper. We strongly discourage “conference papers in the miniature,” and the program committee will explicitly favor early work and papers likely to stimulate reflection and discussion over something that is ready for publication at a conference. Finished work that fits in a short paper is likely a better fit with the short-paper tracks at CoNEXT or IMC. HotNets takes a broad view of networking research. The scope includes new ideas that relate to (but not limited to) mobile, wide-area, data-center, home, and enterprise networks and that use a variety of link technologies (e.g. wired, wireless, optical, visual, and acoustic), as well as social networks and network architecture. HotNets encompasses all aspects of networks, which include (but is not limited to) packet-processing and transmission hardware and software, virtualization, mobility, provisioning and resource management, performance, energy consumption, sustainability, topology, robustness and security, measurement, diagnosis, verification, privacy, economics and evolution, theory, usability, machine learning, and interactions with applications. The program committee will select position papers based on originality, likelihood to stimulate insightful discussion, and technical merit. Accepted papers will be posted online prior to the workshop and will be published in the ACM Digital Library to facilitate wide dissemination of the ideas discussed at the workshop.

 Message from Co-Chairs  
 On behalf of the SupercomputingAsia 2023 (SCA23) Steering and Organising Committees, we are happy to announce that the SCA23 Conference will be held in Singapore from 27 February – 2 March 2023 at the Singapore Expo Convention & Exhibition Centre. This is the first time in three years that the SCA conference will be returning to the stage as a fully in-person conference. We look forward to welcoming you back to Singapore and to reigniting the personal reconnections, networking collaborations and camaraderie within the global HPC community.   
 Co-organised by HPC centres from Australia (NCI and Pawsey), Japan (RIKEN R-CCS) and Singapore  
  and allied events in Asia and beyond with the goal to promote a vibrant and shared high-performance computing (HPC) ecosystem in Asia.  
 SCA23 is unique. This is also the first year where the conference is co-located with the regional HPC Asia 2023 conference which will be held outside of China, South Korea and Japan for the first time ever. Together with the Conference on Next Generation Arithmetic (ConGA) and a slew of the SCA’s mainstay topics covering areas such as the latest HPC research and technologies, AI, networking data centres, cybersecurity, cloud computing and quantum computing, SCA23 promises to be a dynamic and forward-looking event   
 Decarbonisation, green electrons, carbon neutrality are some of the trending keywords that are helping to shape societies and economies in Asia and around the world. With the urgency for nations to look more closely at sustainability and to seek out alternative solutions to green power generation, lower carbon emissions and environmental conservation, the demand for HPC to power the research in these areas becomes even greater. The theme “Sustainable Supercomputing for a Greener Future” reflects the role that HPC could play in advancing decarbonisation research technologies and solutions but also explores the impact that more supercomputers, HPC resources and data centres could have on the future. Greener supercomputing infrastructure, more advanced data-intensive research and cross-border collaborations are driving efforts for HPC adoption and application in a world emerging from the pandemic, especially in areas like weather & climate change and green data centres.   
 So come and join us at our annual SCA conference to experience a dynamic, forward-looking programme that seeks to prepare the HPC community for what lies ahead.  
 We look forward to welcoming all of you to Singapore at SCA23!

 The Thirty-Fifth Annual Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence (IAAI-23) is a venue for papers describing highly innovative realizations of AI technology. The objective of the conference is to showcase successful applications and novel uses of AI. The conference will use technical papers, best practice papers, invited talks, and panel discussions to explore issues, methods, and lessons learned in the development and deployment of AI applications; and to promote an interchange of ideas between basic and applied AI and the discourse on the actual deployment of AI in practice. The general goal of the conference is to teach people the challenges and solutions to accomplishing something useful in the real world, as opposed to describing a new algorithm. Papers focusing on algorithmic descriptions, rather than applications, are more appropriate for AAAI-23. All submissions must be original.  
 IAAI-23 will consider: (1) papers that showcase novel, deployed applications of AI; (2) applications on a trajectory to deployment; (3) papers that present deployed tools for faster AI solutions development and deployment; (4) papers that showcase original ways of integrating methodologies from different areas of AI for practical realization and future deployment; and (5) best practice papers. Submissions should clearly identify which track they are intended for, as the tracks are judged on different criteria. All submissions must be original.  
 Tracks and Topics  
 1. Deployed Highly Innovative Applications of AI​   
 Papers submitted to this track must describe *deployed* applications with measurable benefits that include an innovative use of AI technology. Applications are defined as deployed once they are in production use by their final end-users and the in-use experience can be meaningfully collected and reported. The study may evaluate either a stand-alone application or a component of a complex system.  
 Papers will be judged by the quality of: the task or problem description; the application description; the innovative use of AI technology; the measurable application use and payoff; and the lessons learned during application development, deployment and maintenance. In-depth descriptions of the algorithm are generally more appropriate for AAAI than for IAAI. Each accepted deployed application paper will receive the IAAI ‘Innovative Application’ Award.  
 Papers in this track may have up to 8 pages in the prescribed AAAI style, plus at most one more page which may only contain references.  
 2. Emerging Applications of AI   
 Emerging applications papers ‘bridge the gap’ between basic AI research and case studies of deployed AI applications, by discussing efforts to apply AI tools, techniques, or methods to real-world problems in novel ways. Emerging applications focus on aspects of AI applications that are not yet sufficiently deployed to be submitted as case studies in the Deployed track.  
 This track is distinguished from reports of purely scientific AI research appropriate for AAAI in that the objective of the efforts reported at IAAI should be the potential application of AI technologies, including engineering considerations. A key requirement for papers is to discuss the path forward for achieving deployment of the technology.  
 Papers will be judged primarily by the following criteria: significance (of the problem, and the tool or methodology); relevance of AI technology to the problem; innovation; path to deployment; content; evaluation; technical quality; and clarity. Authors are advised to bear these questions in mind while writing their papers. Authors are also advised to consider the novelty of applying AI to the particular problem domain.  
 Papers in this track may have up to 6 pages in the prescribed AAAI style, plus at most one more page which may only contain references.  
 3. Deployed Innovative Tools for Enabling AI Applications   
 Within this track, we solicit papers describing *deployed* tools for improving applied AI innovation and deployment of AI systems. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:  
  Trusted AI: Tools that generate explanations, justifications, and persuasions for data-driven models. 
  Papers will be judged primarily by the following criteria: the extent to which the tool presented yields solutions with demonstrated improved quality; lower development, deployment, and maintenance costs; better productivity; fewer errors; and higher ability to scale. Reviewers will pay attention to how well designed is the tool, how easy is it to use and how well is it documented, and how many users it has. Note the focus is on the tool, not on foundational research.  
 Papers in this track may have up to 6 pages in the prescribed AAAI style, plus at most one more page which may only contain references.  
 4. Innovative Inter-disciplinary AI Integration   
 This track is devoted to the integration of AI components with the focus on how the orchestration of methods from different AI silos requires the adaptation of existing technologies to allow them to work together well for application of AI in practice. Papers must pay attention to engineering considerations and, where relevant, to human–computer interaction.  
  Other research prototypes that integrate algorithms and methods from traditionally different AI sub-communities. 
  A clear, objectively the value of the innovation of the integration when compared to existing or ad-hoc approaches. Computational experiments on benchmarks (that either already are or will be made public) and in comparison, with existing state-of-the-art baseline methods are expected. At least a portion of the experiments is expected to consider real-world (not synthetic generated) benchmarks to demonstrate the practical importance of the problem studied.  
 Papers in this track may have up to 6 pages in the prescribed AAAI style, plus at most one more page which may only contain references.  
 5. AI Best Practices, Challenge Problems, Training AI Users   
 In this short paper track, we welcome papers that review best practices when deploying AI, that communicate novel challenge applications, and that review contributions that lower the barrier to applying AI by practitioners outside the AI community. These papers will be reviewed based on different criteria than the longer papers of the main IAAI tracks. Best practice papers must tie the recommendations to concrete learning from prior experience when deploying AI methods. Challenge problem papers *must* make non-generated, real-world data benchmarks publicly available (this is a hard requirement). AI training papers must focus on the particular challenges when bridging knowledge from application domain experts and AI expertise and how the domain experts can effectively and efficiently learn enough about the AI tools, they use to apply them successfully. For all topics in the scope of this track, papers that challenge the status quo are particularly welcome.  
 Papers in this track may be between four (4) pages and (6) pages long, including references, in the prescribed AAAI style.  
 Submission Instructions  
 Electronic submissions are required. Papers must be in trouble-free, high resolution PDF format and formatted for United States letter (8.5” x 11”) paper. Submissions need to be in AAAI two-column format ( AAAI 2023 Author Kit  ). Deployed papers can be up to eight (8) pages plus one more page containing only references. Emerging, Tools and Integration papers can be up to six (6) pages plus one more page containing only references. Best practice, Challenge and Training papers may be between four (4) pages and (6) pages long, including references.  
 Submissions to IAAI-23 should contain identifying information of the authors and their affiliations: reviewing is single-blind.  
 Authors should register on the IAAI-23 EasyChair  paper submission site. A login and password, as well as detailed instructions about how to submit an electronic paper, will be sent to the author in a subsequent email message. Authors must then submit a formatted electronic version of their paper through EasyChair no later than August 12, 2022  . We cannot accept papers submitted by email or fax. Submissions received after the deadline, or that do not meet the length or formatting requirements detailed above, will not be accepted for review. Notification of receipt of the electronic paper will be mailed to the first author (or designated contact author) soon after receipt. By submitting a paper to IAAI, the authors agree that the Program Chairs have the final decision on the acceptance of publication at the conference. Papers will be reviewed by the Program Committee and notification of acceptance or rejection will be mailed to the contact author on October 7, 2022. PDFs of accepted papers will be due on November 18, 2022  . Authors will be required to transfer copyright at that time.  
 All submissions must be original. IAAI-23 will not consider any paper that, at the time of submission, is under review for or has already been published or accepted for publication in a journal or another conference. Once submitted to IAAI-23, authors may not submit the paper elsewhere during IAAI’s review period. These restrictions apply only to refereed journals and conferences, not to preliminary versions that are posted as preprints to arXiv.org or other unrefereed forums, or to workshops with a limited audience and without archival proceedings.

 The Thirty-Sixth Annual Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence (IAAI-24) February 22-24,2024  
 The Thirty-Sixth Annual Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence (IAAI-24) is a venue for papers describing highly innovative realizations of AI technology. The objective of the conference is to showcase successful applications and novel uses of AI. The conference will use technical papers, best practice papers, invited talks, and panel discussions to explore issues, methods, and lessons learned in the development and deployment of AI applications; and to promote an interchange of ideas between basic and applied AI and the discourse on the actual deployment of AI in practice. The general goal of the conference is to teach people the challenges and solutions to accomplishing something useful in the real world, as opposed to describing a new algorithm.  
 IAAI-24 Schedule    
 Tracks with Accepted Papers

  ICAIL'2023 Conference Web site was launched.  
 19th ICAIL - International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law 2023 (ICAIL 2023)  .  
 Organized by  
  Topics  
 We invite submission of original papers on Artificial Intelligence & Law, covering foundations, methods, tools, systems and applications. Topics may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 Argument mining on legal texts 
  Classification and automatic summarization of legal text 
  Smart contracts and application of blockchain in the legal domain 
  Visualization techniques for legal information and data 
  ICAIL is keen to broaden its scope to include topics of growing importance and to establish links to neighboring disciplines. In addition to the regular paper track ICAIL 2023 will feature the following special tracks:  
 (1) a new special cross-disciplinary outreach track on Artificial Intelligence for Empirical Legal Studies  . Legal systems have seen an increasing need to leverage data analysis to inform stakeholders, decision makers, and policy actors. This potential comes with a mandate for credible empirical research, as well as constructive communication, across communities at the intersection of law and data-driven disciplines. The empirical legal studies and AI&Law communities stand to benefit from an exchange of ideas and collaborations around concrete legal use cases, technical approaches, and commitment to using data-driven technology for policy and social good. For this track we invite short and long submissions of original papers on topics including, but not limited to:  
 Use of machine learning and/or knowledge representation techniques as part of statistical analyses of data from the legal domain 
  (2) Innovative applications in AI and Law – Applications that fall within any of the core AI & Law topics. P apers in this track will be subject to the same rigorous reviewing process as regular papers, but the emphasis is less on novel scientific contributions, formal frameworks, or results and more on the innovative and novel application of techniques from AI & Law to real world problems and use cases.  
 (3) Legal, ethical, fairness, accountability, and transparency aspects of AI applications in legal practice, access to justice, compliance, and public administration – ICAIL is committed to not only further the state of the art in using AI technology in legal practice, but also about the legal and ethical ramifications of such applications. This track is intended to facilitate this discourse through the inclusion of case studies, reports on regulations efforts, lessons learned from experiments, technical contributions about monitoring and facilitating ethical use of AI in relevant areas, and other topical contributions. Papers in this track will be subject to the same rigorous reviewing process as regular papers.  
 Paper Submission  
 Papers (up to 10 pages including references for long papers, up to 5 pages including references for short papers) should present contributions from relevant topics. To maintain ICAIL’s relevance in the larger rapidly-moving field at the intersection of law and artificial intelligence, all papers must make clear their relation to legal information, reasoning, or processes as well as relation to prior work and novel scientific contribution, as well as contain a satisfying amount of discussion of their findings.  
 Papers on machine learning or data mining should include discussions of the data, methodology, results, and analysis in sufficient depth beyond merely reporting metrics. Submissions focusing on the reproduction, validation, constructive scrutinization, and extension of previously published works, datasets, and benchmarks are strongly encouraged. 
  It is highly recommended for all submissions that code and data be published alongside the papers to facilitate reproducibility. Program committee members will be instructed to take data and code sharing into account in their reviews.  
 Submissions should be uploaded in the conference support system Conftool  by the submission deadline. For each submission, it should be indicated whether it belongs in the regular track or one of the special tracks (AI&Law for Empirical Legal Studies or Innovative Applications or Ethical and Legal Issues for AI in Legal Practice) using the facility provided by the submission system.  
 Reviewing will be double blind. Papers submitted for review must not include names and affiliations of the authors and not include an acknowledgments section. Any identifying text in the body of the paper (e.g. citing “our work”) should be removed or rephrased to be non-identifying. These aspects can be added at the camera-ready stage. Therefore, prior to submission of the paper, the authors should first register the paper on the conference support system in order to receive an ID number for the paper. Then, in order to submit the paper the paper should be revised so that the ID number of the paper replaces the names and affiliations of the authors. The references should include published literature relevant to the paper, including previous works of the authors, though care should be taken in the style of writing in order to preserve anonymity. References to code and data intended to be published alongside the papers are to be phrased such that anonymity is preserved.  
 Submitted papers may not be published as open access preprints before acceptance notifications have been sent. Papers that have already been published as preprints at the time of submission for review must be flagged as such in the review system and must not reference the preprint in the paper.  
 Papers submitted not adhering to the page limitation or the anonymity requirements may be rejected without review.   
 Demonstrations  
 A session will be organized for the demonstration of creative, robust, and practical working applications and tools. Where a demonstration is not connected to a submitted paper, a two-page extended abstract about the system should be submitted for review via the conference support system and following the instructions on paper submission. Accepted extended abstracts will be published in the conference proceedings. For those demonstrations that are connected to a paper in the main track, no separate statement about the demonstration need be submitted, but the author(s) should send an email to the Program Chair by the demo submission deadline to register their interest in demonstrating their work at this session.  
 Workshops & Tutorials  
 ICAIL 2023 will include workshops and tutorials on Monday, June 19 and Friday, June 23. Tutorials should cover a broad topic of relevance to the AI and Law community and should have one or more designated organizers/speakers. Workshops are intended for informal discussion and should have one or more designated organizers as well as an organizing and programming committee. Proposals must contain enough information to permit evaluation on the basis of importance, quality, and community interest. Proposals should be 2 to 4 pages and include at least the following information:  
 The workshop or tutorial topic and goals, their significance, and their appropriateness for ICAIL 2023

  IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems  
 The IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems (ACSOS) was founded as a merger of the IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC) and the IEEE International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems (SASO). The goal of the ACSOS is to provide a forum for sharing the latest research results, ideas and experiences in autonomic computing, self-adaptation and self-organization.  
 Large-scale systems of all types, such as data centers, computer clouds, smart cities, cyber-physical systems, sensor networks, and embedded or pervasive environments, are becoming increasingly complex and burdensome for people to manage. The complexity of current and emerging networks, software and services, especially in dealing with dynamics in the environment and problem domain, has led the software engineering, distributed systems and resource management communities to look for inspiration in diverse fields (e.g., complex systems, control theory, artificial intelligence, sociology, and biology) to find new ways of designing and managing such computing systems.  
 In this endeavor, a number of research problems and challenges exist related to engineering systems, networks and services based on principles from autonomic computing, self-adaptation and self-organization. One challenge in self-adaptation is to identify how to change a specific behavior to achieve the desired improvement in a reliable manner. Another challenge is how to predict and control emergent global system behavior resulting from self-organization. To address these challenges, novel modeling techniques are needed that help to understand the mapping from local behavior to global behavior, as well as the inverse relationship. Such models are a key condition for understanding, controlling, and designing emergent behavior in autonomic systems.

  ICAIL'2023 Conference Web site was launched.  
 19th ICAIL - International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law 2023 (ICAIL 2023)  .  
 Organized by  
  Topics  
 We invite submission of original papers on Artificial Intelligence & Law, covering foundations, methods, tools, systems and applications. Topics may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 Argument mining on legal texts 
  Classification and automatic summarization of legal text 
  Smart contracts and application of blockchain in the legal domain 
  Visualization techniques for legal information and data 
  ICAIL is keen to broaden its scope to include topics of growing importance and to establish links to neighboring disciplines. In addition to the regular paper track ICAIL 2023 will feature the following special tracks:  
 (1) a new special cross-disciplinary outreach track on Artificial Intelligence for Empirical Legal Studies  . Legal systems have seen an increasing need to leverage data analysis to inform stakeholders, decision makers, and policy actors. This potential comes with a mandate for credible empirical research, as well as constructive communication, across communities at the intersection of law and data-driven disciplines. The empirical legal studies and AI&Law communities stand to benefit from an exchange of ideas and collaborations around concrete legal use cases, technical approaches, and commitment to using data-driven technology for policy and social good. For this track we invite short and long submissions of original papers on topics including, but not limited to:  
 Use of machine learning and/or knowledge representation techniques as part of statistical analyses of data from the legal domain 
  Tools and best practices for data collection, curation, and statistical experimentation in the legal domain 
  (2) Innovative applications in AI and Law – Applications that fall within any of the core AI & Law topics. P apers in this track will be subject to the same rigorous reviewing process as regular papers, but the emphasis is less on novel scientific contributions, formal frameworks, or results and more on the innovative and novel application of techniques from AI & Law to real world problems and use cases.  
 (3) Legal, ethical, fairness, accountability, and transparency aspects of AI applications in legal practice, access to justice, compliance, and public administration – ICAIL is committed to not only further the state of the art in using AI technology in legal practice, but also about the legal and ethical ramifications of such applications. This track is intended to facilitate this discourse through the inclusion of case studies, reports on regulations efforts, lessons learned from experiments, technical contributions about monitoring and facilitating ethical use of AI in relevant areas, and other topical contributions. Papers in this track will be subject to the same rigorous reviewing process as regular papers.  
 Paper Submission  
 Papers (up to 10 pages including references for long papers, up to 5 pages including references for short papers) should present contributions from relevant topics. To maintain ICAIL’s relevance in the larger rapidly-moving field at the intersection of law and artificial intelligence, all papers must make clear their relation to legal information, reasoning, or processes as well as relation to prior work and novel scientific contribution, as well as contain a satisfying amount of discussion of their findings.  
 Papers on machine learning or data mining should include discussions of the data, methodology, results, and analysis in sufficient depth beyond merely reporting metrics. Submissions focusing on the reproduction, validation, constructive scrutinization, and extension of previously published works, datasets, and benchmarks are strongly encouraged. 
  Papers proposing formal or computational models should provide examples and/or reproducible simulations. Papers on applications should describe the motivations, techniques, implementation, and evaluation. 
  It is highly recommended for all submissions that code and data be published alongside the papers to facilitate reproducibility. Program committee members will be instructed to take data and code sharing into account in their reviews.  
 Submissions should be uploaded in the conference support system Conftool  by the submission deadline. For each submission, it should be indicated whether it belongs in the regular track or one of the special tracks (AI&Law for Empirical Legal Studies or Innovative Applications or Ethical and Legal Issues for AI in Legal Practice) using the facility provided by the submission system.  
 Reviewing will be double blind. Papers submitted for review must not include names and affiliations of the authors and not include an acknowledgments section. Any identifying text in the body of the paper (e.g. citing “our work”) should be removed or rephrased to be non-identifying. These aspects can be added at the camera-ready stage. Therefore, prior to submission of the paper, the authors should first register the paper on the conference support system in order to receive an ID number for the paper. Then, in order to submit the paper the paper should be revised so that the ID number of the paper replaces the names and affiliations of the authors. The references should include published literature relevant to the paper, including previous works of the authors, though care should be taken in the style of writing in order to preserve anonymity. References to code and data intended to be published alongside the papers are to be phrased such that anonymity is preserved.  
 Submitted papers may not be published as open access preprints before acceptance notifications have been sent. Papers that have already been published as preprints at the time of submission for review must be flagged as such in the review system and must not reference the preprint in the paper.  
 Papers submitted not adhering to the page limitation or the anonymity requirements may be rejected without review.   
 Demonstrations  
 A session will be organized for the demonstration of creative, robust, and practical working applications and tools. Where a demonstration is not connected to a submitted paper, a two-page extended abstract about the system should be submitted for review via the conference support system and following the instructions on paper submission. Accepted extended abstracts will be published in the conference proceedings. For those demonstrations that are connected to a paper in the main track, no separate statement about the demonstration need be submitted, but the author(s) should send an email to the Program Chair by the demo submission deadline to register their interest in demonstrating their work at this session.  
 Workshops & Tutorials  
 ICAIL 2023 will include workshops and tutorials on Monday, June 19 and Friday, June 23. Tutorials should cover a broad topic of relevance to the AI and Law community and should have one or more designated organizers/speakers. Workshops are intended for informal discussion and should have one or more designated organizers as well as an organizing and programming committee. Proposals must contain enough information to permit evaluation on the basis of importance, quality, and community interest. Proposals should be 2 to 4 pages and include at least the following information:  
 The workshop or tutorial topic and goals, their significance, and their appropriateness for ICAIL 2023 
  The intended audience, including the research areas from which participants may come, the likely number of participants (with some of their names, if known), and plans for publicizing the workshop 
  Organization of the workshop or tutorial, including the intended format (such as invited talks, presentations, panel discussions or other methods for ensuring an interactive atmosphere) and the expected length (full day or half day) 
  Organizers’ details: a description of the main organizers’ background in the proposed topic; and complete addresses including web pages of all organizers and committee members (if applicable) 
  Proposals for workshops and tutorials can be sent by email to the program chair, Matthias Grabmair  ( matthias.grabmair@tum.de  ) by the submission deadline.  
  Doctoral Consortium  
 ICAIL 2023 will feature a Doctoral Consortium aiming to promote the exchange of ideas from PhD researchers in the area of Artificial Intelligence and Law and to provide them with an opportunity to interact and receive feedback from leading scholars and experts in the field. Details about the consortium’s program and timeline will be published separately from this call for papers.  
 Awards  
 IAAIL has established three different awards, to be presented at the conference banquet.  
 Donald H. Berman Award for Best Student Paper  The best student paper award is in memory of Donald H. Berman, a professor of law at Northeastern University who was a co-founder of the Artificial Intelligence and Law journal. The award consists of a cash gift and free attendance at ICAIL 2023.

 ICAIL Conference 2023 Recap  
 30 juin 2023    
 Between the 19 and 23 June, the Cyberjustice Laboratory attended the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law (ICAIL 2023)   in Braga, Portugal. Our researchers, Hannes Westermann and Jinzhe Tan, contributed to several segments of the conference.  
 Hannes presented his work on JusticeBot, our AI tool providing legal information to laypeople, in the main conference. Both researchers also participated in the “Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Access to Justice” (AI4AJ), where they compared JusticeBot’s information quality with that of ChatGPT and presented the LLMediator, a tool using large language models such as GPT-4 for conflict mediation.  
 In the “Automated Semantic Analysis of Information in Legal Text” (ASAIL)   workshop, they shared their research on automatic suggestions of relevant legal issues to users. Finally, at the doctoral consortium, Tan presented his work on the impact of emotions in the judicial process.  
 We extend our thanks to the organizers for the opportunity to present our work and participate in these valuable discussions on AI and law!

 Beware of the Fake ICAISC Conference from WASET  
 We would like to bring to your attention the issue of fake conferences organized by WASET (World Academy of Science, Engineering, and Technology). It has come to our notice that WASET has a history of hosting dubious conferences that lack academic rigor and credibility. We advise you to thoroughly research any conference before committing to it and to consult with trusted colleagues or academic advisors if you have doubts. Please read more at:

 Submission guidelines   
 Papers must present original research on the theory of computer science. No prior publication and no simultaneous submission to other publication outlets (either a conference or a journal) is allowed. Authors are encouraged to also make full versions of their submissions freely accessible in an on-line repository such as ArXiv, HAL, ECCC.  
 Submissions take the form of an extended abstract of no more than 15 pages, excluding references and a clearly labelled appendix. The appendix may consist either of omitted proofs or of a full version of the submission, and it will be read at the discretion of program committee members. The extended abstract has to present the merits of the paper and its main contributions clearly, and describe the key concepts and technical ideas used to obtain the results. Submissions must provide the proofs which can enable the main mathematical claims of the paper to be fully verified.  
 Submissions are anonymous. The conference will employ a fairly lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work are in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”).  
 The purpose of this double-blind process is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, and not to make it impossible for them to discover who the authors are if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas.  
 The submissions are done via Easychair to the appropriate track of the conference (see topics below). The use of pdflatex and the LIPIcs style are mandatory: papers that deviate significantly from the required format risk rejection without consideration of merit.  
 During the rebuttal phase, authors will have from March 22-25 to view and respond to initial reviews. Further instructions will be sent to authors of submitted papers before that time.  
 At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for the conference, and all talks are in-person. In exceptional cases, there may be support for remotely presenting a talk.  
 Papers authored only by students should be marked as such upon submission in order to be eligible for the best student paper awards of the track.

  We present a `user-friendly’ introduction to randomized matrix algorithms, with several case studies that focus on the ideas and intuition behind randomization.  
 The concerted development of randomized matrix algorithms started in the theoretical Computer Science community in the nineteen-nineties. At first a purely theoretical enterprise, these algorithms have become practical to the point that they are being used by domain scientists; and general purpose software libraries, such as RandBLAS and RandLAPACK, are under development.  
 Many randomized matrix algorithms reduce the problem dimension by replacing the original matrix with a lower-dimensional ‘sketch’. We illustrate this on the basic problem of matrix multiplication, and on the solution of least squares/regression problems. Along the way, we discuss sampling modalities (data-aware, oblivious), developments in high-dimensional probability (matrix concentration inequalities, matrix coherence), numerical issues (problem conditioning), and the analysis of the error due to randomization.  
 This talk draws on work with current and former students Jocelyn Chi, John Holodnak, Arnel Smith, and Thomas Wentworth.  
 ICIAM Maxwell Prize Lecture  
  Spectral Approaches to Complex Dynamics   
  Abstract:  
  The weather and the climate, along with social processes, biological processes, and engineering processes, are all dynamical systems because they are governed by a set of micro-rules at the level of individual states that describe how processes evolve over time. Complex dynamical systems incorporate elements of unpredictability (nearby initial states quickly diverge from one another) and emergence (macroscopic system behaviour is not apparent from the set of micro-rules due to many interacting components).  
 Emergent behaviour in complex dynamical systems is typically connected with the appearance of macro-structures that persist for a certain amount of time. Examples of such macro-structures include eddies in the ocean, cyclonic storms or heatwaves in the atmosphere, and the coalescing of societal opinion around a particular issue. It is these macro-phenomena that impact our daily world, but it remains challenging to identify key organising emergent phenomena from micro-rules or spatiotemporal observations. Part of the difficulty arises from the usually complicated nonlinear dynamics of the micro-rules. To access these macro-phenomena, we use a linear operator induced by the micro-dynamics. This linear operator – the transfer operator – acts on ensembles of individual states, and its linearity enables one to access a huge toolbox from linear analysis.  
 In this talk, we gently introduce the transfer operator and its associated spectral theory. We also make connections to a dynamic spectral geometry of evolving manifolds, centred on the dynamic Laplace operator. Several example analyses are presented, ranging across problems in climate, physical oceanography, and atmospheric science.  
  The abstraction of the behavior of a system or a phenomenon into a consistent mathematical model is instrumental for a variety of applications in science and engineering. In the context of scientific discovery, a fundamental problem is to explain natural phenomena in a manner consistent with both (noisy) experimental data, and a body of (possibly inexact and incomplete) background knowledge about the laws of the universe.  
 Historically, models were manually derived in a first-principles deductive fashion. The first-principles approach often offers the derivation of interpretable symbolic models of remarkable levels of universality while being substantiated by little data. Nonetheless, derivation of such models is time-consuming and relies heavily upon domain expertise.  
  Conversely, with the rising pervasiveness of statistical AI and data-driven approaches, automated, rapid construction and deployment of models has become a reality. Many data-driven modeling techniques demonstrate remarkable scalability due to their reliance upon predetermined, exploitable model form (functional form) structures. Such structures, entail non-interpretable models, demand Big Data for training, and provide limited predictive power for out-of-set instances.  
 In this talk, we will review some of the recent transformations in the field, and the ongoing attempts to bridge the divide between statistical AI and symbolic AI. We will begin by discussing algorithms that can search for free-form symbolic models, where neither the structure nor the set of operator primitives is predetermined. We will proceed in reviewing innovations in the field of automated theorem proving (ATP) machinery, and discuss how ATPs can be harnessed to certify whether a candidate hypothesis model is conforming with background theory. Lastly, we shall discuss efforts to consistently unify the two approaches.  
 These endeavors will promote the conceptualization of AI algorithms capable of making the discovery of principled, universal, and meaningful symbolic models, using small data and incomplete background theory. With some optimism, some of these discoveries, can unveil to us the secrets of the universe.  
  Aggregation-Diffusion Equations for Collective Behaviour in the Sciences   
  Abstract:  
  Many phenomena in the life sciences, ranging from the microscopic to macroscopic level, exhibit surprisingly similar structures. Behaviour at the microscopic level, including ion channel transport, chemotaxis, and angiogenesis, and behaviour at the macroscopic level, including herding of animal populations, motion of human crowds, and bacteria orientation, are both largely driven by long-range attractive forces, due to electrical, chemical or social interactions, and short-range repulsion, due to dissipation or finite size effects.  
 Various modelling approaches at the agent-based level, from cellular automata to Brownian particles, have been used to describe these phenomena. An alternative way to pass from microscopic models to continuum descriptions requires the analysis of the mean-field limit, as the number of agents becomes large. All these approaches lead to a continuum kinematic equation for the evolution of the density of individuals known as the aggregation-diffusion equation. This equation models the evolution of the density of individuals of a population, that move driven by the balances of forces: on one hand, the diffusive term models diffusion of the population, where individuals escape high concentration of individuals, and on the other hand, the aggregation forces due to the drifts modelling attraction/repulsion at a distance.  
 The aggregation-diffusion equation can also be understood as the steepest-descent curve (gradient flow) of free energies coming from statistical physics. Significant effort has been devoted to the subtle mechanism of balance between aggregation and diffusion. In some extreme cases, the minimisation of the free energy leads to partial concentration of the mass.  
 Aggregation-diffusion equations are present in a wealth of applications across science and engineering. Of particular relevance is mathematical biology, with an emphasis on cell population models. The aggregation terms, either in scalar or in system form, is often used to model the motion of cells as they concentrate or separate from a target or interact through chemical cues. The diffusion effects described above are consistent with population pressure effects, whereby groups of cells naturally spread away from areas of high concentration.

  Public Lecture 1 on Aug. 20  
 Meiji Institute for Advanced Study of Mathematical Science, Meiji University  
 Abstract  
 Founders of TOYOTA dreamed “Flying Nimbus” that is a magical flying cloud in Chinese classic literature “Journey to the West, Saiyuki.” When I was told about this look-like very childish dream by Dr. Shoichiro Toyoda at the visit to Toyota Central R&D Laboratories while I was working in University of Michigan, I was so impressed by the dream that he storied through Flying Nimbus. It is a sustainable safe and feel safe vehicle made from water and air! Dr. Toyoda asked me to lead advanced research for Flying Nimbus with extremely charming smile. Researchers must be realistic, but they are so dreamy, too.  
 In this talk, various struggling stories would be presented with so many failing so few successful trials to implement this notion in real vehicles applying all possible science and technology, especially computer related applied mathematics. Through this dreamy venture, we have leaned enormous difference between safety and feel safety together with clear distinction between personal and social acceptance. Applied mathematics, especially computer related science and technology including artificial intelligence, would be a key potential remedy to close the gaps mentioned.

 The Possibilities of Origami: Art, Mathematics, and Applications in Engineering  
 Abstract  
 Origami is a traditional art form of Japan with a rich history. Simple and beautiful creations such as the origami crane and paper boat are iconic symbols of this art. However, origami is not only admired for its beauty but also for its complexity and mathematical aspects. Furthermore, the folding characteristic of origami proves to be a functional feature in engineering, making it promising for industrial applications. In this lecture, the historical background of origami will be explored, and the speaker will explain how it is intricately connected with mathematics and how it’s being applied in various industries. Additionally, we will discuss the evolution of origami design through the utilization of computers. The speaker will introduce the techniques they have developed for creating shapes with curved surfaces and at the end of the lecture, participants will have the opportunity to experience folding origami using curves.

 ICIAM Prizes Recipients and Invited Lecturers   
 2023 ICIAM Prizes: recipients and committees  
 The 2023 ICIAM prizes will be awarded at the Opening Ceremony of the International Congress for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, ICIAM 2023, to be held in Tokyo (Japan), on August 20-25, 2023. The Prize Committee was chaired by Ya-xiang Yuan, the President of ICIAM. Other members were:  
 Gang Bao (Chair of Maxwell Prize Subcommittee). 
  Alfredo Bermudez (Chair of Pioneer Prize Subcommittee). 
  ICIAM Collatz Prize  
 The 2023 ICIAM Collatz Prize is awarded to Maria Colombo (EPFL Lausanne, Switzerland) for her fundamental contributions to the regularity theory and the analysis of singularities in elliptic PDEs, geometric variational problems, transport equations, and incompressible fluid dynamics.  
  ICIAM Su Buchin Prize  
 The 2023 ICIAM Su Buchin Prize is awarded to Jose Mario Martinez Perez (University of Campinas, Brazil) for outstanding achievements in research—a combination of theory, practice, software, and applications for solving large-scale optimization problems—and in fostering the development of the optimization and applied mathematics communities in Latin America.  
  Precious Sibanda (University of Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa). 
  Pingwen Zhang (Peking University, China). 
  ICIAM Industry Prize 2023  
 Awarded to Cleve B. Moler for his outstanding contributions to the development of mathematical and computational tools and methods for the solution of science and engineering problems and his invention of MATLAB, which allows industrial users to harness efficient and reliable numerical methods to execute numerical simulations in ever-expanding domains of science and engineering.  
  Meiji University’s Institute of Autonomous Driving(MIAD), Emeritus Professor of Tokyo Institute of Technology, Member of Science Council of Japan(SCJ).  
 His title for the invited lecture in ICIAM 2023 is “Mathematical sciences for realization of origami engineering aided land / sea / air self-driving car with intelligence”. The lecture will consist of origami engineering, machine learning, optimal control and control of plural eigenfrequencies. In origami engineering, it will be shown the most splendid Japanese Kirigami honeycomb which receives very much attention because it is the best treasure trove to produce metamaterials. As far as machine learning, it will be shown his own technology FQHNN(Fuzzy Quantification method aided Holographic Neural Network) which has causal information unlike CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) which leads the third generation of machine learning. And in optimal control, it will be shown also his own method which is only one real-time optimal control method. The so-called optimal control is not used in the real car because Pontryagin’s maximum principle gives the nonlinear equation which cannot be solved in real time. He has noticed the analogy of the new optimal control theory and the nature of the solution of parabolic equations for the first time and this has contributed to pass this problem. As far as control of plural eigenfrequencies, it is very difficult to be applied the conventional topology optimization. He has developed a new high speed and high accuracy topology change method for ride quality improvement and elimination of anxiety due to the absence of the driver in the self-driving car from observations of strain and dynamic energy distributions of each eigen frequency mode. He is mobilizing with his lab members all of these technologies to successfully create an origami engineering aided land / sea / air self-driving car with intelligence. Here he will discuss the mathematical backbones for these techniques which successfully develop the dream land / sea / air self-driving car with intelligence.

  The International Conference on Case-Based Reasoning (ICCBR)  is the premier, annual meeting of the CBR community and the leading international conference on this topic. Researchers will present the latest results of their work and discuss future directions for the field.  
 CBR in a Data-Driven World  is this year’s conference theme, to direct the community’s attention to the need to highlight the role CBR can play in solving current problems and how it differs from other Machine Learning approaches. This year we pose the question: “What is the role of CBR in the modern data-driven world?” Accordingly, this year’s conference welcomes and encourages submissions and participation from members of the AI and CBR communities – whether they be researchers, policy makers or practitioners — on this theme. In this respect, we look forward to a variety of submissions; they could be position papers or road mapping proposals, as well as traditional basic or applied research papers.  
 Welcome to Scotland!  The 2023 edition of ICCBR will be in Aberdeen, Scotland. The program will include invited speakers, a main technical track, a workshop program, a doctoral consortium, and other events, with several connections to the Conference theme. We warmly welcome participation from all researchers and practitioners who have interest in case-based reasoning, including those who are working on related topics but have not previously attended ICCBR.

 Welcome to the 14th International Conference on Computational Creativity, ICCC’23!   
 Computational creativity is the art, science, philosophy, and engineering of computational systems which, by taking on particular responsibilities, exhibit behaviors that unbiased observers would deem to be creative. As a field of research, this area is thriving, with progress in formalizing what it means for software to be creative, along with many exciting and valuable applications of creative software in the sciences, the arts, literature, gaming, and elsewhere.  
 ICCC’23 will take place June 19 – June 23, 2023, at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada.

   Welcome from the Conference Chair  
 Welcome to ICCHP 24,  
 the 19th ""International Conference on Computers Helping People with Special Needs""!  
 Last ICCHP was a great successful in-person event, and it showed that Covid-19 crisis was gradually becoming a thing of the past.  
 It was indeed a pleasure to see each other and engage fruitful discussions.  
 Following that memorable event, we are delighted to announce the 19th vibrant biennial conference, returning to our home in LINZ!  
 To make ICT more accessible and tailoring assistive technology and services to promote inclusion and participation in all aspects of society.  
 Nowadays, “everyone” uses various SNS on their smartphones, often with AI-driven recommendations.  
  However, even in this cutting-edge era, or perhaps because of it, various accessibility issues still persist.  
 To address and resolve such challenges, I am confident that ICCHP is the ideal platform. Here, you can find research companions, discuss your issues, and establish a global human network even more valuable than AI.  
 We warmly invite you to participate in this remarkable conference and share your ideas. We eagerly await your contributions and presence.  
 Come and get involved, develop your network!

 Cognitive Informatics (CI) is a transdisciplinary field that studies the internal information processing mechanisms of the brain, the underpinning abstract intelligence (aI) theories and intelligent mathematics, and their engineering applications in cognitive computing, computational intelligence, autonomous AI, and cognitive systems. Cognitive Computing (CC) is a cutting-edge paradigm of intelligent computing methodologies and systems based on cognitive informatics, which implements computational intelligence generation by autonomous learning and inferences mimicking the mechanisms of the brain. CI and CC not only synergize theories of modern information science, computer science, communication theories, AI, cybernetics, computational intelligence, cognitive science, intelligence science, neuropsychology, brain science, systems science, software science, knowledge science, cognitive robots, cognitive linguistics, and life science, but also promote novel applications in cognitive computers, cognitive communications, computational intelligence, cognitive robots, autonomous systems, and the AI, IT, and software industries. The IEEE ICCI*CC series is a flagship conference of its field sponsored by IEEE CS, CIS, and SMC. Following the past 21 successful conferences on Cognitive Informatics and Cognitive Computing (ICCI’02 through ICCI*CC’22), the 22nd IEEE Int’l Conference on Cognitive Informatics and Cognitive Computing (ICCI*CC’23) focuses on themes of Intelligence Science, Cognitive Computers, Autonomous AI, Cognitive Robots, Brain-inspired Systems, Autonomous Machine Learning, and Autonomous Systems. ICCICC’23 welcomes researchers, practitioners, and graduate students to join the international initiative on cognitive informatics and cognitive computing toward the investigation of cognitive mechanisms and processes of human information processing, and the development of the next generation of cognitive computers and autonomous systems.

 Abstract  
 IEEE ICCI*CC'23: Stanford University, August 19-21, 2023. Themes: Fundamental Challenges to Basic Research on the Theories and Methodologies of AI and Cognitive/Intelligent Computing. • What is the next generation of intelligent computers underpinned by discoveries in intelligence science: General cognitive computers vs. pretrained AI systems? [Ref. 1: The Odyssey to Cognitive Computers.] • May the classic preprogrammed (von Neumann) computers deal with infinitive and unpredictable real-world problems at run-time? [Ref. 2: Cognitive Computing and Autonomous AI (AAI).] • Will the pretrained AI systems (such as Chat-GPT) be able to exhaustively cover the entire state space of machine reasoning beyond the coverage of their training models: Enumerational knowledge (empirical) vs. human knowledge (Induction/deduction-based)? [Ref. 3: What can’t Chat-GPT do?] • Will intelligence science enable AI systems to learn human inference mechanisms rather than let them to collect infinitive factors and unstructured knowledge by so called large-language models? How are the essential forms of human intelligence and wisdom generated beyond big data and empirical learning? [Ref. 4: Intelligent Mathematics.]

 It is recognized that the kernels of human knowledge and theories of abstract sciences have been archived in mathematical forms with indispensable generality and abstractedness. Intelligent Mathematics (IM) is contemporary mathematics for manipulating complex mathematical entities in the brain and intelligence systems known as hyperstructures (H) for formalizing rigorous expressions, inferences, and computational intelligence generation. H are nonnumerical abstract entities beyond those of real numbers (R) and bits (B). Therefore, IM becomes highly demanded across modern Abstract Sciences as counterparts of classic entity-oriented Concrete Sciences. IM is particularly demanded in Intelligent Science underpinning classic AI, autonomous AI (AAI) and contemporary Cognitive Computers (kC). In other words, IS may only be advanced based on IM rather than pretrained AI or preprogrammed technologies, because the inherent limitations of classic approaches may not be able to solve the fundamental challenges towards autonomous intelligence generation by kC. A pinnacle of IM is the recent proofs of the world top-ten hardest problems known as the Goldbach conjecture and the Twin-Prime conjecture by the author. IM has led to unprecedented theories and general methodologies for implementing kC towards autonomous intelligence generation by autonomous inference machines.

 The emergence of abstract sciences as a counterpart of classic concrete sciences is presented in this work. The framework of abstract sciences encompasses data, information, knowledge, and intelligence sciences from the bottom up. It is found that intelligence is the ultimate level of cognitive objects generated in human brains aggregated from data (sensory), information (cognition), and knowledge (comprehension). However, there is a lack of rigorous studies and coherent theories towards the theoretical framework of abstract sciences as the counterpart of classical concrete sciences. This paper explores the cognitive and mathematical models of abstract mental objects in the brain. The taxonomy and cognitive foundations of them are explored. A set of mathematical models of data, information, knowledge, and intelligence is formally created in intelligent mathematics. Based on the cognitive and mathematical models of the cognitive objects, formal properties and relationship of contemporary data, information, knowledge, and intelligence sciences are rigorously explained.

 A Cognitive Computing Methodology for Software Requirement Elicitation and Formal Specification

 Autonomous software requirement analysis and specifications is not only an ultimate goal of cognitive computing, but also a persistent challenge to theories and technologies of software engineering. A cognitive computing model is demanded to autonomously elicit and rigorously refine software requirements in order to generate a set of formal specifications. This paper presents a novel methodology for the design of a cognitive computing method for Software Requirement Elicitation and Specifications (SRES) based on the latest advances in software science and intelligent mathematics. SRES is implemented as an interactive system for capturing software requirements and generating formal specifications. The SRES methodology and experiments are demonstrated for solving real-world and complex software engineering problems enabled by cognitive computing theories underpinned by intelligent mathematics.

 On the Goldbach Theorem: A Formal Proof of Goldbach Conjecture by the Theory of Mirror Prime Decomposition (Keynote)    
 Conference Paper    
 Full-text available    
 Dec 2022 
 Yingxu Wang 
 This keynote lecture presents the proof of Goldbach Conjecture based on the author's recent discoveries: a) The universality and infinity properties of the set of Mirror Primes (Pu) adjacent to arbitrary even numbers; and b) The recursive property of Pu, P, and N beyond classical discrete or random treatments. They lead to the establishment of the Theorem of Mirror Prime Decompositions (MPD) as a necessary counterpart of the axiom of Euclidean Prime Factorization. The MPD theorem enables a formal proof of the Goldbach conjecture to be a rigorous theorem in number theory. The philosophy of this work are underpinned by the basic research initiative on Intelligent Mathematics (IM), which provides a set of unprecedented mathematical means for rigorously modeling and manipulating nontraditional abstract entities in contemporary sciences such as AI and computational intelligence in data science, knowledge science, and intelligence science for enabling machine knowledge learning, autonomous intelligence generation, and symbiotic human-machine societies.

 Towards the Pinnacle of Cognitive AI (CAI) beyond Pretrained and Preprogramed Technologies (Keynote)   
 July 2022    
 Yingxu Wang 
  The theoretical bottlenecks and technical challenges towards fully intelligent and autonomous AI are fundamentally rooted in current technologies of pretrained AI and preprogramed computing. Basic studies in contemporary Intelligence Science have revealed that the natural intelligence of the brain is not directly generated by data nor implemented by predetermined behaviors. This leads to ... [Show full abstract]  contemporary transdisciplinary investigations into the nature of general intelligence shared by human and machines, their theoretical foundations, and novel mathematical means for expressing and manipulating the unprecedented intelligent entities across the real and abstract worlds. It is discovered that human and machine intelligence is dually aggregated from (sensory | data), (neural signaling | information), (semantic networks | knowledge), and (autonomous behaviors | intelligence) in a recursive framework, where the former are embodied in neural structures of the brain, while the latter are represented in abstract (mathematical) forms in autonomous AI. Therefore, natural intelligence (NI) and AI are equivalent counterparts in philosophy and mathematics sharing a unified theoretical foundation of intelligence science represented by the Hierarchical Intelligence Model (HIM), which are compatible to those of human brain as revealed by the Layered Reference Model of the Brain. The unified theoretical framework of intelligence science based on HIM and LRMB has triggered Cognitive AI (CAI) and symbiotic human-machine intelligence underpinned by Intelligent Mathematics (IM). IM has shed light to the solving of challenging NI/AI problems by a rigorous and generic methodology. A pinnacle of IM is the recent proofs of the world top-ten hardest problems: the Goldbach conjecture and the Twin-Prime conjecture. Paradigms of IM encompass inference algebra, concept algebra, semantic algebra, real-time process algebra (RTPA), system algebra, causal probability algebra, big data algebra, image frame algebra, relation algebra, etc. IM leads to unprecedented theories and methodologies for implementing cognitive computers and cognitive robots towards a symbiotic NI and AI coherently sharable by human brain and intelligent machines in order to achieving the ultimate aims of intelligence science and autonomous computing.

 Description   
 The purpose of the “USAM” workshop is to enhance discussions on the criteria and applications, methodologies and tools useful for identifying, evaluating, planning and designing inclusive, diverse and accessibility for all. Universal accessibility or ‘access for all’ is a key component of achieving sustainable development. Conventional transport and land use planning seek an improvement of accessibility without directly serving the real needs of individuals and groups. This leads to issues of transport disadvantage and mobility inequality that translates to lack of access or ability to access key functions and hampering development of social opportunities. These inequalities can manifest in fundamental forms such as lack of access to employment, education or services. Inequalities can also be more insidious such as perceived lack of safety by certain user groups due to their socio-demographic characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity and income levels) that prevent them from accessing parts of their cities and regions.  
 As transport networks have become increasingly complex and dynamic, intermodality and users specific schemes and policies are needed. The concept of universal accessibility is important for the realisation of urban space that is legitimate, vital and serves a wider demographic. This supports the realisation of Sustainable Development Goals 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and 5 (Gender equality). The workshop welcomes all interpretations of universal accessibility from exploration of the physical infrastructure, psychological and cognitive accessibility and perceive and real safety of diverse user groups. The latest generation ITS technologies, such as innovative flexible services and real-time users’ information, Internet of Things, augmented reality, virtual reality and smart roads offers new paths of explorations. The widespread availability of user information and data is also another aspect to for further explorations.  
 Focusing on inclusive, diverse and universal accessibility, this workshop invites critical exploration (but not limited to) the following issues:  
 Keywords  : Accessibility, Mobilities, Safety, Urban space, Cities, Augmented reality, Virtual reality, Accessibility design, Cultural tourism accessibility, ITS, Innovative flexible services, Real-time information, Big-data.  
 Each paper will be independently reviewed by 3 programme committee members. Their individual scores will be evaluated by a small sub-committee and result in one of the following final decisions: accepted, or accepted on the condition that suggestions for improvement will be incorporated, or rejected. Notification of this decision will take place on May 2023.

 The International Conference on Computational Science  is an annual conference that brings together researchers and scientists from mathematics and computer science as basic computing disciplines, as well as from other various application areas, who are pioneering computational methods in sciences such as physics, chemistry, life sciences, and engineering, as well as in arts and humanitarian fields, to discuss problems and solutions in the area, identify new issues, and shape future directions for research.  
 ICCS 2023 in Prague, Czechia, will be the twenty-third edition in this series of highly successful conferences.  
  Standing on the Vltava river, Prague is a political, cultural , and economic hub of central Europe.  
 Out of the submitted full papers to the main track and thematic tracks, we will select some 30% high-quality papers for presentation at the conference and publication in the proceedings. These are published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series  and indexed by Scopus, EI Engineering Index, Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation Index (included in ISI Web of Science), and several other indexing services  . The papers will contain linked references, XML versions and citable DOI numbers.  
 As the conference theme this year is “Computation at the Cutting Edge of Science”  , papers highlighting the role of Computational Science in assisting multidisciplinary research will be particularly welcomed.  
 This conference will be a unique event focusing on recent developments in: scalable scientific algorithms; advanced software tools; computational grids; advanced numerical methods; and novel application areas. These innovative novel models, algorithms and tools drive new science through efficient application in areas such as physical systems, computational and systems biology, environmental systems, finance, and others.  
 ICCS is committed to enhancing diversity and inclusion in the conference, without regard to race, age, religion, ethnicity, nationality, ability, gender identity, sexual orientation, or gender expression.  
 ICCS is an A-rank   conference in the CORE classification.  
 We look forward to welcoming you to this exciting event in Prague!

 Conference program   
 The conference program is ready. Please see Conference | Program  .  
 Trials and testing day: Sept 08, 09: 00-14: 00 CEST (edited)   
 On Tuesday, September 08, 09: 00-14: 00 CEST, we shall have the informal trials and testing day. The active users will receive an e-mail with a link to the meeting in the morning on Tuesday, before the beginning of the event.  
 During the trials and testing you will be able to check your connection, make a trial of your lecture or presentation, and check how the group discussions will go on.  
 As we have announced before, the conference will be held on the MS Teams platform ( see the previous news item  ). If you have already used MS Teams and if your e-mail for MS Teams is different from the one you used in the registration for ICCVG, plese send it to out e-mail address ASAP.  
 The active users are:  
 Lecturers of the Invited Lectures, 
  Authors of the papers for which the conference fee was paid, 
  Participants without a paper who paid the fee, 
  Special invited guests, 
  Organizers of the conference. 
  Please check your status and the status of your paper after logging in. Please let us know in case of any inconsistencies.  
 The time we use is the Central European Summer Time (CEST), that is, UTC + 2. You can check the time zones and time differences for example at TIME.IS  .  
 You will not have to log in to MS Teams (although you can). The access to ICCVG will be provided by us and you will participate as a guest, with full rights to receive and broadcast video and voice. If you have MS Teams credentials you can use them to log in, but if you don’t then you can simply give your first name and given name to be visible as just you.  
 The access link will be sent to you by e-mail to the address you have given in your data when registering to ICCVG web service, or to the other address you have given to us for this purpose.  
 Software platform for the conference (edited)   
 The conference will be held in the Internet with the use of the Microsoft Teams platform.  
 Using the platform is free of any charge. It can be used either through your web browser or as the software installed for free in your hardware. Visit the MS Teams web service  . We recommend installing the software – it will operate in a more stable way, independently of the limiatations of your browser.  
 You can visit the ICCVG conference series in Springer  to see the past conferences. This one will appear there.  
 Payment by card available   
 Payment by card is available now – see “ Participate | Conference fee  “.   
 The International Conference on Computer Vision and Graphics will be held as an Internet event only.  
 This is related to the legal state in Poland, and consequently, at our University. We have just received an information that this state is planned to last until September 30. Therefore, we are not able to reliably plan a physical meeting, so we have made this final decision today.  
 The relevant information will be updated in the web page successively. We shall also inform you about the resources with which you will be able to fully participate in the Conference, as if you were present with us in Warsaw.  
 Please watch the News section  for up-to-date information.

  Paper Submission   
 The full paper review process is double-blind. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submission must not include author information and must not include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent. While authors can upload their paper to institutional or other preprint repositories such as arXiv.org before reviewing is complete, we generally discourage this since it places anonymity at risk. If authors decide to upload their paper to a preprint site, they must do so at the latest 15 days before the conference abstract submission date. Authors must change the title and abstract of their submission to ICDCS so that it is not immediately obvious they are the same.  
 If your submission is accepted for publication, up to 2 over length pages may be purchased for the final camera-ready version. Each accepted paper must have at least one author registered and be presented during the conference. No-show paper will be reported to the publisher and removed from the conference publication. For authors with multiple papers accepted by the conference, a separate author registration is required for each paper.

  Industry and Applications Track 
 The IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE) 2023 Industry and Applications Track will feature high-quality submissions describing innovation in all areas of data management systems as well as innovative and demanding application scenarios.  
 For the first time in the ICDE Industry and Applications Track, this year, all accepted papers will be considered by a committee for the Best Paper Award  .  
 Topics of Interest   
 The track will emphasize submissions that describe innovative industrial advancements in relevant areas including, but not limited to:  
  Information integration 
  Information integrity 
  Submissions that do not articulate the innovative aspect of a product or application project (including relevant open-source software), but rather give a general overview or address a pure research problem, are discouraged. Each submission must include at least one author with a non-academic affiliation.  
 The Industry and Applications Track will accept short (6 pages + unlimited space for references) as well as long (12 pages + unlimited space for references) submissions.  
 Important Dates   
 Submissions due: | October 19, 2022 
  Notification to authors (Accept/Revise/Reject): | December 14, 2022 
  Revisions due: | January 25, 2023 
  Final notification to authors (Accept/Reject): | February 14, 2023 
  Camera-ready Copies due: | February 28, 2023 
  Submission Guidelines   
 Manuscripts must be prepared in accordance with the IEEE format   , and submitted to the Industry and Applications Track of the ICDE 2023 submission website   .  
 Long papers must not exceed 12 pages + unlimited space for references, and short papers must not exceed 6 pages + unlimited space for references. Only electronic submissions in PDF format will be considered. Papers that do not follow the guidelines or are not within the scope of topics relevant to ICDE will be desk rejected. Authors are encouraged to contact the industrial track chairs if they need clarification regarding the suitability of their work to this track.  
 A paper submitted to ICDE 2023 cannot be under review for any other conference or journal during the entire time it is considered for ICDE 2023, and it must be substantially different from any previously published work.  
 Submissions will be reviewed in a single-blind manner. Each submission must include all author names and affiliations. Changes to the author list after paper acceptance are not permitted. In case an exceptional situation arises necessitating a change in the author list, the situation needs to be explained via email to the industrial track chairs, who will decide whether to approve the change.  
 All accepted papers will appear in the proceedings. The best papers will be selected for extended versions to be published in the IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from IEEE Xplore), if none of the authors attends the conference to present their paper.  
 All submissions should follow ICDE 2023 Research Track guidelines on Inclusion and Diversity in Writing, and Conflicts of Interest   .

  Abstract    
 GQL (Graph Query Language) is being developed as a new ISO standard for graph query languages to play the same role for graph databases as SQL plays for relational. In parallel, an extension of SQL for querying property graphs, SQL/PGQ, is added to the SQL standard; it shares the graph pattern matching functionality with GQL. Both standards (not yet published) are hard-to-understand specifications of hundreds of pages. The goal of this paper is to present a digest of the language that is easy for the research community to understand, and thus to initiate research on these future standards for querying graphs. The paper concentrates on pattern matching features shared by GQL and SQL/PGQ, as well as querying facilities of GQL.

  Abstract    
 Subgraph counting is a fundamental problem that spans many areas in computer science: database theory, logic, network science, data mining, and complexity theory. Given a large input graph G and a small pattern graph H, we wish to count the number of occurrences of H in G. In recent times, there has been a resurgence on using an old (maybe overlooked?) technique of orienting the edges of G and H, and then using a combination of brute-force enumeration and indexing. These orientation techniques appear to give the best of both worlds. There is a rigorous theoretical explanation behind these techniques, and they also have excellent empirical behavior (on large real-world graphs). Time and again, graph orientations help solve subgraph counting problems in various computational models, be it sampling, streaming, distributed, etc. In this paper, we give some short vignettes on how the orientation technique solves a variety of algorithmic problems.

  Abstract    
 Assume there is a data stream of elements and a window of size m. Sliding window algorithms compute various statistic functions over the last m elements of the data stream seen so far. The time complexity of a sliding window algorithm is measured as the time required to output an updated statistic function value every time a new element is read. For example, it is well known that computing the sliding window maximum/minimum has time complexity O(1) while computing the sliding window median has time complexity O(log m). In this paper we close the gap between these two cases by (1) presenting an algorithm for computing the sliding window k-th smallest element in O(log k) time and (2) prove that this time complexity is optimal.

  Abstract    
 This paper initializes the study of range subgraph counting and range subgraph listing, both of which are motivated by the significant demands in practice to perform graph analytics on subgraphs pertinent to only selected, as opposed to all, vertices. In the first problem, there is an undirected graph G where each vertex carries a real-valued attribute. Given an interval q and a pattern Q, a query counts the number of occurrences of Q in the subgraph of G induced by the vertices whose attributes fall in q. The second problem has the same setup except that a query needs to enumerate (rather than count) those occurrences with a small delay. In both problems, our goal is to understand the tradeoff between space usage and query cost, or more specifically: (i) given a target on query efficiency, how much pre-computed information about G must we store? (ii) Or conversely, given a budget on space usage, what is the best query time we can hope for? We establish a suite of upper- and lower-bound results on such tradeoffs for various query patterns.

  Abstract    
 Recent work has demonstrated the catastrophic effects of poor cardinality estimates on query processing time. In particular, underestimating query cardinality can result in overly optimistic query plans which take orders of magnitude longer to complete than one generated with the true cardinality. Cardinality bounding avoids this pitfall by computing an upper bound on the query’s output size using statistics about the database such as table sizes and degrees, i.e. value frequencies. In this paper, we extend this line of work by proving a novel bound called the Degree Sequence Bound which takes into account the full degree sequences and the max tuple multiplicity. This work focuses on the important class of Berge-Acyclic queries for which the Degree Sequence Bound is tight. Further, we describe how to practically compute this bound using a functional approximation of the true degree sequences and prove that even this functional form improves upon previous bounds.

  Abstract    
 Enumeration problems aim at outputting, without repetition, the set of solutions to a given problem instance. However, outputting the entire solution set may be prohibitively expensive if it is too big. In this case, outputting a small, sufficiently diverse subset of the solutions would be preferable. This leads to the Diverse-version of the original enumeration problem, where the goal is to achieve a certain level d of diversity by selecting k solutions. In this paper, we look at the Diverse-version of the query answering problem for Conjunctive Queries and extensions thereof. That is, we study the problem if it is possible to achieve a certain level d of diversity by selecting k answers to the given query and, in the positive case, to actually compute such k answers.

  Abstract    
 Estimating quantiles, like the median or percentiles, is a fundamental task in data mining and data science. A (streaming) quantile summary is a data structure that can process a set S of n elements in a streaming fashion and at the end, for any ϕ ∈ (0,1], return a ϕ-quantile of S up to an ε error, i.e., return a ϕ'-quantile with ϕ' = ϕ ± ε. We are particularly interested in comparison-based summaries that only compare elements of the universe under a total ordering and are otherwise completely oblivious of the universe. The best known deterministic quantile summary is the 20-year old Greenwald-Khanna (GK) summary that uses O((1/ε) log{(ε n)}) space [SIGMOD'01]. This bound was recently proved to be optimal for all deterministic comparison-based summaries by Cormode and Vesleý [PODS'20]. In this paper, we study weighted quantiles, a generalization of the quantiles problem, where each element arrives with a positive integer weight which denotes the number of copies of that element being inserted. The only known method of handling weighted inputs via GK summaries is the naive approach of breaking each weighted element into multiple unweighted items, and feeding them one by one to the summary, which results in a prohibitively large update time (proportional to the maximum weight of input elements). We give the first non-trivial extension of GK summaries for weighted inputs and show that it takes O((1/ε) log(εn)) space and O(log(1/ε)+log log(εn)) update time per element to process a stream of length n (under some quite mild assumptions on the range of weights and ε). En route to this, we also simplify the original GK summaries for unweighted quantiles.

  Abstract    
 A probabilistic database with attribute-level uncertainty consists of relations where cells of some attributes may hold probability distributions rather than deterministic content. Such databases arise, implicitly or explicitly, in the context of noisy operations such as missing data imputation, where we automatically fill in missing values, column prediction, where we predict unknown attributes, and database cleaning (and repairing), where we replace the original values due to detected errors or violation of integrity constraints. We study the computational complexity of problems that regard the selection of cell values in the presence of integrity constraints. More precisely, we focus on functional dependencies and study three problems: (1) deciding whether the constraints can be satisfied by any choice of values, (2) finding a most probable such choice, and (3) calculating the probability of satisfying the constraints. The data complexity of these problems is determined by the combination of the set of functional dependencies and the collection of uncertain attributes. We give full classifications into tractable and intractable complexities for several classes of constraints, including a single dependency, matching constraints, and unary functional dependencies.

 Welcome to the website of the 27th International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems (ICECCS 2023)  
 The 27th International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems (ICECCS 2023) is a well-established event that has been held around the world for over 25 years. Over the past years, we have seen a rapidly rising emphasis on the design, implementation and management of complex computer systems which are present in every aspect of human activities, such as manufacturing, communications, defence, transportation, aerospace, hazardous environments, energy, and healthcare. These complex systems are frequently distributed over heterogeneous networks and process a large amount of data. Complexity arises from many factors, including the dynamic environment and the scenarios these systems operate in, demanding and sometimes conflicting requirements in functionality, efficiency, scalability, security, dependability and adaptability, as well as the wide range of development methodologies, programming languages and implementation details. Performance, real-time behaviour, fault tolerance, security, adaptability, development time and cost, and long life concerns are some of the key issues arising in the development of such systems.  
 The goal of this conference is to bring together industrial, academic, and government experts from a variety of application domains and software disciplines, to discuss how the disciplines' problems and solution techniques interact within the whole system. Researchers, practitioners, tool developers and users, and technology transfer experts are all welcome. The scope of the conference includes long-term research issues, near-term requirements and challenges, established complex systems, emerging promising tools, and retrospective and prospective reflections of research and development into complex systems.

 Aims  
 IFIP TC14 aims to encourage research, development and sharing of innovative ideas, models and practices, on computer applications in entertainment.  
 Chairs: Helmut Hlavacs, Univ. of Vienna, AUSTRIA and Angelo Di Iorio, Univ. of Bologna, Italy  
 Full papers are the main media for presenting high impact, mature research with original new results. Submissions should describe novel unpublished work addressing one or more of the research topics listed. All technical papers will be published in the official Springer LNCS proceedings. Papers must be submitted using the Springer LNCS format.  
 Paper length should reflect the contribution and maturity of the submission and reviewers from the program committee will be instructed to judge the contribution of a paper relative to its length. For example, typical contributions presenting significant research advances/results should not exceed 12 pages in length excluding references (Full Technical Papers). In addition, videos are encouraged and can be included in the paper or as Electronic Supplementary Material.  
  See the Springer LNCS guidelines on how to include these. The committee may accept submissions conditionally or route them for a different category, when appropriate, and consult with authors to adjust their paper according to the review needs. Accepted papers will be scheduled for long presentations and discussion at the conference.  
 Works in Progress  
 Chairs: Erik van der Spek Eindhoven, University of Technology and Andrea Nuzzolese, National Research Council of Italy  
 Work in Progress (WiP) contributions provide an opportunity to present late-breaking work, new experimental projects, research in early phases or with more limited scope than typical full papers. A WiP submission is a shorter submission describing the research problem, contribution, and value to the community, submitted as a PDF file. Accepted papers will be included into the official Springer LNCS proceedings and will be scheduled for presentation and discussion at the conference.  
 WiP submissions should not exceed 8 pages in length, excl. references, in Springer LNCS format. Submissions with exceeding length relative to their contribution can be rejected. The committee may accept submissions conditionally or route them for a different category, when appropriate, and consult with authors to adjust their paper according to the review needs.  
 Workshops and Tutorials  
 We invite proposals for workshops and tutorials that will be held at IFIP-ICEC 2023.  
 Workshops  
 Chairs: Jannicke Baalsrud Hauge KTH Royal Institute of Technology Sweden and Barbara Goebl University of Wien Austria  
 We invite proposals in all areas of entertainment computing and serious games research (see conference topics listed above) and particularly welcome proposals  
  that will focus on and promote discussion on new and emerging trends in these areas. Workshop proposals must include the following information:  
  – Short but relevant bio information of the organizers;  
  – Expected workshop outcomes (proceedings, special issue of journals, project proposals, etc.);  
  – Proposed workshop due dates (take into consideration conference schedules); workshops can be scheduled for either half a day (4h) or a full day (8h).  
  – Workshops are open to all IFIP-ICEC attendees at no additional cost, even if not submitting contributions.  
 Submissions need to adhere to the stated workshop proposal deadline. Additionally, to be considered for inclusion in the conference proceedings, authors of workshop proposals may also submit a 6 page (maximum, excl. references) paper in the Springer LNCS format, observing the deadline for full paper submission. Regular workshop proposals will not be included in the proceedings.  
 Tutorials  
 Chairs: Allegra De Filippo  
 We invite proposals for tutorials that will be held in conjunction with ICEC 2023. We invite proposals in all areas of entertainment computing (see conference topics listed above) and particularly welcome proposals that will focus on and promote discussion on new and emerging trends. Tutorial proposals should be two pages in length and must include the following information:  
 – Contact information (name, affiliation, address, phone number and email) of the tutorial organizer(s);  
  – Relevant CV information of the tutorial leader(s);  
  – Brief summary of the content.  
 To be considered for inclusion in the conference proceedings, authors of tutorial proposals may also submit a 6 page (maximum) paper in the Springer LNCS  
  format, observing the deadline for full paper submission. Regular tutorial proposals will not be included in the proceedings.  
 Interactive Entertainment / Experiential Works  
 Chairs: Jerome Dupire CNAM Paris and Andrea Poltronieri Univ of Bologna  
 Interactive demonstrations, installations and games show early implementations of novel, interesting, and important entertainment computing concepts, systems, installations or games, or can serve to showcase results not previously described in the research literature.  
 Both research and industry is encouraged to send in and showcase demonstrators of novel approaches to entertainment. We particularly encourage demonstrations with which attendees can interact and play.  
 Demonstration, installation, or a game submission is a shorter submission describing a novel approach to entertainment computing concepts. The submissions will be peer-reviewed and should be composed of a document with 4-5 pages using Springer LNCS format, and structured as follows: (1) up to four pages for an extended abstract and (2) a final page that contains the link to an online video, a list of technical requirements (including electrical and connectivity needs), and physical space requirements (including display and footprint needs). Successful submissions will be included in the conference proceedings.  
 The extended abstract should be written according to the underlying structure of the structured abstract and must be clear, straightforward, and easy to understand. The extended abstract must contain the following sections: abstract and keywords, introduction, methodology, findings, conclusion, and references.  
 Sections can be named differently, and subsections can be included. Supporting figures, tables and images of the results may be included in the extended abstract.  
 Student Game and Interactive Entertainment Competition  
 Chairs: Erik van der Spek and Mara Dionisio  
 Next to the Interactive Entertainment expo, IFIP-ICEC 2023 also organizes a competition for student games and interactive entertainment. All students up to and including PhD candidate level are eligible to send in their game or interactive entertainment installation, as long as the demonstrator is fully experiential, and the demonstrator is part of a research endeavor. This could be a platform to perform research with, a research through design contribution, or a design exemplar of something that advances the state of the art, but the paper detailing the game or interactive entertainment installation should make clear what the development of it may add to our knowledge of games and entertainment. For PhD candidates, this could be a good venue to have the artifact contribution of your game peer reviewed and published in official proceedings.  
 Submissions to the game and interactive entertainment competition should be done in a 4-6 page extended abstract in Springer LNCS format, that among others clearly describes the research goal, a description of the experience of the demonstrator with pictures, and how the demonstrator advances the state of the art.  
 At least one of the student authors on the paper needs to register and be physically present at the conference to showcase the game or installation in order to have a chance at winning the competition. A jury of experts is formed at the conference to select the winner, and the winner will be announced at the end of the conference.  
 There are two submission moments for the student competition. In order to be eligible for the proceedings, you have to submit your paper by the early submission deadline. If you want to participate in the competition without a conference proceedings paper, there is also a late submission deadline.  
 Doctoral Consortium  
 Chair: Esteban Clua  
 The Doctoral Consortium provides an opportunity for doctoral students to explore and develop their research interests in an interdisciplinary workshop, under the guidance of a panel of distinguished researchers in entertainment computing and/or serious games. We invite students who feel they would benefit from this kind of feedback on their dissertation work to apply for this unique opportunity to share their work with students in a similar situation as well as senior researchers in the field. The strongest candidates will be those who have a clear idea and an area, and have made some progress, but who are not so far along that they can no longer make changes. Also, as well as stating how you will gain from acceptance, both you and your advisor should be clear on what you can contribute to the Doctoral Consortium.  
 The Consortium will provide a supportive setting for feedback on students’ current research and guidance on future research directions. It will also offer each student comments and fresh perspectives on their work from researchers and students outside their own institution and promote the development of a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative research.  
  Current graduate students pursuing a PhD project who would benefit from detailed workshop discussions of their doctoral research should submit a single PDF file consisting of a 4-page extended abstract of your thesis work in Springer LNCS format, clearly specifying the originality of the work with respect to current concepts and techniques, the importance of the work with respect to fundamental issues and themes in entertainment computing, results to date and their validity and contribution of the work (expected and/or achieved) to entertainment computing and/or serious games.

 Computing education, as a research discipline, is the study of how people come to understand computational processes and devices, and how to improve that understanding. As computation becomes ubiquitous in our world, understanding of computing in order to design, structure maintain, and utilize these technologies becomes increasingly important both for the technology professional, but also for the technologically literate citizen. The research study of how the understanding of computation develops, and how to improve that understanding, is critically important for the technology-dependent societies in which we live.

  Modern Concepts of Dimension for Partially Ordered Sets  
  William T. Trotter School of Mathematics, Georgia Tech Institute, USA Partially ordered sets (posets) are useful models for rankings on large data sets where linear orders may fail to exist or may be extremely difficult to determine. Many different parameters have been proposed to measure the complexity of a poset, but by far the most widely studied has been the Dushnik-Miller notion of dimension. Several alternate forms of dimension have been proposed and studied, and the pace of research on this theme has accelerated in the past 10 years. Among these variants are Boolean dimension, local dimension, fractional dimension and fractional local dimension. The last in this list holds promise for applications since it provides an answer to the natural question: How can we determine a partial order given only piecemeal observations made, often independently, and typically with conflicts, on extremely large populations? As an added bonus, this line of research has already produced results that have intrinsic mathematical appeal. In this talk, I will introduce the several concepts of dimension, outline some key results and applications for each, and close with more detailed comments on fractional local dimension.

  Approximating Fuzzy Relation Equations Through Concept Lattices David Lobo , V´ıctor L´ opez-Marchante , and Jes´ us Medina(B) Department of Mathematics, University of C´ adiz, C´ adiz, Spain {david.lobo,victor.lopez,jesus.medina}@uca.es  
  Abstract. Fuzzy relation equations (FRE) is a formal theory broadly studied in the literature and applied to decision making, optimization problems, image processing, etc. It is usual that the initial data contains uncertain, imperfect or incomplete information, which can imply, for instance, the existence of inconsistencies. As a consequence, the FRE that arises from the data may be unsolvable. Taking advantage of the relationship between FRE and concept lattices, this paper is focused on three mechanisms for approximating unsolvable FRE. Several properties have been introduced and diﬀerent distances for determining the best approximation are considered and applied to an example. Keywords: Fuzzy Sets · Fuzzy Relation Equation concept lattice · Adjoint triples  
  1  
  D. Lobo et al.  
  intensiﬁed with the generalization of FRE to the multi-adjoint paradigm in [13, 15]. A complete study on the computation of the whole solution set of a solvable FRE is shown in [15], where it is characterized in terms of an associated multiadjoint property-oriented concept lattice. Multi-adjoint relation equations (MARE) [13] provide a large ﬂexibility for setting the equations, due to the generality of the underlying algebraic structure and the possibility of considering diﬀerent conjunctors for each variable depending on its nature. A given FRE might be not solvable because of diﬀerent reasons. For example, because of an excess of imposed restrictions, the consideration of constrains that cannot be satisﬁed or the imposition of two incompatible conditions. It is therefore necessary to have mechanisms that allow to transform a given unsolvable FRE into a solvable one, through slight changes. We will refer to this process as approximating an unsolvable FRE to a solvable one. In addition, it is important that the FRE approximation procedures can be easily interpretable, in the sense that the eﬀect that they have on the original equation when applied are known and controlled. This paper will analyze three mechanisms with diﬀerent philosophies for approximating an unsolvable FRE and their main features will be discussed. Moreover, several distances for measuring the change made by the approximation processes and the comparison among them on an example will also be presented. The three mechanisms arise thanks to the relationship between FRE and property-oriented concept lattices and object-oriented concept lattices [13]. The ﬁrst one was recently introduced in [20] and it is based on attribute reduction in FCA [8]. The attribute reduction results in FCA were translated to property-oriented and object-oriented concept lattices and applied to FRE. As a ﬁrst consequence, a mechanism for simplifying FRE without removing relevant information was introduced, and this reduction also oﬀers the possibility of approximating FRE. The other two methods were introduced in [4], where a comparison between FRE and logic programming was done. In this paper, we present these procedures in a general framework and several properties will be studied. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 includes the algebraic structure considered in the paper, and several basic notions and results on FRE and concept lattices. Section 3 presents the three mechanisms to approximate FRE and analyzes diverse properties. Then, Sect. 4 considers four distances in order to compare the obtained approximated FRE on an example. Finally, some conclusions and prospects for future work are given.

  Definition 3 ([22]). Let (L1 , L2 , P, &1 , . . . , &n ) be a multi-adjoint propertyoriented frame. A multi-adjoint context is a tuple (A, B, R, σ) where A and B are non-empty sets, R : A × B → P is a fuzzy relation and σ : A × B → {1, ..., n} is a mapping. Given a multi-adjoint frame and a context, two mappings can be deﬁned between the fuzzy subsets of attributes A, that is LA 1 = {f | f : A → L1 }, and = {g | g : B → L2 }. Speciﬁcally, the the fuzzy subsets of objects B, that is LB 2 A ↓N A B → L and : L → L are deﬁned as mappings ↑π : LB 2 1 1 2    (1) g ↑π (a) = 1 R(a, b) &σ(a,b) g(b) | b ∈ B    N f (a) σ(a,b) R(a, b) | a ∈ A (2) f ↓ (b) = 2  
    B for all f ∈ LA 1 and g ∈ L2 , where 1 and 2 represent the suprema and N inﬁma of (L1 , 1 ) and (L2 , 2 ), respectively. The pair of mappings (↑π ,↓ ) forms an isotone Galois connection [22]. This leads to the deﬁnition of multi-adjoint property-oriented concept lattice. Consider the order relation πN deﬁned as g1 , f1 πN g2 , f2 if and only if f1 1 f2 , or equivalently, if and only if g1 2 g2 . The multi-adjoint property-oriented concept lattice associated with the multi-adjoint propertyoriented frame is given by  A ↓N ↑π (3) MπN (A, B, R, σ) = g, f ∈ LB × L | g = f , f = g 2 1 The set MπN endowed with the order πN is a complete lattice [22]. Given a concept g, f , the mapping g is called extent of the concept and f is called the intent of the concept. The set of intents is denoted as I(MπN ) and the extents are denoted as E(MπN ). Next, several deﬁnitions and results concerning multi-adjoint relation equation (MARE) will be recalled. For more details see [13]. A MARE is an equation of the form R  S = T , where R, S and T are fuzzy relations, R or S is unknown, and  is a sup-composition operator. There exist diﬀerent composition operators  between fuzzy relations, in this paper we will consider the following one. Definition 4 ([13]). Let U, V, W be sets, (P1 , 1 ), (P2 , 2 ), (P3 , 3 ) posets, {(&i , i , i ) | i ∈ {1, . . . , n}} a set of adjoint triples with respect P1 , P2 , P3 , σ : V → {1, . . . , n} a mapping, and R ∈ P1U ×V , S ∈ P2V ×W , T ∈ P3U ×W three fuzzy relations. If P3 is a complete lattice, the operator σ : P1U ×V × P2V ×W → P3U ×W deﬁned as  (4) R σ S(u, w) = 3{R(u, v)&σ(v) S(v, w) | v ∈ V } is called sup-&σ -composition. This sup-composition operator is used in the deﬁnition of the MARE analyzed in this paper.  
  Approximating FRE Through Concept Lattices  
  7  
  Definition 5 ([13]). A MARE with sup-&σ -composition is an equality of the form (5) R σ X = T where X is an unknown fuzzy relation. A MARE is solvable if there exists at least one solution, that is, a relation X exists satisfying (5). Otherwise, we say that the MARE is unsolvable. A dual equation can be developed if the relation R is the unknown relation in the equation R σ S = T . If P2 is a lower-semilattice and the MARE (5) is solvable, then its greatest solution exists and can be computed as follows. Proposition 1 ([13]). Let R σ X = T be a solvable MARE and (P2 , 2 ) a lower-semilattice. Its greatest solution X is given by  X(v, w) = 2{T (u, w) σ(v) R(u, v) | u ∈ U } for each (v, w) ∈ V × W In [13,15], diverse results related to the solvability and the computation of the solution set of a MARE were introduced based on its relationship with the isotone variants of FCA. Next, the most relevant ones in the scope of this paper will be recalled. First of all, the following deﬁnition assigns a context to a MARE. Definition 6 ([13]). The multi-adjoint context associated with the MARE Rσ X = T is the property-oriented multi-adjoint context (U, V, R, σ). The following results are based on the notion of multi-adjoint concept lattice. The resolution procedure consists of associating a MARE with a context and, consequently, a multi-adjoint property-oriented concept lattice is associated with it too. The concept lattice (MπN (U, V, R, σ), πN ) of the context associated with a MARE characterizes its solvability. Proposition 2 ([13]). Let (U, V, R, σ) be the multi-adjoint context associated with a MARE R σ X = T and (MπN , πN ) the concept lattice associated with that context. Then R σ X = T is solvable if and only if Tw ∈ I(MπN ) for all w ∈ W , where Tw (u) = T (u, w), for all u ∈ U , w ∈ W . The solution set of a MARE can be characterized in terms of its associated context as was proved in [15]. Moreover, attribute reduction in FCA allows to reduce a MARE, thus leading to the notion of reduced MARE. Definition 7 ([20]). Let Y ⊆ U and consider the relations RY = R|Y ×V , TY = T|Y ×W . The MARE RY σ X = TY is called Y -reduced MARE of R σ X = T . Reducing a MARE in a consistent set/reduct preserves its solution set. The following result is one of the most relevant ones introduced in [20]. Theorem 1 ([20]). Let R σ X = T be a solvable MARE and Y a consistent set of its associated context (U, V, R, σ). The Y -reduced equation of R σ X = T is solvable. In addition, X ∈ LV2 ×W is a solution of the Y -reduced equation if and only if it is a solution of the whole equation.

  ×W where R ∈ P U ×V , T ∈ LU and X ∈ LV2 ×W , with X being unknown. 1 The intuition behind the ﬁrst approximation procedure is to eliminate several of the rows of an unsolvable MARE to recover its solvability. If this happens, it can be reasoned that the inconsistencies that gave rise to the unsolvability were due to the eliminated rows. However, as with reduction procedures, removing too many rows from the equation can lead to a loss of relevant information. In fact, eliminating all rows always leads to a trivially solvable equation, but no information from the original equation is preserved in that case. Therefore, we will use the approach of Theorem 1, which states that reducing a solvable equation considering a consistent set does not cause loss of information. Based on the previous considerations, we will search for a consistent set of attributes Y of its associated context, such that the Y -reduced equation will be solvable, which means that all inconsistencies have been eliminated without losing relevant information. Moreover, in order to eliminate redundant information as well, we will always take into account reducts, which gives rise to the following deﬁnition.  
  Definition 8. Let R σ X = T be an unsolvable MARE and (U, V, R, σ) its associated context. We say that a reduct Y ⊆ U of (U, V, R, σ) is feasible if the Y -reduced equation RY σ X = TY is solvable. Note that every consistent set contains at least one reduct. Thus, in order to include as little redundant information as possible, feasible reducts will be Y N considered from now on. Given a subset of attributes Y ⊆ U , we will use (↑π ,↓Y ) to denote the Galois connection associated with the context (Y, V, RY , σ|Y ×V ). Suppose that an unsolvable MARE R σ X = T admits a feasible reduct Y ⊆ U . Since the equation RY σ X = TY is solvable, it is clear that the inconsistencies of the original MARE correspond to the rows that have been eliminated. Now, the question that naturally arises is whether it is possible to redeﬁne the independent term of those rows and so, preserving the dimension  
  (7) (8)  
  Note that, substituting Tw by an element of Lw or of Gw , for all w ∈ W , gives rise to a solvable MARE since, by deﬁnition, the elements of these sets are intensions of concepts of MπN . The following result shows that the set Lw has a maximum element. Proposition 3. Let R σ X = T be an unsolvable MARE. For each w ∈ W , N the set Lw deﬁned on (7) has a maximum element, which is given by Tw↓ ↑π . In general, the sets of the form Gw deﬁned in (8) have no minimum element and, in certain cases, they may even be empty [15]. Therefore, we will use their minimal elements as an approximation, when they exist.  
  10  
  Selecting the Best Approximation  
  The three approximation mechanisms of unsolvable MARE presented in Sect. 3 are based on diﬀerent philosophies for obtaining a new independent term such that the resulting MARE is solvable. Furthermore, two of these three mechanisms may give rise to more than one approximation, as shown in Example 1, where four diﬀerent approximations of (9) have been calculated. In order to contrast the approximations of an unsolvable MARE, a measure is necessary. In [19], three unsolvability measures were introduced to compare the original MARE with independent term Tw from its conservative approximation N Tw↓ ↑π [4]. Such study revealed how far is an unsolvable MARE from being solvable, assuming the (unique) conservative approximation. The idea here is deﬁning measures applicable to all the possible approximations of a MARE, leading to a basis to compare the approximations between them. Notice that, for instance, a MARE can be far from its conservative approximation but close to one of its optimistic approximations. It is clear that the ﬁrst measure presented in [19] (which will be recalled next) perfectly works for the other two approximation approaches, while the other two measures are meaningless for optimistic and reduced approximations. In this section, we will consider the unit interval as the underlying lattice. Hence, we will use three distances between two columns/vectors for comparing the given independent term T and an approximation T ∗ . Given two columns C1 , C2 with

  Conclusions and Future Work  
  This paper has analyzed three mechanisms to approximate FRE based on the relationship between FRE and the two isotone variants of FCA. The ﬁrst one takes advantage the attribute reduction results in FCA to remove problematic and redundant equations of the original FRE. As a consequence, unsolvable FRE becomes solvable because of removing possible inconsistencies in the systems of equations. The other two are based on looking for the intensions of the concept lattice associated with the given FRE that are closer to its independent term. Diﬀerent measures have been proposed to analyze what approximation is the most appropriated in practical cases. They have also been applied to an example. In the future, we will continue the study of approximations of unsolvable of FRE, introduce more measures and determine the impact of approximating FRE in their solution set.  
  Abstract. Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) transforms a context bigraph, having vertices of type object and attribute, into a lattice digraph, whose vertices and arcs represent formal concepts and their covering relation. The computational complexity of most FCA algorithms is a polynomial function of the numbers of vertices in both the context bigraph and lattice digraph. While the latter quantity is ﬁxed, the former can be decreased by context standardisation, a process which we show is facilitated by the eﬃcient partition reﬁnement algorithm of Spinrad. The Carve algorithm recursively partitions the context bigraph and corresponding lattice digraph by removing universal objects and attributes and their orphans and partitioning the resultant sub-context into its connected components. The associated software prototype uses the resultant tree structure to support coordinated browsing of both. This paper describes an additional, coordinated representation of the context bigraph which makes explicit in its bi-adjacency matrix the pattern of nested sub-contexts discovered by the Carve algorithm. We show that permuting this matrix into doubly-lexical order with the aid of Spinrad’s algorithm groups together into nested rectangles the bigraph edges belonging to these sub-contexts, and facilitates the two key processing steps of the Carve algorithm.

  objects, so that the concepts do not depend only on the individual descriptions of objects but also on relationship patterns over interconnected objects. Relational Concept Analysis [23] combines several classical FCA contexts and several binary relations to form concepts whose intents are similar to description logic class expressions [3], combining object attributes, binary relations, and quantiﬁer operators. Relational structures [19] and Graph-FCA [8] add n-ary relationships between objects (n ≥ 1), and form n-ary concepts, i.e. concepts whose intents are equivalent to conjunctive queries, and whose extents are equivalent to the results of such queries, i.e. sets of n-tuples of objects. In this paper, we propose to merge two FCA extensions that are representative of the ﬁrst and last categories above: Pattern Structures (PS) and GraphFCA. The aim is to combine the beneﬁts of the two categories of extensions, in short complex descriptions and relationships between objects. Logical Concept Analysis (LCA) could have been used in place of PS but we have chosen PS as it has been more widely adopted, and because it is better suited to the eﬀective computation of concepts. In this paper we choose to merge PS with Graph-FCA but it would be perfectly relevant to do so with Relational Concept Analysis (RCA). We hope this work will encourage and facilitate the merge with RCA in a future work. The merge results in a new FCA extension called Graph-PS. It is an elegant extension in the sense that PS is a special case of Graph-PS, obtained by not using inter-object relationships; and Graph-FCA is a special case of Graph-PS, obtained by using sets of binary attributes as descriptions of individual objects and inter-object relationships. As a consequence, classical FCA is also a special case of Graph-PS. It therefore acts as an unifying FCA theory encompassing classical FCA and two mainstream FCA extensions. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 recalls the main deﬁnitions and results of Pattern Structures and Graph-FCA, as preliminaries. Section 3 deﬁnes Graph-PS as the extension of Graph-FCA with PS-like descriptions, and illustrates the diﬀerent notions with a running example combining binary relationships, valued attributes and intervals. Section 4 describes its application to RDFS graphs by deﬁning a custom set of descriptions and similarity operator. Section 5 concludes the paper, and draws some perspectives.

  Of course, this assumes to extend the set of literals L with all patterns that may be generated by the lgg operator, e.g. intervals. On valued properties the lgg operator can be obtained by combining the lgg operators on properties and literals. lgg(p : l , p : l ) = {p : l | p ∈ lgg(p , p ), l ∈ lgg(l , l )} Each lgg operator can be lifted to the PS similarity operator on sets of elements by collecting all least general generalizations of elements pairwise, and then ﬁltering them to keep only the most speciﬁc ones. d  d = Min ≤ {x ∈ lgg(x , x ) | x ∈ d , y  ∈ d } This is enough to deﬁne similarity on D2 -descriptions, which are sets of properties. On D1 -descriptions, similarity can be deﬁned element-wise as they are pairs (C, P L) of sets of elementary descriptors: C is a set of classes, and P L is a set of valued properties. (C  , P L )  (C  , P L ) = (C   C  , P L  P L ) Finally, the similarity between a D1 -description and a D2 -description is simply the empty description ⊥, although Graph-PS only applies similarity to the descriptions of tuples of objects with the same arity.  
  Graph-FCA Meets Pattern Structures  
  Conclusion and Perspectives  
  We have introduced a new extension of Formal Concept Analysis that merges two existing FCA extensions, Pattern Structures (PS) and Graph-FCA. In short, PSlike descriptions are used to describe the nodes and hyperedges of graphs, in place of sets of attributes. The new extension therefore combines the beneﬁts of the two existing extensions: complex descriptions and relationships between objects. A strength of Graph-PS is that it is a proper generalization of PS and GraphFCA, in the sense that PS and Graph-FCA – as well as FCA – are special cases of Graph-PS. Hence, all previous work about deﬁning custom pattern structures can be reused in Graph-PS, and the compact graphical representations of concept lattices in Graph-FCA can be reused in Graph-PS. We have also shown that GraphPS can accurately represent existing graph-based models like RDFS graphs. This paper focuses on the theoretical aspects of Graph-PS, and the most immediate perspectives concern its implementation and its applications. The implementation could be adapted from the existing implementation of GraphFCA [7], by taking into account the similarity operator  in the PGP operations ⊆q and ∩q . The additional cost of using Graph-PS in PS and Graph-FCA settings should be evaluated. A toolbox of components should be built in order to facilitate the design of new sets of descriptions, by capitalizing on previous applications of pattern structures, and by adopting the methodology of logic functors [13]. In the end, we plan to experiment Graph-PS in diverse knowledge graphs and other complex structures like sequences and trees.

  pair ( c, Ψ) is a fuzzy Galois connection between (LA , S) and (Isot(AA ), ρ˜). Furthermore, it is proved that any pair of closure structures (Φ, c) is a formal concept of the Galois connection. This problem is also studied for fuzzy closure relations, hence studying two additional Galois connections, one between (Isot(AA ), ρ) and (IsotTot(LA×A ), ρˆ) and another one between (LA , S) and (IsotTot(LA×A ), ρˆ). In the case of paper [15], the main goal is to insert crisp closure systems in the problem. We proved the existence of crisp Galois connections between the crisp lattice (2A , ⊆) and the three sets of the previous paragraph endowed with the 1-cut of their fuzzy relations. Moreover, the existence of Galois connections and the behavior of the sets of formal concepts have been considered. The main goal of this paper is to study the commutativity of the diagram of the three Galois connections presented in [15]. We prove that, of six possible commutative diagrams, two of them are indeed commutative, another one is commutative in the case where the underlying structure is a Heyting algebra, and the remaining three diagrams are not commutative in general, not even under the Heyting algebra assumption. The outline of the paper is as follows. First, a section of preliminaries to recall already known results that are useful to understand the paper better. The next section introduces the crisp closure systems to the framework and considers the new Galois connections and their formal concepts. The main results of the paper appear in the following section, where the study of the commutativity of the diagrams is completed. Finally, there is a section of conclusions and further work where the results are discussed and some hints of future research lines are shown.

  Preliminaries  
  This section presents the necessary notions and results to properly follow the paper. The general framework throughout the paper is going to be a complete residuated lattice L = (L, ∧, ∨, × →, 0, 1). For the properties of residuated lattices we refer the reader to [3, Chapter 2]. Given a L-fuzzy set X ∈ LA , the 1-cut of X, denoted by X 1 , is the crisp set {a ∈ A | X(a) = 1}. Equivalently, we will consider it as the fuzzy set whose characteristic mapping is X 1 (a) = 1 if X(a) = 1 and 0 otherwise. Given a fuzzy relation μ between A and B, i.e., a crisp mapping μ : A × B → L, and a ∈ A, the afterset aμ is the fuzzy set aμ : B → L given by aμ (b) = μ(a, b). A fuzzy relation μ is said to be total if, for all a ∈ A, the aftersets aμ are normal fuzzy sets, i.e., there exists x ∈ A such that aκ (x) = 1. For ρ being a binary L-relation in A, we say that – – – –  
  ρ ρ ρ ρ  
  A typical example of fuzzy poset is (LA , S), for any set A. If (A, ρ) is a fuzzy poset, we will also use the so-called full fuzzy powering ρ∝ , which is the fuzzy relation on LA deﬁned as follows: for all X, Y ∈ LA ,  (X(x) ⊗ Y (y)) → ρ(x, y). ρ∝ (X, Y ) = x,y∈A  
  Since the structure used in this paper is a complete fuzzy lattice, we require the notion of inﬁmum and supremum in the fuzzy setting. These concepts, originally introduced by Bˇelohl´ avek in [4], are deﬁned as follows. Definition 2. Let (A, ρ) be a fuzzy poset and X ∈ LA . The down-cone (resp. up-cone) of X is defined as a fuzzy set with the following membership function.     X(a) → ρ(x, a) resp. X ρ (x) = X(a) → ρ(a, x) . Xρ (x) = a∈A  
  a∈A  
  Definition 8. Let (A, ρ) be a complete fuzzy lattice. A fuzzy set Φ ∈ LA is said to be a fuzzy closure system if Φ1 is a closure system and Φ is the extensional hull of Φ1 . This deﬁnition of fuzzy closure system maintains the well-known one-to-one relationship between closure systems and closure operators [14]. Theorem 3. Let (A, ρ) be a complete fuzzy lattice. The following assertions hold: 1. If c is a closure operator on (A, ρ), the fuzzy set Φc defined as Φc (a) = ρ(c(a), a) is a fuzzy closure system. 2.  If Φ is a fuzzy closure system, the mapping cΦ : A → A defined as cΦ (a) = (aρ ⊗ Φ) is a closure operator on (A, ρ). 3. If c : A → A is a closure operator on (A, ρ), then cΦc = c. 4. If Φ is a fuzzy closure system on (A, ρ), then Φ = ΦcΦ . Analogously, the same discussion can be done by extending closure operators to fuzzy closure relations, which are isotone, idempotent and inﬂationary fuzzy relations κ : A×A → L. A fuzzy closure relation that is minimal among the extensional fuzzy closure relations is named strong fuzzy closure relations. These were introduced in [12]. Therein, it was proved the one-to-one correspondence between strong fuzzy closure relations and fuzzy closure systems [12, Theorem 23]. Fuzzy Galois connections are a main concept in this paper as well. Let us recall the deﬁnition. Definition 9. ([18]). Let (A, ρA ) and (B, ρB ) be fuzzy posets, f : A → B and g : B → A be two mappings. – The pair (f, g) is called an isotone fuzzy Galois connection or fuzzy isotone Galois connection between (A, ρA ) and (B, ρB ), denoted by (f, g) :  (B, ρB ), if (A, ρA )  ρA (g(b), a) = ρB (b, f (a))  
  for all a ∈ A and b ∈ B.  
  Crisp Closure Systems  
  Notice that closure systems as crisp sets are not considered in the Galois connections mentioned above. Thus, a natural step is to study a similar problem with the partially ordered set (2A , ⊆). This addition to the problem is not straightforward since (2A , ⊆) is a crisp poset, whereas (LA , S) and (Isot(AA ), ρ) are complete fuzzy lattices and (IsotTot(LA×A ), ρˆ) is a fuzzy preposet [13]. Thus, we will consider the 1-cut of the fuzzy relations deﬁned above and study the crisp problem. It is well-known that S 1 is Zadeh’s inclusion, hence throughout the paper we will follow the classical notation for subsethood ⊆. We will also consider the 1-cut of ρ, we will denote ρ 1 (f, g) = 1 as f g, and ρˆ1 (κ1 , κ2 ) = 1 will be denoted by κ1  κ2 , that is, f g if and only if ρ(f (a), g(a)) = 1, for all a ∈ A.

  We consider now restrictions to ensure the commutativity of, at least, the ˆ(Φ) is not a closure operator in upper part of the diagram. Let Φ ∈ LA , then c general. However,  c(Φ1 ) will be a closure operator due to Theorem 4. Thus, as expected, the diagram is not commutative in general.

  Conclusions and Further Work  
  This paper continues the line of work which initiated in [13], where the mappings that relate fuzzy closure structures are studied from the point of view of fuzzy Galois connections, together with the commutativity of the corresponding diagrams. In [15], the crisp powerset lattice was introduced in that same framework.

  Pre-scalings  
  Some data tables come with slightly richer information, for which we introduce an additional deﬁnition. A pre-scaling of a many-valued context D := (G, M, W, I) is a family (W (m) | m ∈ M ) of sets W (m) ⊆ W such that W = m∈M W (m) and (g, m, w) ∈ I =⇒ w ∈ W (m) for all g ∈ G, m ∈ M . We call W (m) the value domain of the many-valued attribute m. A tuple (vm | m ∈ M ) matches a pre-scaling iﬀ vm ∈ W (m) ∪ {⊥} holds for all m ∈ M . (G, M, W (m)m∈M , J) may be called a stratified manyvalued context. It is also allowed that the value domains additionally carry a structure, e.g., are ordered. This also falls under the deﬁnition of “pre-scaling”. We remain a little vague here, because its seems premature to give a sharp deﬁnition. Prediger [13] suggests the notion of a relational many-valued context. This may be formalized as a tuple (G, M, (W (m), Rm )m∈M , I), where (G, M, W (m)m∈M , I) is a stratiﬁed many valued-context as deﬁned above, where on each value domain W (m) a family Rm of relations is given. Prediger and Stumme [12] then discuss deriving one-valued attributes using expressions in a suitable logical language, such as one of the OWL-variants. They call this logical scaling.  
  Scaling Dimension  
  A scale for an attribute m of a many-valued context (G, M, W (m)m∈M , I) is a formal context Sm := (Gm , Mm , Im ) with W (m) ⊆ Gm . The objects of a scale are the scale values, the attributes are called scale attributes. By specifying a scale a data analyst determines how the attribute values are used conceptually. For plain scaling a formal context (G, N, J) is derived from the manyvalued context (G, M, W (m)m∈M , I) and the scale contexts Sm , m ∈ M , as follows: – The object set is G, the same as for the many-valued context, – the attribute set is the disjoint union of the scale attribute sets, formally  {m} × Mm , N := m∈M  
  – and the incidence is given by g J (m, n) :⇐⇒ (g, m, v) ∈ I and v Im n. The above deﬁnition may look technical, but what is described is rather simple: Every column of the data table is replaced by several columns, one for each scale attribute of Sm , and if the cell for object g and many-valued attribute m contains the value v, then that is replaced by the corresponding “row” of the scale. Choosing the scales is already an act of interpretation, deriving the formal context when scales are given is deterministic. Pre-scaling, as mentioned above, may suggest the scales to use. An ordered pre-scaling naturally leads to an interordinal interpretation of data, using only interordinal scales. We repeat the standard deﬁnition of interordinal scaling: Definition 1 (Interordinal Scaling of D). When D := (G, M, W, I) is a many-valued context with linearly ordered value sets (W (m), ≤m ), then the formal context I(D) derived from interordinal scaling has G as its object set and attributes of the form (m, ≤m , v) or (m, ≥m , v), where v is a value of the many valued attribute m. The incidence is the obvious one, an object g has e.g., the attribute (m, ≤m , v) iﬀ the value of m for the object g is ≤m v. Instead of (m, ≤m , v) or (m, ≥m , v) one writes m : ≤ v and m : ≥ v, respectively. Formally I(D) := (G, N, J), where N := {m : ≤ v | m ∈ M, v ∈ W (m)} ∪ {m : ≥ v | m ∈ M, v ∈ W (m)} and (g, m : ≤ v) ∈ J :⇐⇒ m(g) ≤ v,  
  (g, m : ≥ v) ∈ J :⇐⇒ m(g) ≥ v.

  Its Ferrers dimension is two, but there are three pairwise incomparable irreducible attributes, which forces its ordinal scaling dimension to be three. A more challenging problem is to determine the interordinal scaling dimension of a context K. We investigate this with the help of the following deﬁnition. Definition 5. An extent ladder of K is a set R ⊆ Ext(K) of nonempty extents that satisﬁes: i) the ordered set (R, ⊆) has width ≤ 2, i.e., R does not contain three mutually incomparable extents, and ii) R is closed under complementation, i.e., when A ∈ R, then also G \ A ∈ R. Note that a ﬁnite (and nonempty) extent ladder is the disjoint union of two chains of equal cardinality, for the following reason: Consider a minimal extent E in the ladder. Any other extent must either contain E or be contained in the complement of E, because otherwise there would be three incomparable extents. The extents containing E must form a chain, and so do their complements, which are all contained in the complement of E. Theorem 2 (Interordinal Scaling Dimension). The interordinal scaling dimension of a ﬁnite formal context K, if it exists, is equal to the smallest number of extent ladders, the union of which contains all meet-irreducible extents of K. Proof. Let K be a formal context with interordinal scaling dimension d. W.l.o.g. we may assume that K was derived by plain interordinal scaling from a manyvalued context D with d many-valued attributes. We have to show that the  
  Discussion and Future Work  
  The presented results on the scaling dimension have a number of interfaces and correspondences to classical data science methods. A natural link to investigate would be comparing the scaling dimension with standard correlation measures. Two features that correlate prefectly, e.g., Fig. 1, induce an equivalent conceptual scaling on the data. An analog of the scaling dimension in this setting would be the smallest number of independent features. Or, less strict, the smallest number of features such that these features do not correlate more than some parameter. This obvious similarity of both methods is breached by a key advantage of our approach. In contrast to correlation measures, our method relies solely on ordinal properties [14] and does not require the introduction of measurements for distance or ratios. Proposition 4 has already shown that there is a relationship between an aspect of the scaling dimension of a formal context and the order dimension of its concept lattice. The assumption that further such relationships may exist is therefore reasonable. Yet, a thorough investigation of these relationships is an extensive research program in its own right and therefore cannot be addressed within the scope of this paper. An investigation on how the scaling dimension relates to other measures of dimension within the realm of FCA [9,15] is therefore deemed future work. Due to novel insights into the computational tractability of recognizing scalemeasures [7] (that is in preparation and will be made public later this year) we have little hope that the scaling dimension and interordinal scaling dimension can be decided in polynomial time. Despite that, eﬃcient algorithms for real-world data that compute the scaling dimension and its speciﬁc versions, i.e., ordinal, interordinal, nominal, etc., may be developed. In addition to that, so far it is unknown if an approximation of the scaling dimension, e.g., with respect to some degree of conceptual scaling error [8] or bounds, is tractable. If computationally feasible, such an approximation could allow larger data sets to be handled. Another line of research that can be pursued in future work is how the scaling dimension can be utilized to derive more readable line diagrams. We can envision that diagrams of concept lattices that are composed of fewer scales, i.e., have a lower scaling dimension, are more readable even if they have slightly more concepts. An open problem that needs to be solved here is: for a context K and k ∈ N identify k scales that cover the largest number of concepts from B(K) with respect to scale measures.

  Abstract. Implications in Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), Horn clauses in Logic, and Functional Dependencies (FDs) in the Relational Database Model, are very important dependency types in their respective ﬁelds. Moreover, they have been proved to be equivalent from a syntactical point of view. Then notions and algorithms related to one dependency type in a ﬁeld can be reused and applied to another dependency type in the other ﬁeld. One of these notions is that of cover, also known as a basis, i.e., a compact representation of a complete set of implications, FDs, or Horn clauses. Although the notion of cover exists in the three ﬁelds, the characterization and the related uses of a cover are diﬀerent. In this paper, we study and compare, from an FCA perspective, the principles on which rely the most important covers in each ﬁeld. Finally, we discuss some open questions that are of interest in the three ﬁelds, and especially to the FCA community.  
  Keywords: Functional dependencies Dependency Covers · Closure  
  iterative application of the Armstrong axioms is of importance in RDBM, logic, and FCA. We start by quoting the survey [13] which comes from the Relational Database ﬁeld: Most of the papers in dependency theory deal exclusively with various aspects of the implication problem, that is, the problem of deciding for a given set of dependencies Σ and a dependency σ whether Σ logically implies σ. The reason for the prominence of this problem is that an algorithm for testing implication of dependencies enables us to test whether two given sets of dependencies are equivalent or whether a given set of dependencies is redundant. A solution for the last two problems seems a signiﬁcant step towards automated database schema design, which some researchers see as the ultimate goal for research in dependency theory. In what way are those two problems a signiﬁcant step towards automated database schema design and what is the reason of the prominence of the implication problem? Functional dependencies are used to design relational schemes (see for example the extensive Chap. 12.2 Nonloss decomposition and functional dependencies in [10]). However, some of the FDs that are used to describe the data base may be redundant in the sense that they are derivable from the others. These (redundant) FDs used to assist this method of schema design will induce redundancy in the relational schema, which is to be avoided since redundancy in relations creates serious problems in maintaining a consistent data base. Hence, one needs to be able to compute a covering (here we will use the term cover ) of a set of dependencies, this is, a non-redundant set of FDs that yields the same closure with respect to the axioms for FDs. And, the problem of ﬁnding a covering reduces to computing the predicate σ ∈ Σ + , that is, Σ |= σ (all portions of text in italic are citations from [6]). Summing up, the implication problem for FDs is of importance because it solves the problem of computing a cover of a set of FDs which, in turn, prevents the propagation of redundancy in the design of a database scheme using functional dependencies. In FCA, the basic data structure is the binary context which can have two related representations, namely the concept lattice and the basis of implications. The latter is the Duquenne-Guigues basis which is unique, minimal, and non redundant (see 5). There is an equivalence between these three views of an initial dataset. Moreover, one can be also interested in the so-called equivalence classes which are associated with one closed set and possibly several generators of diﬀerent types [21]. A typical implication is related to any equivalence class which is of the form X → Y where Y is a closed set and closure(X) = Y . Then, a minimal basis has all its importance since it provides a summary of the dataset under study with a minimum number of elements. In particular, the number of implications in say the Duquenne-Guigues basis is much smaller than the number of concepts, that is, a substantial number of implications can be inferred from this minimum basis. This is also of importance when the problem of construction or reconstruction is considered, that is, starting with a set of  
  Definitions  
  In this section we introduce the deﬁnitions used in this paper. We do not provide the references for all of them because they can be found in all the textbooks and papers related to the RDBM, Logic and FCA. As explained in the introduction, implications [15], functional dependencies [20] and Horn clauses [16] are dependencies between sets of attributes, which are equivalent from a syntactical point of view, since they are in agreement with the Armstrong axioms. Definition 1. Given set of attributes U, for any X, Y, Z ⊆ U, the Armstrong axioms are: 1. Reflexivity: If Y ⊆ X, then X → Y holds. 2. Augmentation. If X → Y holds, then XZ → Y Z holds. 3. Transitivity. If X → Y and Y → Z hold, then X → Z holds. When we write that a dependency X → Y holds, we mean all the instances in which this dependency is valid or true. Therefore, the sentence “If X → Y holds, then XZ → Y Z holds” can be rephrased as “In any instance in which X → Y is valid, the dependency XZ → Y Z is valid as well”. The Armstrong axioms allow us to deﬁne the closure of a set of dependencies as the iterative application of these axioms over a set of dependencies. Definition 2. Σ + denotes the closure of a set of dependencies Σ, and can be constructed thanks to the iterative application of the Armstrong axioms over Σ. This iterative application terminates when no new dependency can be added, and it is ﬁnite. Therefore, Σ + contains the largest set of dependencies that hold in all instances in which all the dependencies in Σ hold. The closure of a set of dependencies induces the deﬁnition of the cover of such a set of dependencies. Definition 3. The cover or basis of a set of dependencies Σ is any set Σ  such that Σ + = Σ + . We deﬁne now the concept of a closure of a set of attributes X ⊆ U with respect to a set of implications Σ. Definition 4. The closure of X with respect to a set of dependencies Σ is closureΣ (X) = { Y | X → Y ∈ Σ + } that is, closureΣ (X) is the largest set of attributes Y such that X → Y can be derived by the iterative application of the Armstrong axioms over the set Σ. This closure operation returns the largest set of attributes such that Σ |= X → closureΣ (X). Therefore, the implication problem Σ |= X → Y boils down to testing whether Y ⊆ closureΣ (X).  
  Three Views on Dependency Covers from an FCA Perspective  
  // Outer loop // Inner loop  
  In Table 1 we list diﬀerent complexities of Closure as they are given in a classic database textbook [20], a FCA textbook [14] and the pioneer paper of Linclosure [4]1 . In general terms, the complexity of Closure depends on its two loops which are marked in the code as outer and inner loops. This algorithm iterates in the outer loop as long as there is a change in the computation of closureΣ (X). This means that in the worst case, the closure may be incremented by only one single attribute at each iteration of the outer loop, which implies that the outer loop is of order O(|U|). Regarding the inner loop, it necessarily iterates over all the dependencies that are in Σ, that is, it is of order O(|Σ|). Then the total number of iterations, in the worst case, is of order O(|U| × |Σ|). Since in some cases it may happen that |Σ| = |U|, the complexity of this algorithm can be, in the worst case, of order O(|Σ|2 ). 1  
  Other relevant textbooks on RDBM line [1, 27] provide the same complexity analysis as in Table 1.  
  J. Baixeries et al.  
  However, there are two extra comments about this complexity analysis. First, we have stated that the inner loop (line 4) iterates over all the dependencies in Σ, but all the dependencies that have been used to compute closureΣ (X) are deleted in line 8. But even if this removal is performed, the number of iterations is still of order |Σ|, since in the worst case, we may remove only one single dependency from Σ at each iteration of the inner loop. Also, in line 5, there is a subset containment check of order O(|U|) that is performed as many times as there are iterations of the inner loop. This fact, which is only considered in [20], induces a complexity of order O(|U| × |Σ|2 ). As we can observe in Table 1, the consensus is that the complexity of Closure is of order O(|Σ|2 ) (in the worst case scenario |U| = |Σ|). However, in cases when |U| 2 or m > 2. c1 c2 c3 c1 c2 c3 c1 c2 c3 a1 × × × × × × × × × a2 × × × a3 × × × × × × o1 o2 o3

  for all x1 , . . . , xn ∈ A, which precisely expresses that s is an endomorphism of the algebra A; f . Therefore, for F ⊆ OA the functions s ∈ F ∗(1) are exactly the endomorphisms of the algebra A; F , i.e., F ∗(1) = End A; F . In other words, this means that for ﬁxed A the (dually ordered) intent lattice of K1 is precisely the lattice of all possible endomorphism monoids of any possible algebraic structure on A, ordered by set inclusion. By inspecting the lattice, one may locate endomorphism monoids that are so-called ‘cores’, which is relevant for determining the complexity of solving systems of equations over algebras. This article is concerned with the task of computationally enumerating all centralising monoids on a three-element set A, of giving witnesses for them in an automated fashion and of counting them. Rephrased in terms of algebraic structures, this means determining the elements and cardinality of the lattice of 1  
  For brevity we shall forego restricting the general commutation relation by intersection with OA ∩AA even though this would be required to be meticulously correct.

  Proof. Let s ∈ OA and an identiﬁcation closed set F ⊆ OA be ∗ given, and assume that F  {s} . This means there exists some opera∗ tion f ∈ F \ {s} ; let us choose such a function f of minimum possible Proposition 8(ii) we have ns,F ≤ k, wherefore arity ns,F  ∈ N+ . From ∗ Is := ns,G | G  {s} closed w.r.t. proper variable identiﬁcations is a nonempty subset of {1, . . . , k}, and hence ns := max Is satisﬁes 1 ≤ ns ≤ k. As ∗ ∗ ns,F ∈ Is , we infer ns,F ≤ ns ≤ k. Thus, f ∈ F (ns,F ) \ {s} ⊆ F (≤ns ) \ {s} , ∗ and therefore F (≤ns )  {s} . If we assume F to be closed under minors in general, then we can use the ﬁctitious minor g := δα f ∈ F , where α : ns,F → ns ∗ ∗ is the identical embedding, to prove that g ∈ F (ns ) \ {s} , i.e., F (ns )  {s} . Namely, by using the identiﬁcation map β : ns → ns,F given as β() :=  for indices 0 ≤  < ns,F and β() := ns,F − 1 else, we have β(α()) = β() =  for 0 ≤  < ns,F , and thus β ◦ α = idns,F . By functoriality of taking minors, ∗ / {s} , which by Corolwe conclude δβ g = δβ (δα f ) = δβ◦α f = δidns,F f = f ∈ ∗ ∗ lary 4 implies that indeed g ∈ / {s} , for otherwise the centraliser {s} would have   to contain the minor δβ g = f . As an immediate consequence we may uniformly take ns = |A| for every (1) s ∈ OA to satisfy the implication of Lemma 9 on a ﬁnite set A. (1)  
  Corollary 10. For any ﬁnite set A of size |A| = k, each s ∈ OA and every ∗ F ⊆ OA satisfying F  {s} and being closed under proper variable identiﬁca∗ tions, we have F (≤k)  {s} . (1)  
  Proof. Given s ∈ OA , take ns ≤ k constructed in Lemma 9. Then any function ∗ set F  {s} that is closed under proper variable identiﬁcations fulﬁls, again by ∗ ∗   Lemma 9, ∅ = F (≤ns ) \ {s} ⊆ F (≤k) \ {s} , as required. (1)  
  For any ﬁnite set A of size |A| = k and every s ∈ OA , Lemma 9 guarantees ∗ the existence of a smallest arity ns ∈ {1, . . . , k} such that every F  {s} ∗ (≤ns ) that is closed under variable identiﬁcations satisﬁes F  {s} . We shall mainly exploit this implication for very speciﬁc types of clones, in fact, speciﬁc (1) centraliser clones, and it may well be that for some s ∈ OA there exists a smaller arity ns which satisﬁes the implications claimed by Lemma 9 under this restriction. We shall not explore ﬁnding the smallest possible value of ns in detail, except for simple but important cases. ∗  
  Lemma 11. If s = idA or s = ca for some a ∈ A, then F  {s} implies ∗ F (1)  {s} for all F ⊆ OA that are closed under proper variable identiﬁcations. ∗  
  Lemma 13. Given any s ∈ OA and n ∈ N+ we have the equivalent description    (n)  ∗ Φs,n = f ∈ OA  ∀0 ≤ i < j < n : Δij f ∈ {s}    (n)  ∗ = f ∈ OA  ∀0 ≤ m < n ∀α : n → m : δα f ∈ {s} . ∗  
  Proof. If f ∈ Φs,n and 0 ≤ i < j < n, then clearly Δij f = δαij ∈ {s} because αij : n  n − 1 is surjective and non-injective due to i < j. For the second (n) ∗ inclusion assume that f ∈ OA satisﬁes Δij f ∈ {s} for all 0 ≤ i < j < n and consider any m < n and any α : n → m. As m < n, the map α cannot be injective, hence there are 0 ≤ i < j < n for which α(i) = α(j). By our assumption ∗ we have Δij f ∈ {s} . We deﬁne β : n − 1 → m by β() := α() if 0 ≤  < j and β() := α( + 1) if j ≤  ≤ n − 2. Hence, β(αij ()) = β() = α() if 0 ≤  < j, β(αij (j)) = β(i) = α(i) = α(j), and β(αij ()) = β( − 1) = α( − 1 + 1) = α() for all j <  < n. Thus, we have β ◦ αij = α, and, by functoriality of taking ∗ minors, we infer δβ ◦ δαij = δβ◦αij = δα , that is, δα f = δβ (Δij f ) ∈ {s} because ∗ ∗ Δij f ∈ {s} and the centraliser {s} is closed under minors by Corollary 4. The  remaining containment relation in Φs,n obviously follows by specialisation.  We now provide the theoretical backbone for constructing smaller witnesscomplete sets. The result is obtained by reﬁning the proof techniques used in [17, Theorem 2.5] and [22, Theorem 3.1]. Theorem 14. Let A be a ﬁnite set of size |A| = k, and let (ns )s∈O(1) \{idA } (1)

Since every maximal independent set S is in one-to-one correspondence with (S, S), the formal concept of Kc (Qn ), mis(Qn ) = |M+ (Qn )|, where M+ (Qn ) = {(S, S) | (S, S) ∈ B(Kc (Qn ))}. 2 . Let us also denote Let us denote mis(Qn ) as M+ , then |Kc (Qn )| = M+ by M− all the remaining concepts with equally sized extent and intent, not contained in M+ (Qn ). 2 = M+ + M− + 2l, where 2l counts all the concepts with unequal Hence, M+ sizes of extent and intent (it is even due to the existence of concept (B, A) for each (A, B) with |A| = |B|). Since, (M+ − 1)M+ is even, M− is even.

  Conclusions  
  We hope the obtained results both can stimulate the interest of FCA practitioners in the problems of combinatorial enumeration in Graph Theory and attract mathematicians with the discovered facts and posed conjectures obtained with the help of concept lattices. The subsequent study of the problem includes further development and performance optimisation of the available FCA-based inventory in connection with tools from Linear Algebra and Generating Functions suitable for larger n, as well as theoretical proofs and reﬁnements of the posed conjectures and investigation of both the structural properties and analytical (asymptotic) behaviour of the maximal independence polynomials.

  and implementation constraints, but has speciﬁc qualities for knowledge discovery. E.g. Graph-FCA provides concepts highlighting graph patterns shared by tuples, while RCA provides interconnected concept lattices, one per object category. This paper focuses on RCA. RCA is based on a simple input data model composed of objects described by Boolean attributes and unidirectional binary relationships between these objects. Practical application raised the issue of encoding a dataset into this formalism, which was more or less easy according to the dataset model structure, such as converting a ternary relation into binary relations [21]. Similar problems arise for encoding object descriptions with particular attribute values (e.g. numerical) into a formal context made of Boolean ones. The latter can be addressed, for example, using scaling approaches [15] or Pattern Structures [14]. To facilitate access of new users to RCA, capitalizing the experience gained in applying RCA in various existing applications is a need. This paper aims to describe a general approach, to pave the way for the deﬁnition of design patterns for RCA application. To this end, we present what such design patterns might look like, and give a few illustrations. Section 2 presents basics of RCA, some typical applications, and our motivation for capitalizing the encoding practices as design patterns. Section 3 outlines the design pattern notion, inspired by its deﬁnition in the ﬁeld of software engineering, and illustrates it through two examples. Section 4 discusses opportunities for developing the approach. We conclude and give a few perspectives of this work in Sect. 5.

  e.g. concept C_Crop_15 that groups wheat and barley for the common attribute cereal (right-hand side lattice of Fig. 1). At the next step, the relational context attacks is used to form relational attributes that express a relation that a pest object may have with a crop concept, such as ∃attacks(C_Crop_15) assigned to Contarinia triciti and Oulema melanopa because they attack at least one crop of C_Crop_15. This causes the creation of concept C_Pest_18, which would not be there without ∃attacks(C_Crop_15) (left-hand side lattice of Fig. 1). The relational attributes can be formed with diﬀerent quantiﬁers (e.g. ∃∀, ⊇, or with percentages). The number of iterations depends on the data model. The same process can be applied to more complex datasets, eventually containing circuits.

  architect Christophe Alexander [3]. Gamma et al. oﬀers a catalog of DPs for object-oriented designers to transfer knowledge, in particular from experts to beginners, to help them achieve a good design by choosing among several proven alternatives. In the catalog, four essential parts are highlighted to describe a DP: the pattern name, the problem, the solution, and the consequences. The pattern name is important as it becomes part of a shared vocabulary. Describing the problem involves deﬁning the context and the favorable conditions of the DP application. The solution describes the diﬀerent elements that take part to the design in an abstract and conﬁgurable way. The consequences include predictable eﬀects of the pattern application and compromises that may have to be done between diﬀerent qualities of the results. In addition, each DP is described in the catalog using more than ten sections. While some sections are speciﬁc to objectoriented design (e.g. classes/objects participants, or sample code), others can be adopted for other domains. In this paper, to remain synthetic, the following ﬁve description sections are used: – Problem. The problem is expressed in terms of dataset content and analysis objective. As in [13], this is the most tricky part of the description. – Solution. For RCA, the solution consists in expressing how to formally design and populate a Relational Context Family from the problem description. – Example. This section presents a short example of the pattern application. – Known uses. This section reports existing case studies of the literature where the DP has been applied. – Consequences. This section reviews alternatives and discusses the consequences of the application of the DP relatively to the analysis objective, in particular in terms of usability/readability of the result. 3.2  
  The Design Pattern Separate/Gather Views

  Known Uses. This DP has been implemented for the analysis of visual accessibility options in operating systems (OS) in [23]. This analysis had diﬀerent purposes, including making recommendations to OS developers to design a new version, to assist end-users ﬁnding an accessibility conﬁguration close to the current conﬁguration when the OS upgrades, or when end-users have to change OS. In this study, the objects are operating systems (OS) and the views cover three visual accessibility options categories (contrast, text, zoom). Separating the views allows to analyze the OS along a single problematic, e.g. to observe commonly shared contrast options, which OS provides more contrast options than another, or which options are never provided together. Gathering the views classiﬁes the OS in a global way, e.g. helping identifying which ones are equivalent on all option categories, how they diﬀer from each other, and how the options of the diﬀerent categories interact. Moreover, an application has been developed by [18] using this DP to assist Feature location (FL) in Software Product Line Engineering. Consequences. Part of the value of this pattern relies on the relevance of the designed views. It may be more or less complex to determine which set of attributes corresponds to a view, as a single semantics should be associated with this view, e.g. habitat versus food for animals. Note that partitioning attributes participating to diﬀerent coherent sets is not relevant, e.g. for animals, the Boolean attribute aquatic environment can be an attribute in views natural habitat and growing conditions. An additional interest of using this RCA DP may occur when considering the pattern variation in which an object can have several views, corresponding for instance to diﬀerent versions. Diﬀerent quantiﬁers can thus be used in the diverse relations, e.g. in the Sushis example,  
  Perspectives  
  Section 3 presented two DPs, that were used in concrete applications, focusing on various aspects of relational data, as can be considered in the RCA framework. Several perspectives are oﬀered by this work. Two of them are discussed in this section, i.e. identifying additional DPs that can be useful to help RCA users and revisiting existing applications. New Opportunities for Defining DPs. Additional DPs were identiﬁed along the existing applications. A few examples are introduced hereafter. Some data models included a specialization/generalization (is-a) relationship. Analyzing the associated dataset required to ﬂatten the hierarchical descriptions [10,16,19], to discover abstractions previously hidden. This new DP could be named Collapse Specialization. The DP Reify Relation may consist in introducing a formal context in the RCF for describing the tuples of a relation. This approach was used by [21] to derive a binary representation of an N-ary relation, without loosing information. The link reiﬁcation, as realized in [9] and [4], could be considered through the same perspective. The DP, dual to Separate/Gather Views, is Separate/Gather Objects, in which objects of a same category can be separated into several subsets to analyze each subset apart or all subsets as a whole. This approach was considered by [16] to normalize a UML class model to detect candidate attribute generalizations on diverse criteria, e.g. name, substring in the name, synonyms, type, default value. The DP Instances2Model  
  RCA in Practice  
  may address objects with multi-valued attributes to extract a schema, as it has been done from instance descriptions in [9]. It consists in simplifying the description considering that an object has a value for an attribute (but not the value). Introducing virtual objects representing a Query has been proposed by authors in the context of FCA. This can be extended to the context of RCA, such as in [6], introducing several virtual objects in formal contexts and virtual links in relational contexts. This approach has been adopted for solving the problem of replacing a failing web service in a web service workﬂow [5]. Finally, sequences can be modeled into RCA input with a transitive relation ’precedes’ or ’succeeds’, according to the DP Temporal [28]. Other transitive relations (e.g. part-of/includes, or down/upstream-of [27]) may also correspond to this DP. Revisiting Applications with the DPs. The DP Separate/Gather Views presented in Sect. 3 could be applied to revisit and improve a previous work on component catalog FCA-based building [1], in which software components were described with provided/required interfaces, each interface containing a set of services. In this catalog, the description was made using a single formal context. The catalog then organized the software components with this description and exposed possible substitution between components from the two viewpoints as a whole (provided as well as required services). This hardly helps the lattice exploration considering only one viewpoint, e.g. a user may want to search a component with provided services, and consider in a second step the required services, that other components could provide. Another potential use of the DP Separate/Gather Views could be to consider positive versus negative description of objects, a question that has been addressed in [30], to complete their approach using an additional point of view.

  Abstract. The Hasse diagrams of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) concept lattices have the disadvantages that users need to be trained in reading the diagrams and diagrams of larger lattices tend to be too cluttered to be comprehensible. This paper therefore discusses how to reduce lattices and then represent them with a specific type of Euler diagram instead of Hasse diagrams. A semi-automated process of reducing concept lattices is described and supported by algorithms.

  The diagrams should not be named after Hasse because he did not invent them, but the name is widely established in the literature. An introduction to FCA is not included in this paper. Standard FCA terminology is used: intension, extension, a cross table for the formal context, and so on. An object concept is the lowest concept which has the object in its extension. Attribute concepts are defined dually. Based on the author’s personal teaching experience with introductory mathematics courses. Again based on the author’s teaching experience. “Small” in this paper means < 20 concepts.  
  3 Reducing Concept Lattices This section provides a brief summary of methods for reducing concept lattices by offloading information from diagrams and instead storing it as logical expressions. The resulting RD-Euler diagrams then focus on information that is easier to represent graphically whereas the expressions focus on information that is more suited to textual representation. As mentioned in the introduction, the topic of reducing lattices has been discussed in the literature but usually with a focus on special properties or using fuzzy/probabilistic methods. The methods discussed in this section are more general, simple and mostly well-known. But the practical, joint use of diagrams and textual information has not yet received much attention. The assumptions about the data of a given formal context for this paper are: crisp, non-fuzzy data: probability or other approximations are not relevant for this paper. background knowledge may be available providing further relations, groupings, domains and so on for the objects and attributes. three valued logic applies to most formal contexts because a missing cross can either mean that an attribute does not apply or that it is unknown whether it applies.  
  lists O, A, C of objects, attributes, concepts list L of logical statements (e.g. implications) lists OC and AC for the object/attribute concepts 2-dimensional Boolean array J of size |O| × |A| for the formal context 2-dimensional Boolean array N of size |C| × |C| containing the immediate upper neighbours for each concept (i.e. the edges of the Hasse diagram) The following should be computed:  
  • 2-dimensional array P of size |A| × |A| computed by pairwise comparison of the column bitvectors of the attributes. Contains: “e” if the two attributes are equal, “s” for “smaller not equal” (i.e. for every 1 of the first there must be a 1 in the second), “g” for “greater not equal”, “n” for negation and “0” otherwise. • procedure delete(a) removes an attribute a from A and J and recomputes everything else as required • procedure neigh(c) returns the set of upper neighbours of concept c according to N • procedure meet(a) returns a (shortest) list of attributes with binary intersection a or NONE. • procedure join(a) returns a (shortest) list of attributes with binary union a or NONE. The algorithm SynAndOrNot computes attributes that are reducible with Synonym-, AND-, OR- or NOT-reduction. The algorithm Negate computes NEGATION-reduction. Horizontal splits are computed with the final algorithm. For a lower horizontal split, the algorithm HorizontalSplit is used but is stopped as soon as the immediate upper neighbours of all object concepts have been processed. Then the top concepts are removed from each partition and it is checked whether the partitions remain unchanged if all lower neighbours (apart from the bottom concept) are added to each partition. An Algorithm for Conceptual Partitioning is not provided in detail. Several different steps and strategies can be used to determine which concept extensions are most suitable for partitioning the objects: • determine which concepts are supplemental and whether objects should be added to non-supplemental concepts • check whether any other reduction methods are applicable • run a LOWER HORIZONTAL SPLIT algorithm and determine whether each set of objects corresponds to a concept extension • any negatable attribute always partitions the set of objects, therefore identify negatable attributes that partition the set of objects approximately in half (can involve single attributes, but also 2 or 3 attributes) • in order to compare all different possibilities of partitioning, determine which one reduces the number of supplemental concepts • show different versions to users and ask them which they prefer

 About  
 ICFEC 2023  
 The 7th IEEE International Conference on Fog and Edge Computing (ICFEC 2023) is a leading forum to disseminate and discuss research activities and results on a broad range of topics in the fields of fog and edge computing. ICFEC 2023 will take place in conjunction with The 23rd International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing (CCGrid 2023).  
  Fog and edge computing have received much attention by both the research community and the industry in recent years, and are today seen as an alternative to the utilization of cloud-based computational resources. Especially, this is the case in scenarios where large amounts of data are produced in distributed settings, e.g., in the Internet of Things (IoT), where data needs to be processed in (near) real time, or where suboptimal network connectivity hampers the upload of very large amounts of data to the cloud. Use cases for fog and edge computing range from smart factories over smart grids to autonomous vehicles, to name just some examples.

  Scope:A new and disruptive paradigm spear-headed by academics and industry experts is taking shape so that applications can leverage resources located at the edge of the network and along the continuum between the cloud and the edge. The Fog/Edge computing paradigm is expected to improve the agility of service deployments, make use of opportunistic and cheap computing, and leverage the network latency and bandwidth diversities between these resources. Numerous challenges arise when using edge resources, which requires the re-examination of operating systems, virtualization and containers, and middleware techniques for fabric management. The conference seeks to attract high-quality contributions covering both theory and practice over system software and domain-specific applications related to next-generation distributed systems that use the edge.

 Title:  Separation of Concerns for Complexity Mitigation in System and Domain Formal Modelling – A Dive into Algebraic Event-B Theories  
 Abstract:   
 Formal methods have shown their ability and efficiency in the design, analysis and verification of safety critical complex software systems. A crucial challenge for formal methods nowadays is to make them reasonably accessible, as to foster a wider adoption across system engineering, and make their implementation and deployment more operational for non-expert engineers and researchers alike. From our point of view, promoting the reuse and sharing of explicitly formalised elements such as models, theories, proofs, etc. contributes, undoubtedly, to the dissemination of these methods. As a result, reuse mechanisms must be defined and integrated into development processes such as refinement, abstraction, composition/decomposition, etc.  
 In this talk, we will discuss state -based formal methods, namely the Event-B method. We report on our findings about the definition of algebraic theories that are utilised within Event-B model refinement chains. In our method, Event-B models borrow operators, axioms, theorems, proof and rewrite rules from these theories. Relying on their well-definedness, these operators, axioms, theorems and proof and rewrite rules are useful to discharge the proof obligations generated for these models, and contribute to reducing development efforts, as theorems of the theories are proved once and for all. The approach is illustrated on the generation of new proof obligations and on system models conformance to engineering standards.

 Journal-First Presentations  
 ICFEM 2023 is inviting journal-first presentations of papers published recently in the following journals:  
 ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems 
  Theoretical Computer Science 
 The presentations will offer the authors an opportunity to speak directly to their peers in the community, and also enrich the ICFEM program. The journal-first presentation will be listed in the conference program, yet the corresponding papers will not be part of the ICFEM proceedings as they have been published through the journals. At least one author of each accepted journal-first presentation must register for and attend the ICFEM conference to present the paper.  
  Evaluation and Selection  
 A journal-first presentation submitted to ICFEM must adhere to the following criteria:  
 The journal paper is in the scope of ICFEM 2023. 
  The paper was accepted by one of the participating journals no earlier than January 1, 2022. 
  The paper reports completely new research results or presents novel contributions that were not previously reported in prior work. 
  The paper does not extend prior work solely with additional proofs or algorithms, additional empirical results, or minor enhancements or variants of the results presented in the prior work. 
  The paper has not been presented at, and is not under consideration for, journal-first programs of other conferences. 
 Each submission will be evaluated according to these criteria. In case that the number of submissions is higher than expected, eligible submissions may be selected to be presented at the conference, and priority will be given to the papers that best fit the conference program.  
  How to Submit  
 Interested authors should submit a short presentation proposal consisting of the paper title, abstract, a short statement on how the work satisfies the above criteria, and the PDF of the original journal paper. Please submit a single PDF file and list all authors of the original journal paper as authors in EasyChair. No special formatting is required.

 Doctoral Symposium Paper Submission  
 The ICFEM Doctoral Symposium is an international forum for PhD students studying all areas related to formal methods for software, hardware and system development. This forum is an excellent opportunity bringing together PhD students and well-known established researchers from the formal methods community. It will also provide PhD students with fruitful feedback and advice on their research approach and enable them to interact with other PhD students in order to stimulate the exchange of ideas and the sharing of experiences among participants. In summary, the PhD forum will provide PhD students with an ideal opportunity to present, share and discuss their research in a constructive and critical scientific atmosphere.  
 We seek submissions from PhD students who have either determined the direction of their thesis research (probably with some preliminary results already published), but who still have substantial work to complete; or PhD student participants who are in the early stages of their dissertations. It is not required to have a paper accepted at the main conference in order to participate in the ICFEM Doctoral Symposium.  
 Submissions to the Doctoral Symposium should include: Title of the research, the author name (single name) and affiliation; Context and motivation; Problem statement and related work; Proposed solutions and current research efforts, their significance, methodology, results and analysis, and future work. The paper should be prepared using the LNCS format  and submitted in PDF format via EasyChair.  
 Authors with accepted submissions are expected to attend the Doctoral Symposium in person to present their work. A discounted registration fee for Doctoral Symposium participants will be announced later.

"ICFP_1 conference:
International Conference on Functional Programming  
 ICFP (International Conference on Functional Programming)  is an annual programming language conference. It is sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery ( ACM  ) under the aegis of the ACM Special Interest Group on Programming Languages ( SIGPLAN  ), in association with Working Group 2.8 of the International Federation of Information Processing ( IFIP  ). ICFP combined two former biennial conferences: Functional Programming and Computer Architecture (FPCA)  and Lisp and Functional Programming (LFP)  .  
 ICFP  provides a forum for researchers and developers to hear about the latest work on the design, implementations, principles, and uses of functional programming. The conference covers the entire spectrum of work, from practice to theory, including its peripheries.  
 This page is designed to be a permanent home for information about, or relevant to, ICFP. As well as information about the conference itself, it contains pointers to journals, other conferences and workshops, and so on, that may be of interest. Please email suggestions for improvement to Sam Westrick  .  
 Scope  
 ICFP seeks original papers on the art and science of functional programming. Submissions are invited on all topics from principles to practice, from foundations to features, from abstraction to application. The scope includes all languages that encourage functional programming, including both purely applicative and imperative languages, as well as languages with objects or concurrency. Particular topics of interest include:  
 Language Design: | type systems; concurrency and distribution; modules; components and composition; metaprogramming; relations to object-oriented or logic programming; interoperability 
  Implementation: | abstract machines; compilation; compile-time and run-time optimization; memory management; multi-threading; exploiting parallel hardware; interfaces to foreign functions, services components or low-level machine resources 
  Applications and Domain-Specific Languages: | symbolic computing; formal-methods tools; artificial intelligence; systems programming; distributed-systems and web programming; hardware design; databases; XML processing; scientific and numerical computing; graphical user interfaces; multimedia programming; scripting; system administration; security; education 
  Functional Pearls: | elegant, instructive and fun essays on functional programming 
  The conference also solicits Experience Reports  , which are short papers that provide evidence that functional programming really works or describe obstacles that have kept it from working in a particular application.

 Agile  Software  Development  (ASD)  paradigm  has   
 gained  significant attention  due to  its flexible  approach to   
 managing  the  requirement  volatilit  y  and  emphasis  on   
 extensive collaboration  between customers and  developers   
 the  practitione  rs  and re  searchers  to investigate  the  relevant   
 experiences reported  in th  e literature to  learn  how agile   
 practices  can be effecti  vely  used  in  GSD  projects.  Due to   
 the  fact  t  hat  agile  practices  are  b  ased  on  the philosophy of   
 close,  frequent  and  collocated  collaborations,  the   
 presented in  Section  IV.  Section V  discusses  the  findings to   
 draw some conclusions. The limitations of the study are   
 mentioned in Section VI. Section VII closes t  he paper with a   
 brief discussion of the  researchable issues on t  his topic.

 business,  the  market  and  technology.  These  meetings  could   
 also last up to 4 hours. A retrospective  meeting may be   
 scheduled to assess the teamwork in the completed sprin  ts. A   
 daily  Scrum  meeting  b  y  a  Scrum  team  is  a  15-minute  long   
 [4].  For  this  reason  we  have  decided  to  explore,  investigate   
 and  explain  various  challenging  factors  that  restrict  the  use

 steps for  the reported study  as described in  the following   
 sections of this paper.

 C.  Final Selection    
 We  used  the following  screening criteria  to ensure  the   
 papers address our research topic  .   
 1.  Does  a paper  address  the  use of  any  Scrum pract  ices in    
 distributed projects?   
 2.  Does  a paper discuss any real life experience of using    
 Scrum practices in distributed projects  ?   
 As there  is a l  ack of existing  empirical r  esearch, we  also   
 that ad  dress the  use  of  Scrum  practice in  GSD  projects.  For   
 additional quality assessment, we included following two   
 criteria related to the quality of each  paper’s description.   
 3.  Does the objective of the paper is  clearly mentioned?    
 4.  Does  the  pa  per  discuss  GSD  project  contextual   factors    
 adequately?   
 was measured  based on  the GSE  background info  rmation as   
 shown in Appendix B. These  4 points provided a meas  ure of   
 the  ext  ent  to which  we  are  confi  dent  that   a selected  paper   
 could  ma  ke  a  valuable  contribution  to  understand  the   
 current use of Scrum  practices in distribute  d setting. Each of   
 papers  that  discussed  some  other  agile  m  ethods  and   
 practices  (e.g.  XP,  p  air  programming).  Among  t  he  21   
 papers,  we  found  that  one  journal  paper  [S1]  was  an   
 extended  versio  n  of  p  reviously  published conference pa  per   
 [S1a].  We  also  found  th  at  two  papers  [S3]  and  [S3a]   
 comprehensive recently published papers  as mentioned in   
 appendix A.  In  addition,  one researcher went  thro  ugh the   
 reference list o  f every selected pap  er of this final  stage. This   
 helped  us  to  i  dentify  an  y  r  elevant  paper  that  was  not   
 extracted  by  our  search  strategy.  In  this  proces  s,  we   
 identified on  e journal  paper  [S8]  that  was  not  retrieved   
 through  our  search  of  electronic  databases  but  was  cited  by   
 some of  the s  elected papers  [S1,  S4]. Th  e abstract  was   
 reviewed  by  two  resear  chers  independently  and  agreed  t  hat   
 the  paper  [S8]  appeared t  o b  e  within  the  scope  of  the   
 research.  Finall  y we  selected  20  papers  (e  xcluding  two   
 repeated pap  ers S1a  and  S3a  and  including  one  journal   
 paper  S8  from  initially  selected  21  papers)  for  data   
 extraction  and  synthesis  phases.  We  have  enlisted  the   
 selected primary studies in Appendi  x A.   
 D.  Data Extraction and Synthesis    
 From the final selected studies  , we extracted data using a   
 pre-defined  d  ata  extraction   form  as  shown in  Appendix  B.   
 The detail description  of the  data extraction form  can be

 We synthesized the  data by i  dentifying themes em  anating   
 from  the  findings  reported  in  each  of  the  paper  reviewed  in   
 this  study.  In  t  he  following  section,  we  present  frequencies

 The main aim is to improvement in the quality of image, perform other operation, extraction of information and to classify the image while doing image processing. It is effectively used in computer, medical and other related fields. The main problem is that it is generally a time-consuming process; Parallel computing (parallelism) provides an efficient and convenient way to address this issue. There are many challenges in Image processing like Filtering, Restoration and classification etc. In addition, it is also a time-consuming process. The solution of these challenges is to use a parallel computing technique known as parallel image processing. The main focus of this paper is to review and to provide the comparative study of the existing contributions of tools and techniques of parallel image processing and analysis between different technique which are MATLAB, CUDA, BIONIC, Hadoop and GPU (graphic Processing Unit) along with limitation and advantage of these tools and techniques. In this review, we also tried to discuss the architecture of these parallel image processing techniques.

 Incorporating social software into distributed agile development environments    
 Conference Paper    
 Full-text available    
  Filippo Lanubile 
 The use of social software applications, such as wikis and blogs, has emerged as a practical and economical option to consider as global teams may use them to organize, track, publish their work, and then, share knowledge. We intend to push further the application of social software principles and technologies into collaborative development environments for agile and distributed projects. As a first step, in this paper we first present a survey of social software, as well as tools and environments for collaborative development. Then, we present some opportunities and challenges of incorporating social software aspects in agile distributed development.

 Adopting Agile in Distributed Development    
 Conference Paper    
  J. Jagadish Shrinivasavadhani 
 Key challenges of finding right skilled resources and the cost arbitrage factors have made distributed software development indispensable for quite some time now. The success stories of many offshore service providers particularly from India underlines the fact that this is working well in a ""hands-free"" mode, especially for projects following traditional development life cycles. The recent trend is an increase in the number of organizations adopting agile methodologies to tackle the challenges of requirements volatility and shorter time to market. However, the concept of a collocated team which is central to agile does not easily translate to distributed development. This paper captures our experience at Wipro in handling Distributed Agile projects. We discuss a validated model to make a smooth transition from a collocated to a distributed scenario in agile projects. We also share the lessons learnt and best practices that we have gained in implementing this model.

  There is growing interest in applying agile practices in Global Software Development (GSD) projects. But project stakeholder distribution in GSD creates a number of challenges that make it difficult to use some agile practices. Moreover, little is known about what the key challenges or risks are, and how GSD project mangers deal with these risks while using agile practices. We conduct a ... [Show full abstract]  Systematic Literature Review (SLR) following existing guidelines to identify primary papers that discuss the use of Scrum practices in GSD projects. We identify key challenges, due to global project distribution, that restrict the use of Scrum and explore the strategies used by project managers to deal with these challenges. Our findings are consolidated into a conceptual framework and we discuss various elements of this framework. This research is relevant to project managers who are seeking ways to use Scrum in their globally distributed projects.

This paper develops a research framework from the literature as a basis for future research and practice. The framework maps current knowledge and views on how Scrum practices can be used to mitigate commonly recognized challenges in GSD. This research is useful as a reference guide for practitioners who are seeking to understand how Scrum practices can be used effectively in GSD, and for researchers as a research framework to validate and extend current knowledge.

 The 16th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2023)  will be held in Leicester, UK, as part of STAF 2023  (Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations). The conference takes place under the auspices of EASST, EATCS  , and IFIP WG 1.3  .  
 Aims and Scope   
 The use of graphs and graph-like structures as a formalism for specification and modelling is widespread in all areas of computer science as well as in many fields of computational research and engineering. Relevant examples include software architectures, pointer structures, state space and control/data flow graphs, UML and other domain-specific models, network layouts, topologies of cyber-physical environments, quantum computing and molecular structures. Often, these graphs undergo dynamic change, ranging from reconfiguration and evolution to various kinds of behaviour, all of which may be captured by rule-based graph manipulation. Thus, graphs and graph transformation form a fundamental universal modelling paradigm that serves as a means for formal reasoning and analysis, ranging from the verification of certain properties of interest to the discovery of fundamentally new insights.  
 ICGT aims at fostering exchange and collaboration of researchers from different backgrounds working with graphs and graph transformation, either in contributing to their theoretical foundations or by applying established formalisms to classical or novel areas. The conference not only serves as a well-established scientific publication outlet, but also as a platform to boost inter- and intra-disciplinary research and to leeway for new ideas.

 About ICSSP Conference Series  
 About ICSSP 2023  
 In recent years, innovative software and systems technologies have been rapidly adopted with increasingly widespread but uncertain impacts. These technologies include various forms of AI; big data and data science; blockchain and distributed ledgers; augmented, virtual, and extended reality; low-code/no-code platforms; and even quantum computing (among others). By their novel nature, these new technologies and applications demand new approaches to software and systems development. Beyond that, the novelty and uncertainty surrounding these technologies and applications requires new and more effective approaches and processes to assuring correctness, understandability, predictability, responsibility, security, ethics and other vital qualities of our software and systems.  
 At the same time, many of these new technologies may have applications within the software life cycle. So the question naturally arises, can we put technologies such as AI, blockchain, low code, and big data, to work in improving our ability to develop, manage, and apply new software and systems applications. We can even ask whether it will become essential to do so.  
 ICSSP 2023 is focusing on software and systems processes for and with these new technologies, as well as on incorporating these new technologies into new modes of working in software and systems development for business, government, society, and the environment. ICSSP 2023 aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to share their research findings, experiences, and new ideas on diverse topics related to software and system processes. For 2023, the theme of the conference is: "" Software and System Processes for and with Emerging Technologies  "". The goal is to advance both the state of the research and the state of the practice by applying innovative ideas from different fields of research to the future of software and system engineering processes.

 Shallow Camera Pipeline for Night Photography Enhancement  
 Target-Driven One-Shot Unsupervised Domain Adaptation  
  In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for the challenging problem of One-Shot Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (OS-UDA), which aims to adapt to a target domain with only a single unlabeled target sample. Unlike existing approaches that rely on large labeled source and unlabeled target data, our Target-Driven One-Shot UDA (TOS-UDA) approach employs a learnable augmentation strategy guided by the target sample’s style to align the source distribution with the target distribution. Our method consists of three modules: an augmentation module, a style alignment module, and a classifier. Unlike existing methods, our augmentation module allows for strong transformations of the source samples, and the style of the single target sample available is exploited to guide the augmentation by ensuring perceptual similarity. Furthermore, our approach integrates augmentation with style alignment, eliminating the need for separate pre-training on additional datasets. Our method outperforms or performs comparably to existing OS-UDA methods on the Digits and DomainNet benchmarks.

 Combining Identity Features and Artifact Analysis for Differential Morphing Attack Detection  
  Due to the importance of the Morphing Attack, the development of new and accurate Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) systems is urgently needed by private and public institutions. In this context, D-MAD methods, i.e. detectors fed with a trusted live image and a probe tend to show better performance with respect to S-MAD approaches, that are based on a single input image. However, D-MAD methods usually leverage the identity of the two input face images only, and then present two main drawbacks: they lose performance when the two subjects look alike, and they do not consider potential artifacts left by the morphing procedure (which are instead typically exploited by S-MAD approaches). Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the combined use of D-MAD and S-MAD to improve detection performance through the fusion of the features produced by these two MAD approaches.

 SynthCap: Augmenting Transformers with Synthetic Data for Image Captioning  
  Image captioning is a challenging task that combines Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing to generate descriptive and accurate textual descriptions for input images. Research efforts in this field mainly focus on developing novel architectural components to extend image captioning models and using large-scale image-text datasets crawled from the web to boost final performance. In this work, we explore an alternative to web-crawled data and augment the training dataset with synthetic images generated by a latent diffusion model. In particular, we propose a simple yet effective synthetic data augmentation framework that is capable of significantly improving the quality of captions generated by a standard Transformer-based model, leading to competitive results on the COCO dataset.

 FERMOUTH: Facial Emotion Recognition from the MOUTH Region  
  People use various nonverbal communicative channels to convey emotions, among which facial expressions are considered the most important ones. Consequently, automatic Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is a crucial task for enhancing computers’ perceptive abilities, particularly in human-computer interaction. Although state-of-the-art FER systems can identify emotions from the entire face, situations may arise where occlusions prevent the entire face from being visible. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many FER systems have been developed for recognizing emotions from the eye region due to the obligation to wear a mask. However, in many situations, the eyes may be covered, for instance, by sunglasses or virtual reality devices. In this paper, we faced the problem of developing a FER system that solely considers the mouth region and classifies emotions using only the lower part of the face. We tested the effectiveness of this FER system in recognizing emotions from the lower part of the face and compared the results to a FER system trained on the same datasets using the same approach on the entire face. As expected, emotions primarily associated with the mouth region (e.g., happiness, surprise) were recognized with minimal loss compared to the entire face. Nevertheless, even though most negative emotions were not accurately detected using only the mouth region, in cases where the face is partially covered, this area may still provide some information about the displayed emotion.

 Towards Facial Expression Robustness in Multi-scale Wild Environments  
  Facial expressions are dynamic processes that evolve over temporal segments, including onset, apex, offset, and neutral. However, previous works on automatic facial expression analysis have mainly focused on the recognition of discrete emotions, neglecting the continuous nature of these processes. Additionally, facial images captured from videos in the wild often have varying resolutions due to fixed-lens cameras. To address these problems, our objective is to develop a robust facial expression recognition classifier that provides good performance in such challenging environments. We evaluated several state-of-the-art models on labeled and unlabeled collections and analyzed their performance at different scales. To improve performance, we filtered the probabilities provided by each classifier and demonstrated that this improves decision-making consistency by more than 10%, leading to accuracy improvement. Finally, we combined the models’ backbones into a temporal-sequence classifier, leveraging this consistency-performance trade-off and achieving an additional improvement of 9.6%.

 Improved Bilinear Pooling for Real-Time Pose Event Camera Relocalisation  
  Traditional methods for estimating camera pose have been replaced by more advanced camera relocalization methods that utilize both CNNs and LSTMs in the field of simultaneous localization and mapping. However, the reliance on LSTM layers in these methods can lead to overfitting and slow convergence. In this paper, a novel approach for estimating the six degree of freedom (6DOF) pose of an event camera using deep learning is presented. Our method begins by preprocessing the events captured by the event camera to generate a set of images. These images are then passed through two CNNs to extract relevant features. These features are multiplied using an outer product and aggregated across different regions of the image after adding L2 normalization to normalize the combining vector. The final step of the model is a regression layer that predicts the position and orientation of the event camera. The effectiveness of this approach has been tested on various datasets, and the results demonstrate its superiority compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

 A Large-scale Analysis of Athletes’ Cumulative Race Time in Running Events  
  Action recognition models and cumulative race time (CRT) are practical tools in sports analytics, providing insights into athlete performance, training, and strategy. Measuring CRT allows for identifying areas for improvement, such as specific sections of a racecourse or the effectiveness of different strategies. Human action recognition (HAR) algorithms can help to optimize performance, with machine learning and artificial intelligence providing real-time feedback to athletes. This paper presents a comparative study of HAR algorithms for CRT regression, examining two important factors: the frame rate and the regressor selection. Our results indicate that our proposal exhibits outstanding performance for short input footage, achieving a mean absolute error of 11 min when estimating CRT for runners that have been on the course for durations ranging from 8 to 20 h.

 Active Class Selection for Dataset Acquisition in Sign Language Recognition  
  Dataset collection for Sign Language Recognition (SLR) represents a challenging and crucial step in the development of modern automatic SLR systems. Typical acquisition protocols do not follow specific strategies, simply trying to gather equally represented classes. In this paper we provide some empirical evidences that alternative, more clever, strategies can be really beneficial, leading to a better performance of classification systems. In particular, we investigate the exploitation of ideas and tools of Active Class Selection (ACS), a peculiar Active Learning (AL) context specifically devoted to scenarios in which new data is labelled at the same time it is generated. In particular, differently from standard AL where a strategy asks for a specific label from an available set of unlabelled data, ACS strategies define from which class it is more convenient to acquire a new sample. In this paper, we show the beneficial effect of these methods in the SLR scenario, where these concepts have never been investigated. We studied both standard and novel ACS approaches, with experiments based on a challenging dataset recently collected for an ECCV challenge. We also preliminary investigate other possible exploitations of ACS ideas, for example to select which would be, for the classification system, the most beneficial signer.

 MC-GTA: A Synthetic Benchmark for Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking  
 Learning Landmarks Motion from Speech for Speaker-Agnostic 3D Talking Heads Generation  
  This paper presents a novel approach for generating 3D talking heads from raw audio inputs. Our method grounds on the idea that speech related movements can be comprehensively and efficiently described by the motion of a few control points located on the movable parts of the face, i.e., landmarks. The underlying musculoskeletal structure then allows us to learn how their motion influences the geometrical deformations of the whole face. The proposed method employs two distinct models to this aim: the first one learns to generate the motion of a sparse set of landmarks from the given audio. The second model expands such landmarks motion to a dense motion field, which is utilized to animate a given 3D mesh in neutral state. Additionally, we introduce a novel loss function, named Cosine Loss, which minimizes the angle between the generated motion vectors and the ground truth ones. Using landmarks in 3D talking head generation offers various advantages such as consistency, reliability, and obviating the need for manual-annotation. Our approach is designed to be identity-agnostic, enabling high-quality facial animations for any users without additional data or training. Code and models are available at: S2L+S2D .

 Benchmarking of Blind Video Deblurring Methods on Long Exposure and Resource Poor Settings  
  This paper presents a benchmark evaluation of blind video deblurring methods in specific challenging settings. The employed videos are affected by severe deblurring artifacts and acquisition conditions (e.g., low resolution, high exposure, camera motion, complex scene motion, etc.). An in depth state of the art investigation has been carried out. Then, a specific set of methods based on mathematical optimization with image priors has been involved in our benchmark evaluation. The selected methods have been evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively.

 LieToMe: An LSTM-Based Method for Deception Detection by Hand Movements  
  The ability to detect lies is a crucial skill in essential situations like police interrogations and court trials. At present, several devices, such as polygraphs and magnetic resonance, can ease the deception detection task. However, the effectiveness of these tools can be compromised by intentional behavioral changes due to the subject awareness of such appliances, suggesting that alternative ways must be explored to detect lies without using physical devices. In this context, this paper presents an approach focused on the extraction of meaningful features from hand gestures. The latter provide cues on the person’s behavior and are used to address the deception detection task in RGB videos of trials. Specifically, the proposed system extracts hands skeletons from an RGB video sequence and generates novel handcrafted features from the extrapolated keypoints to reflect the subject behavior through hand movements. Then, a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network is used to classify these features and estimate whether the person is lying or not. Extensive experiments were performed to assess the quality of the derived features on a public collection of famous real-life trials. On this dataset, the proposed system sets new state-of-the-art performance on the unimodal hand-gesture deception detection task, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its handcrafted features.

 Real-Time GAN-Based Model for Underwater Image Enhancement  
  Enhancing image quality is crucial for achieving an accurate and reliable image analysis in vision-based automated tasks. Underwater imaging encounters several challenges that can negatively impact image quality, including limited visibility, color distortion, contrast sensitivity issues, and blurriness. Among these, depending on how the water filters out the different light colors at different depths, the color distortion results in a loss of color information and a blue or green tint to the overall image, making it difficult to identify different underwater organisms or structures accurately. Improved underwater image quality can be crucial in marine biology, oceanography, and oceanic exploration. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture for underwater image enhancement, restoring good perceptual quality to obtain a more precise and detailed image. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on the EUVP dataset, which comprises underwater image samples of various visibility conditions, achieving remarkable results. Moreover, the trained network is run on the RPi4B as an embedded system to measure the time required to enhance the images with limited computational resources, simulating a practical underwater investigation setting. The outcome demonstrates the presented method applicability in real-world underwater exploration scenarios.

 HERO: A Multi-modal Approach on Mobile Devices for Visual-Aware Conversational Assistance in Industrial Domains  
  We present HERO, an artificial assistant designed to communicate with users with both natural language and images to aid them carrying out procedures in industrial contexts. Our system is composed of five modules: 1) the input module retrieves user utterances and collects raw data, such as text and images, 2) the Natural Language Processing module processes text from user utterances, 3) the object detector module extracts entities by analyzing images captured by the user, 4) the Question Answering module generates responses to users’ specific questions on procedures, and 5) the output module selects the final response to give to the user. We deployed and evaluated the system in an industrial laboratory furnished with different tools and equipment for carrying out repair and test operations on electrical boards. In this setting, the HERO system allows the user to retrieve information on tools, equipment, procedures, and safety rules. Experiments on domain-specific labeled data, as well as a user study suggest that the design of our system is robust and that its use can be beneficial for users over classic methods for retrieving information and guide workers, such as printed manuals.

 A Computer Vision-Based Water Level Monitoring System for Touchless and Sustainable Water Dispensing  
  In recent years, the need for contactless and sustainable systems has become increasingly relevant. The traditional water dispensers, which require contact with the dispenser and often involve single-use plastic cups or bottles, are not only unhygienic but also contribute to environmental pollution. This paper presents a touchless water dispenser system that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to control the dispensing of water or any liquid beverage. The system is designed to fill a container under the nozzle, dispense water when the container is aligned with the flow, and stop dispensing when the container is full, all without requiring any physical contact. This approach ensures compliance with hygiene regulations and promotes environmental sustainability by eliminating the need for plastic bottles or cups, making it a “plastic-free” and “zero waste” system. The prototype is based on a computer vision approach that employs an RGB camera and a Raspberry Pi board, which allows for real-time image processing and machine learning operations. The system uses image processing techniques to detect the presence of a container under the nozzle and then utilizes AI algorithms to control the flow of liquid. The system is trained using machine learning models and optimized to ensure accuracy and efficiency. We discuss the development and implementation of the touchless water dispenser system, including the hardware and software components used, the algorithms employed, and the testing and evaluation of the system. The results of our experiments show that the touchless water dispenser system is highly accurate and efficient, and it offers a safe and sustainable alternative to traditional water dispensers. The system has the potential to be used in a variety of settings, including public spaces, hospitals, schools, and offices, where hygiene and sustainability are of utmost importance.

 Hand Gesture Recognition Exploiting Handcrafted Features and LSTM  
  Hand gesture recognition finds application in several heterogeneous fields, such as Human-Computer Interaction, serious games, sign language interpretation, and more. Modern recognition approaches use Deep Learning methods due to their ability in extracting features without human intervention. The drawback of this approach is the need for huge datasets which, depending on the task, are not always available. In some cases, handcrafted features increase the capability of a model in achieving the proposed task, and usually require fewer data with respect to Deep Learning approaches. In this paper, we propose a method that synergistically makes use of handcrafted features and Deep Learning for performing hand gesture recognition. Concerning the features, they are engineered from hand joints, while for Deep Learning, a simple LSTM together with a multilayer perceptron is used. The tests were performed on the DHG dataset, comparing the proposed method with both state-of-the-art methods that use handcrafted features and methods that use learned features. Our approach overcomes the state-of-the-art handcrafted features methods in both 14 and 28 gestures recognition tests, while we overcome the state-of-the-art learned features methods for the 14 gesture recognition test, proving that it is possible to use a simpler model with well engineered features.

 An Optimized Pipeline for Image-Based Localization in Museums from Egocentric Images  
  With the increasing interest in augmented and virtual reality, visual localization is acquiring a key role in many downstream applications requiring a real-time estimate of the user location only from visual streams. In this paper, we propose an optimized hierarchical localization pipeline by specifically tackling cultural heritage sites with specific applications in museums. Specifically, we propose to enhance the Structure from Motion (SfM) pipeline for constructing the sparse 3D point cloud by a-priori filtering blurred and near-duplicated images. We also study an improved inference pipeline that merges similarity-based localization with geometric pose estimation to effectively mitigate the effect of strong outliers. We show that the proposed optimized pipeline obtains the lowest localization error on the challenging Bellomo dataset [11]. Our proposed approach keeps both build and inference times bounded, in turn enabling the deployment of this pipeline in real-world scenarios.

 Annotating the Inferior Alveolar Canal: The Ultimate Tool  
  The Inferior Alveolar Nerve (IAN) is of main interest in the maxillofacial field, as an accurate localization of such nerve reduces the risks of injury during surgical procedures. Although recent literature has focused on developing novel deep learning techniques to produce accurate segmentation masks of the canal containing the IAN, there are still strong limitations due to the scarce amount of publicly available 3D maxillofacial datasets. In this paper, we present an improved version of a previously released tool, iacat (Inferior Alveolar Canal Annotation Tool), today used by medical experts to produce 3D ground truth annotation. In addition, we release a new dataset, ToothFairy, which is part of the homonymous MICCAI2023 challenge hosted by the Grand-Challenge platform, as an extension of the previously released Maxillo dataset, which was the only publicly available. With ToothFairy, the number of annotations has been increased as well as the quality of existing data.

 Enhancing PFI Prediction with GDS-MIL: A Graph-Based Dual Stream MIL Approach  
  Whole-Slide Images (WSI) are emerging as a promising resource for studying biological tissues, demonstrating a great potential in aiding cancer diagnosis and improving patient treatment. However, the manual pixel-level annotation of WSIs is extremely time-consuming and practically unfeasible in real-world scenarios. Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) have gained attention as a weakly supervised approach able to address lack of annotation tasks. MIL models aggregate patches (e.g., cropping of a WSI) into bag-level representations (e.g., WSI label), but neglect spatial information of the WSIs, crucial for histological analysis. In the High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer (HGSOC) context, spatial information is essential to predict a prognosis indicator (the Platinum-Free Interval, PFI) from WSIs. Such a prediction would bring highly valuable insights both for patient treatment and prognosis of chemotherapy resistance. Indeed, NeoAdjuvant ChemoTherapy (NACT) induces changes in tumor tissue morphology and composition, making the prediction of PFI from WSIs extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose GDS-MIL, a method that integrates a state-of-the-art MIL model with a Graph ATtention layer (GAT in short) to inject a local context into each instance before MIL aggregation. Our approach achieves a significant improvement in accuracy on the “Ome18” PFI dataset. In summary, this paper presents a novel solution for enhancing PFI prediction in HGSOC, with the potential of significantly improving treatment decisions and patient outcomes.

 On-Device Learning with Binary Neural Networks  
  Existing Continual Learning (CL) solutions only partially address the constraints on power, memory and computation of the deep learning models when deployed on low-power embedded CPUs. In this paper, we propose a CL solution that embraces the recent advancements in CL field and the efficiency of the Binary Neural Networks (BNN), that use 1-bit for weights and activations to efficiently execute deep learning models. We propose a hybrid quantization of CWR* (an effective CL approach) that considers differently forward and backward pass in order to retain more precision during gradient update step and at the same time minimizing the latency overhead. The choice of a binary network as backbone is essential to meet the constraints of low power devices and, to the best of authors’ knowledge, this is the first attempt to prove on-device learning with BNN. The experimental validation carried out confirms the validity and the suitability of the proposed method.

 Towards One-Shot PCB Component Detection with YOLO  
  Consumer electronic devices such as smartphones, TV sets, etc. are designed around printed circuit boards (PCBs) with a large number of surface mounted components. The pick and place machine soldering these components on the PCB may pick the wrong component, may solder the component in the wrong position or fail to solder it at all. Therefore, Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) is essential to detect the above defects even prior to electric tests by comparing populated PCBs with the schematics. In this context, we leverage YOLO, a deep convolutional architecture designed for one-shot object detection, for AOI of PCBs. This architecture enables real-time processing of large images and can be trained end-to-end. In this work we also exploit a modified architecture of YOLOv5 designed to detect small components of which boards are often highly populated. Moreover, we proposed a strategy to transfer weights from the original pre-trained model to this improved one. We report here our experimental setup and some performance measures.

 Automated Identification of Failure Cases in Organ at Risk Segmentation Using Distance Metrics: A Study on CT Data  
  Automated organ at risk (OAR) segmentation is crucial for radiation therapy planning in CT scans, but the generated contours by automated models can be inaccurate, potentially leading to treatment planning issues. The reasons for these inaccuracies could be varied, such as unclear organ boundaries or inaccurate ground truth due to annotation errors. To improve the model’s performance, it is necessary to identify these failure cases during the training process and to correct them with some potential post-processing techniques. However, this process can be time-consuming, as traditionally it requires manual inspection of the predicted output. This paper proposes a method to automatically identify failure cases by setting a threshold for the combination of Dice and Hausdorff distances. This approach reduces the time-consuming task of visually inspecting predicted outputs, allowing for faster identification of failure case candidates. The method was evaluated on 20 cases of six different organs in CT images from clinical expert curated datasets. By setting the thresholds for the Dice and Hausdorff distances, the study was able to differentiate between various states of failure cases and evaluate over 12 cases visually. This thresholding approach could be extended to other organs, leading to faster identification of failure cases and thereby improving the quality of radiation therapy planning.

 Digitizer: A Synthetic Dataset for Well-Log Analysis  
  Raster well-log images are digital representations of paper copies that retain the original analog data gathered during subsurface drilling. Geologists heavily rely on these images to interpret well-log curves and gain insights into the geological formations beneath the surface. However, manually extracting and analyzing data from these images is time-consuming and demanding. To tackle these challenges, researchers increasingly turn to computer vision and machine learning techniques to assist in the analysis process. Nonetheless, developing such approaches, mainly those dependent on machine learning requires a sufficient number of accurately labelled samples for model training and fine-tuning. Unfortunately, this is not a straightforward task, as existing datasets are derived from scanned hand-compiled paper copies, resulting in digital images that suffer from noise and errors. Furthermore, these samples only represent images and not the digital signals of the measured natural phenomena. To overcome these obstacles, we present a new synthetic dataset that includes both images and digital signals of well-logs. This dataset aims to facilitate more effective and accurate analysis techniques, addressing the limitations of current methods. By utilizing this dataset, researchers and practitioners can develop solutions that mitigate the shortcomings of existing methods, ultimately leading to more reliable and precise results in interpreting well-log curves and understanding subsurface geological formations.

 Abstracts Embeddings Evaluation: A Case Study of Artificial Intelligence and Medical Imaging for the COVID-19 Infection  
  During the COVID-19 pandemic, a huge amount of literature was produced covering different aspects of infection. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging has been shown to improve screening, diagnosis, treatment, and medication for the COVID-19 virus. Applying natural language processing (NLP) solutions to COVID-19 literature has contributed to infer significant COVID-19-related topics and correlated diseases. In this paper, we aim at evaluating biomedical transformer-based NLP techniques in COVID-19 research to understand if they are able to classify problems related to COVID-19. Particularly, once collected COVID-19 publications encompassing the terms AI and medical imaging, fifteen BERT-based models have been compared with respect to modality prediction and task prediction.

 Towards a Better Understanding of Human Emotions: Challenges of Dataset Labeling  
  A major challenge in automatic human emotion recognition is that of categorizing the very broad and complex spectrum of human emotions. In this regard, a critical bottleneck is represented by the difficulty in obtaining annotated data to build such models. Indeed, all the publicly available datasets collected to this aim are either annotated with (i) the six prototypical emotions, or (ii) continuous valence/arousal (VA) values. On the one hand, the six basic emotions represent a coarse approximation of the vast spectrum of human emotions, and are of limited utility to understand a person’s emotional state. Oppositely, performing dimensional emotion recognition using VA can cover the full range of human emotions, yet it lacks a clear interpretation. Moreover, data annotation with VA is challenging as it requires expert annotators, and there is no guarantee that annotations are consistent with the six prototypical emotions. In this paper, we present an investigation aiming to bridge the gap between the two modalities. We propose to leverage VA values to obtain a fine-grained taxonomy of emotions, interpreting emotional states as probability distributions over the VA space. This has the potential for enabling automatic annotation of existing datasets with this new taxonomy, avoiding the need for expensive data collection and labeling. However, our preliminary results disclose two major problems: first, continuous VA values and the six standard emotion labels are often inconsistent, raising concerns about the validity of existing datasets; second, datasets claimed to be balanced in terms of emotion labels become instead severely unbalanced if provided with a fine-grained emotion annotation. We conclude that efforts are needed in terms of data collection to further push forward the research in this field.

 ONFIRE Contest 2023: Real-Time Fire Detection on the Edge  
  ONFIRE Contest 2023 is a competition, organized within ICIAP 2023 conference, among methods based on deep learning, aimed at the recognition of fire from videos in real-time on edge devices. This topic is inspiring various research groups for the underlying security reasons and for the growing necessity to realize a system that allows to safeguard the territory from the enormous damage that fires can cause. The participants are required to design fire detection methods, starting from a training set that consists of videos in which fire (flames and/or smoke) is present (positive samples), and others (negative samples) that do not contain a fire. The videos have been collected from existing datasets by selecting as positive videos only those that really frame a fire and not flames and smoke in controlled conditions, and as negative videos the ones that contain moving objects that can be confused with flames or smoke. Since the videos are collected in different conditions, the dataset is very heterogeneous in terms of image resolution, illumination, pixel size of flame or smoke, background activity, scenario (urban or wildfire). The submitted methods are evaluated over a private test set, whose videos are different from the ones available in the training set; this choice allows to test the approaches in realistic conditions, namely in unknown operative scenarios. The proposed experimental protocol allows to measure not only the accuracy but also the computational resources required by the methods, so that the top-rank approaches will be both effective and suited for real-time processing on the edge.

 Generalized Deepfake Detection Algorithm Based on Inconsistency Between Inner and Outer Faces  
  Deepfake refers to using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques to create compelling and realistic media content, such as videos, images, or recordings, that appear real but are fake. The most common form of deepfake involves using deep neural networks to replace or superimpose faces in existing videos or images on top of other people’s faces. While this technology can be used for various benign purposes, such as filmmaking or online education, it can also be used maliciously to spread misinformation by creating fake videos or images. Based on the classic deepfake generation process, this paper explores the Inconsistency between inner and outer faces in fake content to find synthetic defects and proposes a general deepfake detection algorithm. Experimental results show that our proposed method has certain advantages, especially regarding cross-method detection performance.

 Real-Time Multiclass Face Spoofing Recognition Through Spatiotemporal Convolutional 3D Features  
  Face recognition is used in numerous authentication applications, unfortunately they are susceptible to spoofing attacks such as paper and screen attacks. In this paper, we propose a method that is able to recognise if a face detected in a video is not real and the type of attack performed on the fake video. We propose to learn the temporal features exploiting a 3D Convolution Network that is more suitable for temporal information. The 3D ConvNet, other than summarizing temporal information, allows us to build a real-time method since it is so much more efficient to analyse clips instead of analyzing single frames. The learned features are classified using a binary classifier to distinguish if the person in the clip video is real (i.e. live) or not, multi class classifier recognises if the person is real or the type of attack (screen, paper, ect.). We performed our test on 5 public datasets: Replay Attack, Replay Mobile, MSU-MSFD, Rose-Youtu, RECOD-MPAD.

 Enhancing Air Quality Forecasting Through Deep Learning and Continuous Wavelet Transform  
  Air quality forecasting plays a crucial role in environmental management and public health. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines deep learning techniques with the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) for air quality forecasting based on sensor data. The proposed methodology is agnostic to the target pollutant and can be applied to estimate any available pollutant without loss of generality. The pipeline consists of two main steps: the generation of stacked samples from raw sensor signals using CWT, and the prediction through a custom deep neural network based on the ResNet18 architecture.We compare our approach with traditional one-dimensional signal processing models. The results show that our 2D pipeline, employing the Morlet mother wavelet, outperforms the baselines significantly. The localized time-frequency representations obtained through CWT highlight hidden dynamics and relationships within the parameter behavior and external factors, leading to more accurate predictions. Overall, our approach demonstrates the potential to advance air quality forecasting and environmental management for healthier living environments worldwide.

 Automatic Alignment of Multi-scale Aerial and Underwater Photogrammetric Point Clouds: A Case Study in the Maldivian Coral Reef  
  The research question that the paper investigates is whether the usage of state of the art algorithms for point clouds registration solves the problem of multi-scale vision-based point clouds registration in mixed aerial and underwater environments. This paper reports very preliminary results on the data we have been able to procure, in the context of a coral reef restoration project nearby Magoodhoo Island (Maldives). The results obtained by exploiting state of the art algorithms are promising, considering that those data presents hard samples, in particular for their multi-scale nature (noise in captured 3D points increases with depth). However, further investigation on larger data-sets is needed to confirm the overall applicability of the current algorithms to this problem.

 Generative Data Augmentation of Human Biomechanics  
  Wearable sensors are miniature and affordable devices used for monitoring human motion in daily life. Data-driven models applied to wearable sensor data can enhance the accuracy of movement analysis outside of controlled settings. However, obtaining a large and representative database for training these models is challenging due to the specialised motion laboratories and expensive equipment required. To address this limitation, this study proposes a data augmentation approach using generative deep learning to enhance biomechanical datasets. A novel conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) was developed to synthesise biomechanical data during gait. The GAN takes into account the subject’s anthropometric measures to generate data that represents specific body types as well as information about the gait cycle for reconstruction back into the time domain. The proposed model was evaluated for generating biomechanical data of unseen subjects and fine-tuning the model with small percentages (1%, 2% and 5%) of the test dataset. Researchers and practitioners can overcome the limitations of obtaining large training datasets from human participants by synthesising realistic and diverse synthetic data. This paper outlines the methodology and experimental setup for developing and evaluating the GAN and discusses its potential impact on the field of biomechanics and human motion analysis.

 Avatar Reaction to Multimodal Human Behavior  
  In this paper, we propose a virtual agent application. We develop a virtual agent that reacts to gestures and a virtual environment in which it can interact with the user. We capture motion with a Kinect V2 camera, predict the end of the motion and then classify it. The application also features a facial expression recognition module. In addition, to all these modules, we include also OpenAI conversation module. The application can also be used with a virtual reality headset.

   Artificial Intelligence(AI) and Internet of Things(IoT) Technologies in Healthcare Applications: Heart and Brain Case Studies   
 Abstract  
 Disadvantaged communities across the world are disproportionately affected by a lack of access to healthcare with high societal and individual costs. Conditions such as congenital heart disease and brain seizures can have devastating effects if not detected in time. The main issue is that there is often a lack of trained personnel and/or expensive equipment to detect these conditions. Advances in the Internet of Things and AI technologies can provide reliable, low-cost solutions to detect these conditions without disrupting existing hospital protocols and operating within a secure framework. In our approach, solutions that involve the communion between the medical professional and AI are of special interest. These solutions must be explainable to gain wider acceptance in a medical setting. The presentation will discuss some implementations using EDGE and IoT platforms for an AI-driven auscultation for congenital heart disease and AI-driven sonification of brainwaves. Some aspects of IoT/EDGE security will also be briefly discussed.
