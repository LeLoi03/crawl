  Introduction   
 NSPW 2024   will be held on September 16-19, 2024 in Bedford, PA USA. Submissions were due April 28, 2024.  
 The New Security Paradigms Workshop (NSPW) is an annual, small invitation-only workshop for researchers in information security and related disciplines. NSPW's focus is on work that challenges the dominant approaches and perspectives in computer security. In the past, such challenges have taken the form of critiques of existing practice as well as novel, sometimes controversial, and often immature approaches to defending computer systems. By providing a forum for important security research that isn't suitable for mainstream security venues, NSPW aims to foster paradigm shifts  in information security.  
 NSPW is an ACSA  conference. The proceedings of NSPW are published by the ACM  . Full proceedings are available  .
