 MT Summit 2023    
 2nd Call for Papers and Presentations    
 ===================================================================    
 With the coming of the MT Summit XIX, the 19th Machine Translation Summit, held from September 4 to 8, 2023, we are pleased to announce that we are putting out a call for papers and presentations, as well as for proposals for workshops and tutorials.    
 COVID-19 has forced many international conferences to go fully online, and this was no different for the previous MT Summit. This time, however, we’re looking to provide both real opportunities for face-to-face discussions and for encounters that take place online.    
 The conference will take place in the convention center located on the Cotai Strip, which is at the heart of modern Macao’s accommodation, event, and entertainment offerings. We will also continue to monitor the pandemic situation closely to ensure the safety of participants, and, if necessary, will convert to a completely virtual format.    
 The MT Summit XIX is organized by the Asia-Pacific Association for Machine Translation. This biennial MT Summit brings together the Asian-Pacific (AAMT), American (AMTA), and European (EAMT) branches of the International Association for Machine Translation (IAMT), creating an invaluable opportunity to discuss the issues of the day with a truly global gathering of all the stakeholders of machine translation. This includes researchers of MT and translation, developers, providers, translators, and general users. For researchers, MT Summit XIX provides a unique context in which to share their latest results with colleagues, as well as an opportunity to understand real-world user requirements. MT providers, translators, and general users in both business and government settings will benefit from updates on leading-edge R&D in Machine Translation and have a chance to present and discuss their own use cases. In all of these contexts, we strongly encourage and hope that students will also make submissions and participate.

 IMPORTANT NOTE   : Due to the hybrid nature of the conference, all papers, presentations, tutorials, and workshops will be recorded without exception. Any submission will be understood by the MT Summit Organizing Committee as giving your tacit permission for the organizers to create a video recording of your presentation and make it available to conference attendees, and potentially to members of AMTA, AAMT, or EAMT as well. We also request that all remote representations be pre-recorded.    
 Conference Tracks    
 The conference will feature two main tracks – Research  and Users  , each dedicated to a respective area in machine translation research and user research & experiences. The final presentation format is either oral or poster.    
 Guidelines for submission to the tracks of the conference are as follows:    
 Research Track    
 Chairs: Masao Utiyama and Rui Wang (  mt-summit-2023-research-track@googlegroups.com    )    
 We invite original, substantial, and unpublished research in all aspects of machine translation (MT). We seek submissions across the entire spectrum of MT-related research, but with a particular focus on MT Summit’s strength: the close interaction between researchers and practitioners who are looking to apply the latest MT technology to their tasks. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:    
 Advances in data-driven MT (e.g. neural, statistical) 
  Lexicon acquisition and integration into MT 
  Detecting and preventing Catastrophic errors in Translation 
  Best practices in annotation for Translation 
  Submission Instructions:    
 Papers should not be longer than 10 pages of content (for references, unlimited number of pages is allowed). The papers must follow the MT Summit 2023 style guides (  PDF version    ,  LaTeX version    ,  MS Word version    , and  Overleaf template    ) and be submitted in PDF format. To allow for blind reviewing, please do not include author names and affiliations within the paper and avoid obvious self-references.    
 Publication    
 Final versions of papers must be submitted by the final “camera-ready” date. All Research track papers will be included in the conference proceedings, which will be made publicly available on the MT Summit website. Papers will also be hosted individually on the ACL Anthology website.    
 Users Track    
 Chairs: Masaru Yamada and Félix do Carmo (  mt-summit-2023-users-track@googlegroups.com    )    
 This track calls for participation of innovative and unpublished papers and presentations describing studies on general conditions of usage of MT products, both by end users, who consume its raw products for purposes like gisting, as well as by translators and other professional services, who use MT for producing quality translations by the process of post-editing.    
 In addition, we are looking for papers/reports on the status of MT literacy and education, aiming to enlighten users on the proper use of MT, and on MT use cases in specific domains, including local government, public services, academia and schools. Studies related to positive outcomes brought by the use of MT, but also to its shortcomings and limitations, risks, ethical concerns and others related to the use of MT outside of research labs are also welcome to this track. Submissions by MT technology and service providers should present analyses of innovative MT use cases, rather than focus on projects, products or service offerings.

 Submission instructions    
 Publication    
 If the abstract or the paper is accepted, final versions of papers, abstracts, or slide decks must be submitted by the final camera-ready date for publication, in PDF format, via the SUBMISSION WEBSITE indicated above. All papers and presentations received by the camera-ready deadline will be published in the conference proceedings and on the ACL Anthology website.    
 As indicated in the call for papers, we anticipate high-quality submissions for the User Track, addressing topics such as machine translation (MT) literacy and education, domain-specific MT use cases, and research on the positive outcomes, limitations, risks, and ethical concerns related to MT usage. We have modified the standard call for papers process, and as such, we request abstract submissions by May 1st. Full papers should be submitted by July 10th to be included in the conference proceedings.The conference will be held in a hybrid format, and we hope that a significant number of attendees will be able to gather in Macau for stimulating post-presentation discussions.    
 Additionally, we are currently organizing a range of engaging events to take place during the main conference.
