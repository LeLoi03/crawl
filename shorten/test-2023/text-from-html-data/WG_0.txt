 Aims and Scopes  
 WG is mainly concerned with efficient algorithms of various types (e.g. sequential, parallel, distributed, randomized, parameterized) for problems on graphs and networks. The goal is to present recent results and to identify and explore directions for future research. Submitted papers should describe original results in any aspects of graph theory related to computer science, including but not restricted to:  
 design and analysis of sequential, parallel, randomized, parameterized algorithms 
  distributed graph and network algorithms 
 The call for papers can be found here  .

 Best Paper and Best Student Paper  
 The WG 2023 Best Paper award has been given to Paul Jungeblut, Samuel Schneider and Torsten Ueckerdt for their paper “Cops and Robber – When Capturing is not Surrounding” and the WG 2023 Best Student Paper Award has been given to Falko Hegerfeld and Stefan Kratsch for their paper “Tight Algorithms for Connectivity Problems Parameterized by Modular-Treewidth”. Both awards are sponsored by Springer.
