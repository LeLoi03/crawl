CP 2023  August 27â€“31, 2023, Toronto, Canada   
 Call for Papers  
 Twenty-Ninth Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming CP 2023 ( cp2023.a4cp.org  )  
 August 27-31, 2023, Toronto, Canada   
 CP is the premier international event for presenting research in all aspects of computing with constraints, including, but not restricted to: theory, algorithms, environments, languages, models, systems, and applications. CP 2023 will be held in-person in Toronto at the University of Toronto St. George campus (Downtown), August 27-31, 2023.  
 It welcomes submissions that advance the state of the art for the underlying technologies as well as papers that explore the role of constraint programming within other disciplines such as: operations research, machine learning, computational sustainability, and (cyber)security. Alongside submissions on constraint solving, NP-hard problem solving and constrained optimization in general, we also encourage and welcome submissions that reach beyond classic constraint programming concepts, for example: any underlying computational technique operating on a declarative constraint model, quantum computing with constraints, etc.  
 Tracks  
 Besides the main technical track, CP 2023 hosts 4 specialized tracks:  
 Applications 
  CP and Machine Learning 
  CP and Operations Research 
  Trustworthy Decision-Making 
  For papers to the Applications Track, we encourage authors to emphasize the practical significance of the application, which will be taken into consideration.

 In addition, a "Fast Track" submission process coordinated with the SAT 2023 Conference ( satisfiability.org/SAT23  ) is planned. Papers not accepted to SAT 2023 can be revised and submitted to CP 2023 with the proviso that the research is also relevant to the CP conference. Papers for the SAT Fast Track have the following requirements:  
 Previously submitted to the SAT 2023 conference 
  The paper overall evaluation scores from SAT 2023 have: | An average positive score | ; and 
  At least one review score of two or higher. 
  Supplementary material must be submitted as a single ZIP file with: | PDF of the SAT 2023 submission; 
  PDF of the all the SAT 2023 reviews; and 
  Cover letter detailing the changes between the CP 2023 and SAT 2023 submissions. 
  The abstract and submission deadlines for the SAT Fast Track are: (please note that the fast track deadlines differ from the other CP track submission dates).  
 SAT fast track abstract registration: | May 1 | May 2, 2023 
  SAT fast track paper submission: May 17, 2023 (unchanged) 
  (Please note that the fast track deadlines differ from the regular CP submission dates.)  
 Submission Instructions  
 The submission Web page for CP2023 is easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cp2023  .  
 Papers should be submitted in the form of a PDF file following LIPIcs guidelines ( submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/5#author  ).  
 To open the conference more widely, two types of submissions are expected:  
 Full papers, that can use up to 15 pages (references excluded). 
  Short papers, that can use a maximum of 8 pages (references excluded). Short papers cover early results or results that can be adequately reported in 8 pages. They must nonetheless meet all the expected quality criteria of a CP paper within the 8-page limit. 
  Both full and short papers should attract a wide audience and will be allocated time for presentation during the conference.  
 In addition to the paper PDF, it is possible to submit optional supplementary material such as appendix, code, data, etc. Reviewers are not required to consider such supplementary material.  
 Submissions exceeding the page limits or improperly formatted will be rejected without review.  
 (For SAT fast track submissions, the abstract and paper submission deadlines are respectively, May 1  May 2 and May 17, 2023).  
 All papers will go through a double-blind reviewing process, meaning that authors and reviewers are anonymous to each other. For this reason, submitted papers should not contain author names, affiliations, or links to identifying websites. References to own papers should be cited in such a way so as not to reveal the authorship of the paper.  
 A given paper must be submitted to one track only. When necessary, the Program Chair may move a submission to another, more suitable track.  
 Submitted papers must not appear in, be accepted for, or be under review for another peer-reviewed conference (with archived conference proceedings) or journal. Submissions that have appeared at workshops or other meetings and have not been formally published or have appeared only in highly shortened form (e.g., abstracts) can be submitted as papers.  
 Proceedings  
 Accepted papers (in all tracks) will appear in conference proceedings published by LIPIcs. A preliminary proceedings will be available at the time of the conference with the final version afterwards (after the publication approval process with paper authors and LIPIcs).  
 Other Information  
 Questions about the paper submission process may be addressed to the Program Chair, Roland Yap ( cp2023@easychair.org  ).
