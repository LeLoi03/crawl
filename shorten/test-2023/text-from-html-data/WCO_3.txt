 Recent Advances in Computational Optimization: Results of the Workshop on Computational Optimization WCO 2023  
 ★  ★  ★  ★  ★    
 Our everyday life is unthinkable without optimization. We try to minimize our effort and maximize the achieved profit.  
 Many real-world and industrial problems arising in engineering, economics, medicine, and other domains can be formulated as optimization tasks.  
 The book is a comprehensive collection of extended contributions from the Workshops on Computational Optimization 2023.  
 It shows how to develop algorithms for them based on new intelligent methods like evolutionary computations, ant colony optimization, constrain programming Monte Carlo method, and others. This research demonstrates how some real-world problems arising in engineering, economics, and other domains can be formulated as optimization problems.
