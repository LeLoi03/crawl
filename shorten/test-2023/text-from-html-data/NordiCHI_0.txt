  Mailing List:  
 To receive news and updates about events and jobs in the Nordic region join  the NordiCHI mailing list.  
 The list is intended for posting of announcements about, or related to, the biannual Nordic conference on human-computer interaction, NordiCHI. The current posting policy is that postings related to NordiCHI, or other academic events in the Nordic countries related broadly to HCI, are accepted. In addition postings about events outside the Nordic countries may be accepted if theme and organizers are related to the NordiCHI traditions and have a clear Nordic flavor.  
 Relevant job openings in the Nordic countries are also accepted, as the former jobs mailinglist has been merged into the announcements list. |  
 The NordiCHI website is supported and hosted by Aarhus University.
