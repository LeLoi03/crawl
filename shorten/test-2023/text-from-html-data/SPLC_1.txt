 About The SPLC  
 The Systems and Software Product Line Conference (SPLC) provides a forum for practitioners, researchers and educators to present and discuss the most recent ideas, innovations, trends, experiences, and concerns in systems and software product lines and systems and software product family engineering. Conference events include opportunities to hear industry leaders’ real-world experiences and researchers’ latest ideas, and to learn from both.
