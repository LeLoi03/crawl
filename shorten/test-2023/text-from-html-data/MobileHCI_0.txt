  Conference Theme  
 The conference theme in 2023 is "Beyond morality: Ethics and action in MobileHCI". Ethics are our deliberate effort to find answers to the questions of identifying good actions and choices. Focusing on deliberate action, we'd like to encourage authors to bravely move from following inherited, learned or handed-down rules that define good actions and choices (e.g. from legislation, professional practice, tradition, cultural and social norms and customs, etc) and to reflect on how their work addresses design, implementation and implications from a normative ethics viewpoint, such as virtue-based, deontological or utilitarian - consequentialist approaches. We invite all authors to especially consider and discuss ethical aspects in their work, as part of their problem definitions, system design, experiment design, instrument and metric adoption and conclusions and generalisations of research findings.
