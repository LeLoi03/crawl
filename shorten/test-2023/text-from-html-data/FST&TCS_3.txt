  Abstract    
 Timed languages contain sequences of discrete events ("letters") separated by real-valued delays, they can be recognized by timed automata, and represent behaviors of various real-time systems. The notion of bandwidth of a timed language defined in [Jacobo Inclán et al., 2022] characterizes the amount of information per time unit, encoded in words of the language observed with some precision ε. In this paper, we identify three classes of timed automata according to the asymptotics of the bandwidth of their languages with respect to this precision ε: automata are either meager, with an O(1) bandwidth, normal, with a Θ(log(1/ε)) bandwidth, or obese, with Θ(1/ε) bandwidth. We define two structural criteria and prove that they partition timed automata into these 3 classes of bandwidth, implying that there are no intermediate asymptotic classes. The classification problem of a timed automaton is PSPACE-complete. Both criteria are formulated using morphisms from paths of the timed automaton to some finite monoids extending Puri’s orbit graphs; the proofs are based on Simon’s factorization forest theorem.

  Abstract    
 The fundamental task of rank aggregation is to combine multiple rankings on a group of candidates into a single ranking to mitigate biases inherent in individual input rankings. This task has a myriad of applications, such as in social choice theory, collaborative filtering, web search, statistics, databases, sports, and admission systems. One popular version of this task, maximum rank aggregation (or the center ranking problem), aims to find a ranking (not necessarily from the input set) that minimizes the maximum distance to the input rankings. However, even for four input rankings, this problem is NP-hard (Dwork et al., WWW'01, and Biedl et al., Discrete Math.'09), and only a (folklore) polynomial-time 2-approximation algorithm is known for finding an optimal aggregate ranking under the commonly used Kendall-tau distance metric. Achieving a better approximation factor in polynomial time, ideally, a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS), is one of the major challenges. This paper presents significant progress in solving this problem by considering the Mallows model, a classical probabilistic model. Our proposed algorithm outputs an (1+ε)-approximate aggregate ranking for any ε > 0, with high probability, as long as the input rankings come from a Mallows model, even in a streaming fashion. Furthermore, the same approximation guarantee is achieved even in the presence of outliers, presumably a more challenging task.

  Abstract    
 Lately, the model of (Decision) Stochastic Timed Automata (DSTA) has been proposed, to model those Cyber Physical Systems displaying dense time (physical part), discrete actions and discontinuities such as timeouts (cyber part). The state of the art results on controlling DSTAs are however not ideal: in the case of infinite horizon, optimal controllers do not exist, while for timed bounded behaviors, we do not know how to build such controllers, even ε-optimal ones. In this paper, we develop a theory of Reinforcement Planning in the setting of DSTAs, for discounted infinite horizon objectives. We show that optimal controllers do exist in general. Further, for DSTAs with 1 clock (which already generalize Continuous Time MDPs with e.g. timeouts), we provide an effective procedure to compute ε-optimal controllers. It is worth noting that we do not rely on the discretization of the time space, but consider symbolic representations instead. Evaluation on a DSTA shows that this method can be more efficient. Last, we show on a counterexample that this is the furthest this construction can go, as it cannot be extended to 2 or more clocks.

  Abstract    
 In this paper we propose two new subclasses of Petri nets with resets, for which the reachability and coverability problems become tractable. Namely, we add an acyclicity condition that only applies to the consumptions and productions, not the resets. The first class is acyclic Petri nets with resets, and we show that coverability is PSPACE-complete for them. This contrasts the known Ackermann-hardness for coverability in (not necessarily acyclic) Petri nets with resets. We prove that the reachability problem remains undecidable for acyclic Petri nets with resets. The second class concerns workflow nets, a practically motivated and natural subclass of Petri nets. Here, we show that both coverability and reachability in acyclic workflow nets with resets are PSPACE-complete. Without the acyclicity condition, reachability and coverability in workflow nets with resets are known to be equally hard as for Petri nets with resets, that being Ackermann-hard and undecidable, respectively.

  Abstract    
 Linear Recurrence Sequences (LRS) are a fundamental mathematical primitive for a plethora of applications such as the verification of probabilistic systems, model checking, computational biology, and economics. Positivity (are all terms of the given LRS non-negative?) and Ultimate Positivity (are all but finitely many terms of the given LRS non-negative?) are important open number-theoretic decision problems. Recently, the robust versions of these problems, that ask whether the LRS is (Ultimately) Positive despite small perturbations to its initialisation, have gained attention as a means to model the imprecision that arises in practical settings. However, the state of the art is ill-equipped to reason about imprecision when its extent is explicitly specified. In this paper, we consider Robust Positivity and Ultimate Positivity problems where the neighbourhood of the initialisation, expressed in a natural and general format, is also part of the input. We contribute by proving sharp decidability results: decision procedures at orders our techniques are unable to handle for general LRS would entail significant number-theoretic breakthroughs.

  Abstract    
 Rational relations on words form a well-studied and often applied notion. While the definition in trace monoids is immediate, they have not been studied in this more general context. A possible reason is that they do not share the main useful properties of rational relations on words. To overcome this unfortunate limitation, this paper proposes a restricted class of rational relations, investigates its properties, and applies the findings to systems equipped with a pushdown that does not hold a word but a trace.

  Abstract    
 We study the fine-grained complexity of listing all 4-cycles in a graph on n nodes, m edges, and t such 4-cycles. The main result is an Õ(min(n²,m^{4/3})+t) upper bound, which is best-possible up to log factors unless the long-standing O(min(n²,m^{4/3})) upper bound for detecting a 4-cycle can be broken. Moreover, it almost-matches recent 3-SUM-based lower bounds for the problem by Abboud, Bringmann, and Fischer (STOC 2023) and independently by Jin and Xu (STOC 2023). Notably, our result separates 4-cycle listing from the closely related triangle listing for which higher conditional lower bounds exist, and rule out such a "detection plus t" bound. We also show by simple arguments that our bound cannot be extended to mild generalizations of the problem such as reporting all pairs of nodes that participate in a 4-cycle. [Independent work: Jin and Xu [Ce Jin and Yinzhan Xu, 2023] also present an algorithm with the same time bound.]

  Abstract    
 Each language L ⊆ Σ^* induces an infinite sequence Pr(L,n)_{n=1}^∞, where for all n ≥ 1, the value Pr(L,n) ∈ [0,1] is the probability of a word of length n to be in L, assuming a uniform distribution on the letters in Σ. Previous studies of Pr(L,n)_{n=1}^∞ for a regular language L, concerned zero-one laws, density, and accumulation points. We study monotonicity of Pr(L,n)_{n=1}^∞, possibly in the limit. We show that monotonicity may depend on the distribution of letters, study how operations on languages affect monotonicity, and characterize classes of languages for which the sequence is monotonic. We extend the study to languages L of infinite words, where we study the probability of lasso-shaped words to be in L and consider two definitions for Pr(L,n). The first refers to the probability of prefixes of length n to be extended to words in L, and the second to the probability of word w of length n to be such that w^ω is in L. Thus, in the second definition, monotonicity depends not only on the length of w, but also on the words being periodic.

  Abstract    
 This paper discusses the problem of efficiently solving parity games where player Odd has to obey an additional strong transition fairness constraint on its vertices - given that a player Odd vertex v is visited infinitely often, a particular subset of the outgoing edges (called live edges) of v has to be taken infinitely often. Such games, which we call Odd-fair parity games, naturally arise from abstractions of cyber-physical systems for planning and control. In this paper, we present a new Zielonka-type algorithm for solving Odd-fair parity games. This algorithm not only shares the same worst-case time complexity as Zielonka’s algorithm for (normal) parity games but also preserves the algorithmic advantage Zielonka’s algorithm possesses over other parity solvers with exponential time complexity. We additionally introduce a formalization of Odd player winning strategies in such games, which were unexplored previous to this work. This formalization serves dual purposes: firstly, it enables us to prove our Zielonka-type algorithm; secondly, it stands as a noteworthy contribution in its own right, augmenting our understanding of additional fairness assumptions in two-player games.

  Abstract    
 In Quantified Boolean Formulas QBFs, dependency schemes help to detect spurious or superfluous dependencies that are implied by the variable ordering in the quantifier prefix but are not essential for constructing countermodels. This detection can provably shorten refutations in specific proof systems, and is expected to speed up runs of QBF solvers. The proof system QCDCL recently defined by Beyersdorff and Böhm (LMCS 2023) abstracts the reasoning employed by QBF solvers based on conflict-driven clause-learning (CDCL) techniques. We show how to incorporate the use of dependency schemes into this proof system, either in a preprocessing phase, or in the propagations and clause learning, or both. We then show that when the reflexive resolution path dependency scheme 𝙳^rrs is used, a mixed picture emerges: the proof systems that add 𝙳^rrs to QCDCL in these three ways are not only incomparable with each other, but are also incomparable with the basic QCDCL proof system that does not use 𝙳^rrs at all, as well as with several other resolution-based QBF proof systems. A notable fact is that all our separations are achieved through QBFs with bounded quantifier alternation.

  Abstract    
 Extensions of Girard’s linear logic by least and greatest fixed point operators (μMALL) have been an active field of research for almost two decades. Various proof systems are known viz. finitary and non-wellfounded, based on explicit and implicit (co)induction respectively. In this paper, we compare the relative expressivity, at the level of provability, of two complementary infinitary proof systems: finitely branching non-wellfounded proofs (μMALL^∞) vs. infinitely branching well-founded proofs (μMALL_{ω,∞}). Our main result is that μMALL^∞ is strictly contained in μMALL_{ω,∞}. For inclusion, we devise a novel technique involving infinitary rewriting of non-wellfounded proofs that yields a wellfounded proof in the limit. For strictness of the inclusion, we improve previously known lower bounds on μMALL^∞ provability from Π⁰₁-hard to Σ¹₁-hard, by encoding a sort of Büchi condition for Minsky machines.
