 Tracks and Special Sessions   
 Besides the  Main Track   , ICLP 2023 will host additional tracks:   
 Applications Track    : this track invites submissions of papers on emerging and deployed applications of LP, describing all aspects of the development, deployment, and evaluation of logic programming systems to solve real-world problems, including interesting case studies and benchmarks, and discussing lessons learned.   
 Thematic Tracks    : ICLP 2023 will feature two thematic tracks inviting submissions that explore specific roles and potential for logic programming. The two thematic tracks are:   
 Logic Programming and Machine Learning 
  Logic Programming and  Explainability, Ethics, and Trustworthiness 
 Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF) Sessions    : these are meant to provide an inclusive environment for colleagues with similar interests to meet for informal discussion. Proposers of BoF sessions should serve as discussion leaders only. BoFs are not intended to be presentations.   
 Submission Details   
 We note that papers accepted at ICLP may appear either in   
 Theory and Practice of Logic Programming Journal (TPLP), or 
  Technical Communication Proceeding (TC) published by Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS) 
  All accepted papers will be presented during the conference. Authors of accepted papers will, by default, be automatically included in the list of ALP members, who will receive quarterly updates from the Logic Programming Newsletter at no cost.   
 All submissions must be written in English.
