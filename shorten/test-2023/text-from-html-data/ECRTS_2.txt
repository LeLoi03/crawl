 Real-time systems 
  Organization 
  Real-time systems  
 ECRTS promotes state-of-the-art research for applications with temporal constraints, time-sensitive, real-time systems. Such computing systems have to provide results that are not only correct in value but also delivered at the right time. Instead of average behavior as for standard computing, real-time systems have to allow for guarantees that temporal requirements will be met.  
 Quality  
 ECRTS is the premier European venue for presenting research into the broad area of real-time systems. Along with IEEE RTSS and IEEE RTAS, ECRTS ranks as one of the three top international conferences on this topic. Google Scholar Metrics  lists ECRTS as top conference per h5-index, CAPES (Brasil) as A1  .  
 Innovation  
 ECRTS has been at the forefront of recent innovations in the real-time community such as Work-in-Progress Poster sessions, Call for Actions, Artifact Evaluation, Industrial Challenges, Open-Access proceedings, etc., in the larger real-time computing community.  
 Open access  
 We believe that the conference serves the research community and the public best when results are accessible to the largest audience without restrictions, in particular not behind paywalls.  
 We also believe that the dissemination of results should not be restricted by the financial situation of authors, e.g. when substantial sums are required by for-profit publishers for “open access”.  
 Conference fees cover publication costs, which include the cost of keeping proceedings open access.  
 Organization  
 The Technical Committee is responsible for selecting locations and organizers for ECRTS.  
 Program Chairs  are responsible for the technical program of the main conference. They are selected based on their technical achievements, standing in the community, and organizational abilities. They select Program Committee  members, who review submitted papers and, together with the Program Chair, select papers for the program of the main conference, based on their scientific quality only in a face-to-face meeting. Program chairs serve only once.  
 General Chairs  are responsible for the logistical aspects of holding the conference, such as venue, facilities for communication, networking, and community building, including financial aspects.  
 ECRTS is complemented by a series of satellite workshops, which provide lively forums for discussion and interactions on various technical topics. They complement the main conference by providing short turnaround time for contributions, enabling exchange and discussions of new ideas in their areas, and establishing communities on specific topics.  
 Workshop chairs  are responsible for proposing new or organizing the technical aspects of specific workshops, with an emphasis on novelty and innovative concepts for interaction.
