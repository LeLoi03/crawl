  MW01: The robotics and neuroscience of supernumerary limbs  
  Tanmay Shankar, Carnegie Mellon University 
  Abstract:  
 There is a growing interest in the research and development of AI algorithms capable of generating explanations for their output. Explanations could play an essential role in robot systems to improve predictability, user-friendliness, debugging effectiveness, and overall transparency and trustworthiness of robots. This workshop aims to put forth a diversity of viewpoints from experts in robotics, from AI and technical to social perspectives. The workshop will provide a venue for robotics and AI researchers, philosophers, psychologists, and social scientists to exchange research, ideas, and opinions on the use of explanations in robotics, from methods and requirements to metrics, interaction, and qualitative findings. In this workshop, we aim to bring together researchers to explore 1) how HRI researchers seek to design human-interpretable or legible robot behaviors, 2) how xAI researchers have applied their techniques to robotics, 3) how robotics researchers generate explanations that allow robots to operate at different levels of autonomy, and 4) how roboticists have needed to augment or develop their own xAI techniques especially suited for robotics (xAI for "agents" may not be good for "robots”).  
 The topics that are relevant to this workshop include, but are not limited to: explainable AI algorithms for robotics; explainable decision making; ethical use of robotics; explainable motion planning; user studies for evaluation of explanations; social human-robot interaction; transparency and explainability in AI; benchmarks use cases for robotic explainability.

  Abstract:  
 Origami has undergone several revolutions: the development of a novel visual language in the art of paper folding in the 20th century, that of a mathematical language for modeling 3-D folding and recently, that of self-folding mechanical structures. The design of origami-based structures has indeed entered a new era when micro-actuators such as electro-active polymers (EAP), and shape-memory alloys (SMA) or polymers (SMP) were introduced to make structures self-deployable or to enable them to change their shapes dynamically, for example by combining elastic bands and tendon. In a recent focus published in Science Robotics, Rus and Sung predict that origami robots will be autonomous machines with increased customizability and adaptability. The versatility and diversity of folding structures can lead to the development of cutting-edge innovations by combining them with micro-actuators.

  Abstract:  
 Autonomous robots often need to operate with and around humans, to provide added value to the collaborative team, to earn-and-prove trustworthiness, as well as to utilize the support from the human team-mates. The presence of humans brings additional challenges for robot decision-making, but also opportunities for improving the decision-making capabilities with human help. Two major computational paradigms for sequential decision-making are planning and learning.  
 Planning in multi-stage robotic problems is not trivial, mainly due to computational efficiency (due to the curse of dimensionality) and the need for accurate models. To plan more efficiently, researchers use hierarchical abstractions (e.g. Task and Motion Planning - TAMP). Representing the problem as TAMP enables to incorporate declarative knowledge and to achieve predictable and interpretable behavior. However, creating declarative models requires significant engineering effort and it is practically impossible to account in advance for all possible cases robots might face in the long-term operations in the wild. Therefore, life-long learning presents itself as a necessity and human help as a dependable source of knowledge!  
 Learning methods achieved impressive capabilities, solely by improving performance based on the experience (e.g. trial-and-error, human demonstrations, corrections, etc.). However, they generally struggle with the long-term consequences of actions and the problems with the combinatorial structure. They can sometimes give solutions which are contradicting “common sense”, ignore causal effects, and forget previously learned skills (e.g. catastrophic forgetting). These issues are particularly prominent when it comes to life-long learning. Some of these issues might be avoided by using deliberate long-horizon reasoning (e.g. planning methods) and explicit human help.  
 Recently, a lot of research interest was shown in combined approaches utilizing synergies of planning and learning (e.g. neuro-symbolic AI). But still, principled integration of human input into these combined approaches is missing. Human input can play an important role in bridging planning and learning and enable reliable and trustworthy life-long learning with human help. It can be used for grounding learned models, providing “common sense” knowledge, teaching skills, setting goals, etc.

  Abstract:  
 Recent advances in robotics have allowed the introduction of robots assisting and working together with human subjects. To promote their use and widespread adoption, social acceptance of robots should be ensured. Social acceptance can be defined as the capability of a technology to be used in diverse social contexts (such as a postal office or a rehabilitation institute) in such a way that it does not make users feel uncomfortable or out of place following the norms of human social communication, while assisting them effectively.  
  The aim of this workshop is to bring together roboticists from academia as well as from industry to share their latest developments and vision on socially acceptable robots. To this end, we have identified four main pathways for enhancing social acceptance in the design of next generation robotic systems: user profiling, modeling and understanding, interaction and communication modalities, implementation of socially acceptable behaviors, and characterization of relevant application scenarios.

  MW15: Robot-Assisted Medical Imaging. ICRA-RAMI  
 Organisers:  
  Nassir Navab (nassir.navab@tum.de) Technical University of Munich, Germany 
  Abstract:  
 Medical imaging plays a vital role in modern clinical practice, which provides valuable information to physicians for medical diagnosis, image-guided surgeries, etc. The use of a robot acquires images and enables the controlled trajectory of the imaging system with high precision and reproducibility. Due to the boom of machine learning, the development of autonomous imaging systems gained increasing attention recently. To develop intelligent systems that robustly work in unknown environments, fundamental research continues to emerge, investigating novel approaches of visual seroving, share-control, object segmentation, scene understanding, and learning from experts' experiences.  
 The aim of this workshop is to bring together active research groups and clinicians, sharing the latest technological achievements in the field of robot-assisted medical imaging. By gathering world-class technical and clinical researchers, the meaningful discussion on the remaining challenges beyond technical developments like ethical issues and clinical acceptance will also be discussed during the one-day workshop.

  MW18: ICRA 2023 Workshop on Multi-Robot Learning  
 Organisers:  
  Vittorio Caggiano 
  Abstract:  
 The ICRA 2023 motto is “Embracing the future – Making robots for humans” but Building robots for humans (exoskeleton, prosthesis or cobot) is complex as the neuromusculoskeletal system is able to elaborate dexterous movements and interact with complicated environments with ease.  
 Synthesis of such diverse behaviours in humans requires effective coordination between the central nervous system – where intelligent controllers are created by networks of billions of neurons – and the peripheral musculoskeletal system which translates the intentions into actions. Akin to the central nervous system, the field of Artificial Intelligence has been pursuing the emulation of intelligent behaviours via neural structures (Neural Networks). At the same time, and mostly independently, the biomechanics community has been developing in silico musculoskeletal model to understand peripheral actuation.  
 These new developments offer new avenues to better understand how movement is generated through these complex pathways in silico and how machines could seamlessly be integrated with it.

  Abstract:  
 Our joint ICRA 2023 Workshop on Multidisciplinary Approaches to Co-Creating Trustworthy Autonomous Systems will bring together academics and industry practitioners from a wide range of disciplines and backgrounds (including robotics, engineering, AI, computer science, social science, humanities, design, and law). We will organise a workshop which will be open and welcoming to researchers from the autonomous agents and multi-agent systems community.  
 Defining autonomous systems as systems involving software applications, machines, and people, which are able to take actions with little or no human supervision, the workshop will explore different definitions of TAS and individual aspects of trust from a multidisciplinary perspective.

  FW01: Workshop on Robot Execution Failures and Failure Management Strategies  
 An important aspect of autonomous robot behaviour is the ability to recognise failures and take steps to correct those, both during online operation (so that the ongoing activity can be continued) and over long-term deployment (so that failures are not constantly repeated). Failure awareness is important in different contexts: to prevent the propagation of failures in autonomous operation (particularly for mobile manipulators) and thus avoid downtime as much as possible without requiring constant human intervention, to enable a robot to communicate its failures to users and thus be more trustworthy, or to guide learning so that scenarios that lead to failures can be avoided.  
  This workshop provides a forum for discussing robot execution failures, strategies for failure modelling, avoidance, and analysis, as well as techniques for learning from failures. A combination of invited talks, paper presentations, and interactive sessions will provide participants with an opportunity to analyse failure management strategies in different robot applications and to discuss open challenges for dealing with robot execution failures in order to make autonomous robots more reliable and suitable for use in human-centered applications.

  Abstract:  
 The capability to grasp and manipulate objects allows people to interact with their surrounding environment, and is key in daily working and social activities. Assistive technologies such as wheelchair-mounted robotic arms, prostheses, and supernumerary limbs have already shown their capability in providing more independence to people lacking manipulation skills due to an innate or acquired upper-limb motor disability. This workshop aims at connecting developers, distributors, and end-users of assistive robots with expert researchers in the field of robotic manipulation to discuss how new and advanced grasp planning and control algorithms (e.g., techniques for grasping deformable objects), as well as new design paradigms for robotic hands (e.g., soft/smart materials, innovative sensing/actuation systems), have already been, or have the potential to be, adopted in assistive applications. A special focus will also be the analysis of guidelines and best practices for a user-centric design, development and transfer of new approaches in the field from the research labs to the assistive world. For the transfer to be successful, not only the robotic solutions should work effectively and reliably, but they should, above all, be accepted by the end-users and the society.

  Abstract:  
 The scope and goal of the proposed workshop is to focus on geometric algebra, differential geometry, and related methods and applications of geometric tools to robotics. Although the theoretical origins of these tools can be traced back to Descartes’s introduction of coordinated systems, Ball’s designs of screws motion, and Clifford’s and Study’s studies (pun intended), contemporary applications have changed drastically. Indeed, screw theory along with its multifarious manifestations such as Plücker coordinates and unit dual quaternions, coupled with Riemannian geometry and Lie algebra, have re-emerged and become fundamental in the shaping and formalization of the latest problems in robot mechanics, multi-body dynamics, mechanical design, robot control, optimization and robot learning.  
 The overall theme of the workshop is aligned with multiple fields of robotics research and aims to build a roadmap towards a sound and unified theoretical basis for addressing elaborated robotics problems, scaling and leveraging data-driven methods from Euclidean domains to proper geometric groups, and improving overall human-robot co-existence through geometric methods and tools. Furthermore, recent studies which will be presented by selected keynote speakers have shown that the exploitation of geometric properties within Lie groups and Riemannian manifolds has led to better exploration of the human-environment. The results to be presented in this event as well as the theoretical machinery plays an important role in making robots that can operate around humans (ICRA 2023 theme).  
 In this context, the main objective of this full-day workshop is to stimulate and revisit the latest developments and applications concerning algebraic and differential geometry concepts, and to understand how models, algorithms and data-driven methods initially developed for Euclidean spaces can be further extended to special geometric groups. We also expect this workshop to be instrumental in inspiring the junior researchers in the community to understand and include these fundamental geometrical concepts, paving the foundation for new applications, and reinforcing the cross-pollination and exchange of ideas between stakeholders, researchers and practitioners within our increasingly thriving community.

  Abstract:  
 Deploying robots and other autonomous systems on a large scale requires that both its designers and the general public trust that they behave as intended. Establishing this trust requires being able to certify properties and behaviors of robots — including both traditional attributes in robotics like safety or robustness and emerging concepts like fairness and privacy — at scale and across a wide range of operating environments. How can we validate that robots are operating safely in the real, uncertain, and interactive world?  
 There are many state-of-the-art approaches working towards answering this question, including reachability analysis, rare-event simulation, fault detection, risk-aware decision making, and others. These tools are beginning to make the transition from proof of concept to scalable solutions. The goal of this workshop is to foster communication between academic researchers, industry entities, and regulatory agencies on the topic of large-scale verification and deployment of robots in real-world applications. The program will expose academic researchers to the problems and workflows used in industry, and industry professionals and regulatory agencies to emerging theoretical and practical tools from academia. Our hope is that such a dialogue will accelerate the safe and widespread deployment of robotic systems in the long term.

  Abstract:  
 Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) involves performing delicate operations on anatomical structures through small incisions or natural orifices along tortuous paths inside the human body. Thus, such operations give rise to constraints in accessing and operation and further technical challenges. These demand the development trends to be diverted from straight and rigid operational arms to flexible and continuum manipulators, which support broad applications with minimal trauma and facilitate the demanding clinical procedures with miniaturized instrumentation and highly curvilinear access capabilities. However, the lack of sufficient force and shape sensing/estimation techniques poses great challenges to precise and reliable motion/force control of continuum manipulators, resulting in risks for patients. Developing force and shape sensing, estimation, and display (e.g., haptic/tactile feedback interfaces) techniques is crucial for safe clinical procedures. New results and breakthroughs towards these challenges can encourage the advances in closely associated techniques of closed-loop control, path planning, surgeon–robot interaction, and safety concerns in MIS.  
 This workshop will bring both leading engineering and clinical experts to discuss the associated clinical needs, engineering challenges, and recent progress in the field. The results of this workshop will be to identify a list of potential techniques as well as a list of technical and clinical challenges to be resolved. A white paper based on these results will be developed and submitted to a relevant journal, e.g., Endoscopy, or Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery. A Special Issue call will also be arranged.

  Abstract:  
 Perception, which involves organization, identification, and interpretation of sensory streams, has been a long-standing problem in robotics, and has been rapidly promoted by modern deep learning techniques. Traditional research in this field generally lies in single-robot scenarios, such as object detection, tracking, and semantic/panoptic segmentation. However, single-robot perception suffers from long-range and occlusion issues due to the limited sensing capability and dense traffic situations, and the imperfect perception could severely degrade the later planning and control modules.  
 Collaborative perception has been proposed to fundamentally solve the aforementioned problem, yet it is still faced with challenges including lack of real-world dataset, extra computational burden, high communication bandwidth, and subpar performance in adversarial scenarios. To tackle these challenging issues and to promote more research in collaborative perception and learning, this workshop aims to stimulate discussion on techniques that will enable better multi-agent autonomous systems with an emphasis on robust collaborative perception and learning methods, perception-based multi-robot planning and control, cooperative and competitive multi-agent systems, and safety-critical connected autonomous driving.  
 In line with the ICRA 2023 Making Robots for Humans theme, this workshop will provide a venue for academics and industry practitioners to create a vision for connected robots to promote the safety and intelligence for humans. The half-day workshop will feature presentations by distinguished speakers as well as interactive activities in the form of poster sessions and panel discussions.

  Telepresence through avatars is a relevant and topical area in robotics research because avatars represent a next generation of telecommuting devices that enable workers to not only communicate through audio and video, but also navigate remotely and manipulate objects in the distant environment. The process of developing a robotic avatar touches on many areas of robotics research, including telerobotics, haptics, tactile sensing, robot hands, VR/AR, and human robot-interaction.  
  In November 2022, 17 teams from ten countries competed in the ANA Avatar XPRIZE Finals. The workshop is an opportune time for XPRIZE teams, observers, and researchers in related areas to discuss and reflect on their perspectives on the current state of avatar technology, as well as future research challenges in the areas of telerobotics, haptics, VR/AR, and human-robot interaction. The program will consist of invited presentations, contributed talks and demos, and a panel discussion.

  Abstract:  
 There is an increasing number of analytical and numerical modelling approaches and frameworks for soft robotic manipulators emerging. Some of these modelling techniques offer design optimisation with regards to application-driven requirements, a thorough kinematic, stiffness, force analysis of the system, or an evaluation of a control strategy, to name a few. These mathematical tools in combination with experimental evaluation test rigs can be extremely powerful tools to gain detailed understanding of a soft robotic system.  
 The tutorial aims to bring together experts active in the field of creating modelling approaches for soft robotic systems, early-career researchers who have developed a keen interest in soft robotics and software industry. This full-day event will provide a platform to researchers, who have created soft robotic toolboxes and experimental test rigs,  
 (i) to give hands-on tutorial sessions,  
 (ii) to explore requirements for a joint, soft robotic toolbox together with the soft robotic community,
