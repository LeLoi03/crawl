 The Web Conference  
 The Web Conference (formerly WWW conference) is a yearly international conference on the topic of the future directions of the World Wide Web.  
 The Conference aims to provide the world with a premier forum for discussion and debate about the evolution of the Web, the standardization of its associated technologies, and the impact of those technologies on society and culture. The conference brings together researchers, developers, users and commercial ventures â€” indeed all those who are passionate about the Web and what it has to offer.
