   FM 2023: 25th International Symposium on Formal Methods - Call for Papers   
 Lübeck, Germany, 6-10 March 2023  
  FM 2023 is the 25th international symposium in a series organized by Formal Methods Europe (FME), an independent association whose aim is to stimulate the use of, and research on, formal methods for software development. FME has a Memorandum of Understanding with the ERCIM Working Group on Formal Methods for Industrial Critical Systems (FMICS) to collaborate in holding an annual joint industry-focussed event. This Industry Day (I-Day) at FM targets the industrial development and use of formal methods.  
 Topics   
  FM 2023 will highlight the development and application of formal methods in a wide range of domains including trustworthy AI, software, computer-based systems, systems-of-systems, cyber-physical systems, security, human-computer interaction, manufacturing, sustainability, energy, transport, smart cities, healthcare, and biology. It particularly welcomes papers on techniques, tools and experiences in interdisciplinary settings. It also welcomes papers on experiences of applying formal methods in industrial settings, and on the design and validation of formal method tools.  
 New this year! FM 2023 explicitly welcomes submissions to the special FM 2023 session on “Formal methods meets AI”, which is focused on formal and rigorous modelling and analysis techniques to ensuring safety, robustness etc. (trustworthiness) of AI-based systems.  
 Deadlines   
  The paper submission deadline is 11 September 2022, with an abstract due one week earlier. Accepted papers will be included in the Symposium Proceedings published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Extended versions of selected papers will be invited for publication in a special issue of a journal.  
 General Chair   
  Martin Leucker (University of Lübeck, Germany)
