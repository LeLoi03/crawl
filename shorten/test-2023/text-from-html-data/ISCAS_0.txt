 About IEEE ISCAS 2023  
 The IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS) is the flagship conference of the IEEE Circuits and Systems (CAS) Society and the world’s premiere forum for researchers in the active fields of theory, design and implementation of circuits and systems. This is accomplished through technical conference sessions, poster sessions, live demonstration sessions, and publication of conference papers. ISCAS 2023 will be driven by the theme “Technology Disruption and Society” aiming to emphasize the potential of the CAS Society to find innovative solutions to challenges facing society today.
