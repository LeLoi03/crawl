  Overview of PPDP 2023  
  PPDP aims to provide a forum that brings together researchers from the declarative programming communities, including those working in the logic, constraint and functional programming paradigms, but also embracing a variety of other paradigms such as visual programming, executable specification languages, database languages, AI languages and knowledge representation languages used, for example, in the semantic web.  
 The goal is to stimulate research in the use of logical formalisms and methods for specifying, performing, and analysing computations, including mechanisms for mobility, modularity, concurrency, object-orientation, security, and static analysis. Papers related to the use of declarative paradigms and tools in industry and education are especially solicited.  
 Scope  
  Tools and Applications: programming and proof environments; verification tools; case studies in proof assistants or interactive theorem provers; certification; novel applications of declarative programming inside and outside of CS; declarative programming pearls; practical experience reports and industrial application; education. 
  The PC chair will be happy to advise on the appropriateness of a topic.  
 PPDP 2023 will be held in Cascais, Lisbon, Portugal. Previous symposia were held at Tbilisi (Georgia)  , Tallinn (Estonia)  , Bologna (Italy)  , Porto (Portugal)  , Frankfurt am Main (Germany)  , Namur (Belgium)  , Edinburgh (UK)  , Siena (Italy)  , Canterbury (UK)  , Madrid (Spain)  , Leuven (Belgium)  , Odense (Denmark)  , Hagenberg (Austria)  , Coimbra (Portugal)  , Valencia (Spain)  , Wroclaw (Poland)  , Venice (Italy)  , Lisboa (Portugal)  , Verona (Italy)  , Uppsala (Sweden)  , Pittsburgh (USA)  , Florence (Italy)  , Montr√©al (Canada)  , and Paris (France)  .

  Submission Categories & Guidelines  
  Submission page is available via EasyChair  .  
  Selected papers will be invited to the Journal of Functional Programming (JFP) or the Journal of Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).  
  Submission Categories  
 Submissions can be made in three categories: regular Research Papers  , System Descriptions  , and Experience Reports  .  
 Submissions of Research Papers  must present original research which is unpublished and not submitted elsewhere. They must not exceed 12 pages ACM style 2-column (including figures, but excluding bibliography). Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally published workshop proceedings may be submitted (please contact the PC chair in case of questions). Research papers will be judged on originality, significance, correctness, clarity, and readability.  
 Submission of System Descriptions  must describe a working system whose description has not been published or submitted elsewhere. They must not exceed 10 pages and should contain a link to a working system. System Descriptions must be marked as such at the time of submission and will be judged on originality, significance usefulness, clarity, and readability.  
 Submissions of Experience Reports  are meant to help create a body of published, refereed, citable evidence where declarative programming such as functional, logic, answer-set, constraint programming, etc., is used in practice. They must not exceed 5 pages including references  . Experience Reports must be marked as such at the time of submission and need not report original research results. They will be judged on significance usefulness, clarity, and readability.  
 Possible topics for an Experience Report include, but are not limited to:  
 insights gained from real-world projects using declarative programming 
  novel use of declarative programming in the classroom 
  programming pearl that illustrates a nifty new data structure or programming technique. 
  Supplementary material may be provided via a link to an extended version of the submission (recommended), or in a clearly marked appendix beyond the above-mentioned page limits. Reviewers are not required to study extended versions or any material beyond the respective page limit. Material beyond the page limit will not be included in the final published version.  
 Format of a submission  
 Requirements for publication  
 At least one author of each accepted submission will be expected to attend and present the work at the conference. The pc chair may retract a paper that is not presented. The pc chair may also retract a paper if complaints about the paper's correctness are raised which cannot be resolved by the final paper deadline.  
 Review process  
 The reviewing is single-blind.
