 CAiSE FORUM  
 CAiSE’23 Forum: Call for papers and tool demonstrations   
 The CAiSE Forum is a space within the CAiSE conference for presenting and discussing new ideas and tools related to information systems engineering. Intended to serve as an interactive platform, the Forum aims to present emerging topics and controversial positions, and to demonstrate innovative systems, tools and applications. The Forum sessions at the CAiSE conference will facilitate the interaction, discussion, and exchange of ideas among presenters and participants. Contributions to the CAiSE’23 Forum are welcome to address any of the CAiSE’23 conference topics and, particularly, this year’s theme— Cyber-Human Systems  .  
 We invite two types of submissions:  
 Visionary papers | present innovative research projects, which are still at a relatively early stage and do not necessarily include a full-scale validation. Visionary papers will be presented as posters in the Forum. 
  Demo papers | describe innovative tools and prototypes that implement the results of research efforts. The tools and prototypes will be presented as demos in the Forum, accompanied by a poster. 
  Both visionary papers and demo papers must not exceed 8 pages in LNCS format.  
 See authors guidelines  . Papers should be submitted in PDF format through the conference management system available at EasyChair  .  
 The submitted papers must be unpublished and must not be under review elsewhere.  
 Publication and Presentations    
 Authors should consult Springer’s authors guidelines and use their LaTeX or Word proceedings templates for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs  in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.  
 It is expected that at least one of the authors attends CAiSE’23, presents the poster/delivers the demo and interacts with the Forum participants.
