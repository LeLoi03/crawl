 The 27th edition of EuroVis will take place in Luxembourg City, Luxembourg, and will be hosted by the Visualization and Interaction Group (VISINT) of the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST).   
 EuroVis is the premier annual conference organized by the Eurographics Working Group on Data Visualization  .  
 As a dynamic and rapidly evolving field, visualization plays a critical role in addressing one of todayâ€™s most pressing challenges: transforming vast amounts of raw data into meaningful insights. While data collection and storage capabilities have advanced exponentially, our capacity to derive actionable knowledge from this information lags behind. Visualization bridges this gap by utilizing the power of the human visual system, combined with advanced computer graphics, to offer intuitive exploration, analysis, and communication of complex data.
