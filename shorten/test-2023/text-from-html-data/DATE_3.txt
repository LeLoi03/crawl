 The DATE conference is the main European event bringing together designers and design automation users, researchers and vendors as well as specialists in the hardware and software design, test and manufacturing of electronic circuits and systems. DATE puts a strong emphasis on both technology and systems, covering ICs/SoCs, reconfigurable hardware and embedded systems as well as embedded software.  
 The three-day event consists of a conference with regular papers, late breaking results papers and extended abstracts, complemented by timely keynotes, special days, focus sessions, embedded tutorials, half-day workshops and multi-partner project sessions. The event will also host the Young People Programme and unplugged sessions fostering the networking and the exchange of information on relevant issues, recent research outcomes and career opportunities.  
 DATE 20 25   is the 28th edition of an event that has always been the place for researchers, young professionals and industrial partners to meet, present their research and discuss the current development and next trends, with high emphasis on social interaction.  
 At DATE 20 25   , the DATE community, again, comes together for the conference in an intensive three-day format, focussing on interaction as well as further strengthening the community. The vast majority of regular papers will be presented in technical sessions using short flash-presentations, where the emphasis is on poster-supported live interactions (in addition to the common full-length presentation videos available before, during and after the conference). By this, we continue to focus on the core value of conferences: meeting, discussing and exchanging.

 The Conference  
 The conference addresses all aspects of research into technologies for electronic and (embedded) systems engineering. It covers the design process, test and tools for design automation of electronic products ranging from integrated circuits to distributed large-scale systems. This includes both hardware and embedded software design issues. The conference scope also includes the elaboration of design requirements and new architectures for challenging application fields such as sustainable computing, smart societies and digital wellness, secure systems, autonomous systems and smart industry, and state of the art applications of artificial intelligence. Engineers, scientists and researchers involved in innovative industrial designs are particularly encouraged to submit papers to foster feedback from design to research.  
  Special Days on Emerging Topics  
 The scientific research track is complemented by a set of sessions focussing on emerging topics bringing new challenges to the community, with presentations and interactions on interesting and timely issues.  
  During the talks, AI/ML techniques such as Neural architecture search (NAS), Generative adversarial networks (GAN), Reinforcement learning, hybridisation of classical and AI techniques, federation of Small Language Models (or agents) will be discussed.  
 These topics will be presented by a lineup of distinguished speakers who are expert in their respective fields. The day will conclude with a panel discussion allowing exchanges with the audience and trigger discussions on the interaction between the various domains presented during the day.  
 This event is ideal for AI/ML researchers, data scientists, hardware designers, software developers, sustainability advocates, and anyone interested in the future directions of AI and ML for Design, Automation and Test.

  Special Initiative “Autonomous Systems Design”  
 Fueled by the progress of Artificial Intelligence, autonomous systems are increasingly becoming integral parts of many Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) applications, such as automated driving, robotics, avionics, industrial automation and smart systems in general. Autonomous systems are self-governed and self-adaptive systems that are designed to operate in an open and evolving environment, which is not completely defined at design time. This poses a unique challenge to the design and verification of dependable autonomous systems. The DATE Special Initiative on Autonomous Systems Design will include peer-reviewed papers, special sessions and interactive sessions addressing these challenges.

  Submission Instructions    
  Late Breaking Results  
 Following the successful edition in 2024, DATE 20 25   provides the community with an opportunity to present new and exciting contributions for submission as Late Breaking Results (LBR) papers. LBR papers should cover new research relevant to the DATE topics. Two types of papers can be submitted:  
 breakthrough approaches or novel orthogonal research directions 
  breakthrough results, where sufficient work has been accomplished to indicate the viability of the work 
  Prospective authors are invited to submit Late Breaking Results papers (2 pages and two-column format) describing original and innovative work. Authors should use the template provided on the DATE website, with a blind submission. LBR submission titles must begin with “Late Breaking Results: …”.  
 For creating a successful LBR forum, the LBR submission will be peer-reviewed (blind-review) by a wide-scope TPC committee. Please note that the Late Breaking Results deadline is not an extension of the general paper submission deadline. Accepted LBR submissions will be presented in dedicated technical sessions focussing on live interactions around the submitted work to get feedback and exchange with the DATE community.  
 Please note that the Late Breaking Results deadline is not an extension of the general paper submission deadline. It should also be noted that accepted Late Breaking Results papers will be published in the DATE proceedings as submitted and are expected to be camera-ready.
