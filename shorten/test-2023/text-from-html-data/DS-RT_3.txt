 *THE SYMPOSIUM*   
 The 2023 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications (DS-RT 2023) promises to be a grand affair and will take place in Singapore. DS-RT 2023 serves as a platform for simulationists from academia, industry and research labs to present recent research results in Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications.   
 DS-RT 2023 targets the growing overlap between large distributed simulations and real time applications, such as metaverse, collaborative virtual environments, pervasive and ubiquitous application scenarios, actuator systems and the usage of artificial intelligence techniques in both simulation and real-time applications.   
 The conference features prominent invited speakers as well as papers by top researchers in the field. DS-RT 2023 will include contributed technical papers, invited papers, and tutorials. The proceedings will be published by IEEE-CS press.   
 *CALL FOR PAPERS*   
  DS-RT provides an international forum for the discussion and presentation of original ideas, recent results and achievements by researchers, research students, and systems developers on issues and challenges related to distributed simulation and real time applications. Authors are encouraged to submit both theoretical and practical results of significance. Demonstration of new tools/applications is very encouraged.   
 The scope of the symposium includes, but is not limited to:   
 * Serious Gaming and Massive Multiplayer Online Games (MMOG) applications, architectures and scalability issues   
 * Visual Interactive Simulation Environments (e.g., Generic Animation, Visual Interactive Modelling, Interactive Computer Based Training and Learning, Scientific Visualization, High-End Computer Graphics)   
 * Design Issues, Interaction Designs, Human Computer Interaction Issues raised by Large Scale DS-RT Systems   
 * Media Convergence (e.g. New Technologies, Media Theory, Real-Time considerations of Multi Modality, etc.)   
 * Innovative Styles of Interactions with Large Scale DS-RT Systems (e.g. Implicit, Situative and Attentive Interaction, Tangible Interaction, Embedded Interaction, etc.)   
 * Technologies for Living Labs (e.g. Mirror World Simulation, Interoperability, Large Scale Multi Sensor Networks, Global Wireless Communication, Multi Stakeholder Understanding and Innovation)   
 * Environmental and Emerging Simulation Challenges (e.g. Growth of Human Population, Climate Change, CO2, Health Care, Ecosystems, Sustainable Development, Water and Energy Supply, Human Mobility, Air Traffic, World Stock Markets, Food Supply Chains, Megacities, Smart Cities, Disaster Planning, etc.)
