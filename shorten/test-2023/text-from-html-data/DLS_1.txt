 Call for Contributions  
 The Dynamic Languages Symposium (DLS) is the premier forum for researchers and practitioners to share research and experience on all aspects on dynamic languages.  
 After two decades of dynamic language research and DLS, it is time to reflect and look forward to what the next two decades will bring. This year’s DLS will therefore be a special DLS focusing on the Future of Dynamic Languages. To do the notion of “symposium” justice, we will actively invite speakers to present their opinions on where Dynamic Languages might be, will be, or should be going in the next twenty years.  
 Speakers will be announced step by step over the coming weeks.  
 As a research venue, we also invite high quality papers reporting original research and experience related to the design, implementation, and applications of dynamic languages. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:  
  semantics of dynamic languages 
  frameworks and languages for the Cloud and the IoT 
  Submission Details   
 Submissions must neither be previously published nor under review at other events. DLS 2023 uses a lightweight double-blind reviewing process.  
 Papers are assumed to be in one of the following categories:  
 Research Papers  : describe work that advances the current state of the art  
 Experience Papers  : describe insights gained from substantive practical applications that should be of a broad interest  
 Dynamic Pearls  : describe a known idea in an appealing way to remind the community and capture a reader’s interest  
 The program committee will evaluate each paper based on its relevance, significance, clarity, and originality. The paper category needs to be indicated during submission, and papers are judged accordingly.  
 Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format. Submissions must be in the ACM SIGPLAN conference acmart format, 10 point font, and should not exceed 12 pages. Please see full details in the Instructions for Authors.  
 DLS 2023 will run a single-phase reviewing process with shepherding to help authors make their final papers the best that they can be. Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library (TBC) and will be freely available for one month, starting two weeks before the event.
