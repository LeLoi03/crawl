 Welcome to ESORICS 2023!  
  Computer security is concerned with the protection of information in environments where there is a possibility of intrusion or malicious action. The aim of ESORICS is to further the progress of research and development in computer security by establishing a European community for bringing together academia and industry in this area. Progressively organized in a series of European countries, the symposium is confirmed as one of the biggest European conferences in computer security. Nowadays, the symposium has also explored the R&D directions on AI, machine learning, privacy-enhancing technology, network security, software, and hardware security, blockchain, smart contract, and real-world applied cryptography.
