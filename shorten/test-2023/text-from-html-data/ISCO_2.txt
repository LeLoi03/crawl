 CfP: ISCO 2022 – International Symposium on Combinatorial Optimization  
 2022-02-01    ~  patrickhirsch      
 ISCO (International Symposium on Combinatorial Optimization) is a biennial symposium whose aim is to bring together researchers from all the communities related to combinatorial optimization, including algorithms and complexity, mathematical programming, operations research, optimization under uncertainty, graphs and combinatorics. It is intended to be a forum for presenting original research in these areas and especially in their intersections. Quality papers on all aspects of combinatorial optimization, from mathematical foundations and theory of algorithms to computational studies and practical applications, are solicited.  
 ISCO 2022 will be held online (May 18-20, 2022) and will be preceded by a Spring School (May 16-17, 2022) given by Giacomo Nannicini on „Mathematical Optimization and Quantum Algorithms“  which is dedicated to PhD students but the lectures are also open to other colleagues.  
 SUBMISSIONS and PUBLICATIONS:  
  There are two types of submissions:  
  – Regular papers up to 12 pages. The post-conference proceedings will be published by Springer (LNCS series). For an accepted paper to be included in the proceedings, it should be presented at the conference by one of the authors. The authors of accepted papers will have to prepare their camera-ready version two weeks after the end of the conference. More information about the submission procedure will be available in the web site of the conference in due time.  
  – Extended abstracts up to 3 pages. Accepted abstracts will be published online on the conference website (and will not be included in the post-conference proceedings).  
 IMPORTANT DATES:  
  – Submission deadline: February 15, 2022 (regular papers) and March 31, 2022 (extended abstracts)
