 About CICM -----------  
 Digital and computational solutions are becoming the prevalent means for the generation, communication, processing, storage and curation of mathematical information.  
 CICM brings together the many separate communities that have developed theoretical and practical solutions for mathematical applications such as computation, deduction, knowledge management, and user interfaces. It offers a venue for discussing problems and solutions in each of these areas and their integration.  
 The scope of CICM concerns all topics relating to intelligent computer mathematics, in particular but not limited to  
 * theorem proving and computer algebra * mathematical knowledge management * digital mathematical libraries  
 Workshops affiliated to CICM 2023: ----------------------------------  
 * 31th OpenMath Workshop, organized by James Davenport and Michael Kohlhase, * 3rd Workshop on Natural Formal Mathematics (NatFoM 2023) organized by Peter Koepke, Adrian De Lon and Dennis Mueller (also an EuroProofNet workshop), * 14th Workshop on Mathematical User Interaction (MathUI 2023), organized by Abhishek Chugh and Andrea Kohlhase, * 6th Workshop on Formal Mathematics for Mathematicians (FMM 2023), organized by Karol Pak.  
 The EuroProofNet Workshop on Libraries of Formal Proofs and Natural Mathematical Language, organized by Angeliki Koutsoukou Argyraki and Claudio Sacerdoti Coen is co-located with CICM 2023.
