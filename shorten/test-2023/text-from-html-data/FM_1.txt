 FM: The Formal Methods Symposia  
 The Formal Methods Symposia  
 Partnership with Journals  
 FME has established partnerships with several prestigious formal methods journals. Through these partnerships, the FM symposia will include presentations of papers published in the journals in the program of the FM symposia. These presentations compose a Journal-First Track  . A dedicated Track Chair, with the help of a small committee, selects papers from the partnership journals and invite authors to present their work at FM. In this way, FME aims to strenghten the social side of our science, as lively discussion are central to scientific progress.  
 The partner journals that support the Journal-first track are:
