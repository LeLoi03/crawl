   DocEng'23  
 The 23 rd  ACM Symposium on Document Engineering (DocEng'23) seeks original research papers that focus on the design, implementation, development, management, use and evaluation of advanced systems where documents and document collections play a key role. DocEng emphasizes innovative approaches to document engineering technology, use of documents and document collections in real-world applications, and novel principles, tools and processes that improve our ability to create, manage, maintain, share, and productively use these.  
 In particular, DocEng'23 seeks contributions in the area of cooperative work with documents.  
 You are invited to submit original papers to DocEng'23, to be held in University of Limerick, Ireland. Attendees at this international forum have interests that span all aspects of document engineering and applications.  
 DocEng'23 is organised by the University of Limerick, Ireland as a full, in person event.  
 Keynote Speakers  
 We are delighted to announce two wonderful keynote speakers for DocEng'23:  
  Gary Moloney - The evolution and growth of engineering documents for consumer engagement  .  
 Product and service differentiation by virtue of delivering a unique personalized consumer experience is considered by many as the next competitive battleground. Due to the e-commerce sales surge during the pandemic more often these days the consumers first tangible interaction with the brand is now upon receipt of a package purchased online. Brands look at the consumer touchpoints with the brand, its packaging and labels, as more and more critical in delivering and managing an event-based-experience.  
 How you “engineer” your users to engage is the human factor/behavioral element of document engineering. This presentation will look at real-life examples of how brands are evolving their strategies when focussing on event based experiences to both deliver new brand marketing/consumer experience strategies and to create data sets from the consumer engagement to address both old-age business problems and challenges and some new emerging ones.  
 Gary  is a technology innovation centre manager, engineer, and experienced technology services executive. He has a proven track record of developing & leading award winning commercially successful cloud services rd&i in multinational corporate environments. Gary has 25+ years’ strong domain expertise and experience of building & managing technology teams in successfully delivering innovative technology-based services & solutions related to product & supply chain traceability, brand protection/counterfeit detection and prevention, brand promotion & consumer engagement.
