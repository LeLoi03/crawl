 Please Note  
 1. We expect at least one author of an accepted paper to attend the conference. The expectation of attendance is implicit in submitting a paper to a conference, rather than a journal, and brings ethical responsibilities to participate actively in the conference (talking to other attendees, presenting the paper, and attending conference sessions).  
  2. Consequently, it is expected that all accepted papers will be presented in person, unless clear and extenuating circumstances prevent attendance.  
  3. As an author of an accepted paper, this means you should exhaust all efforts to attend, including seeking a visa (where needed).  
  4. Any allowance for remote presentation will be considered only after clear evidence that attendance is impossible.  
  5. These decisions about remote presentation will be made two weeks before the conference begins.
