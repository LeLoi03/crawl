 The Symposium on Solid and Physical Modeling (SPM) is an international conference series organised annually with the support of the Solid Modeling Association (SMA). This conference is in-cooperation with the ACM Siggraph and the Eurographics Association. SPM'22 will be held as an online event on June 27-29, 2022. The conference aims at all aspects of geometric and physical modeling, and their application in design, analysis and manufacturing, as well as in biomedical, geophysical, digital entertainment, and other areas. The conference serves also as a ceremony for awarding the 2022 Pierre BÃ©zier Prize for contributions to solid, shape, and physical modeling.
