 VECoS  
 Verification and Evaluation  
  of Computer and Communication Systems  
  The International Conference on Verification and Evaluation of Computer and Communication Systems (VECoS) was created by an Euro-Med network of researchers in computer science. The aim of the VECoS conference is to bring together researchers and practitioners, in the areas of verification, control, performance, quality of service, dependability evaluation and assessment, in order to discuss the state-of-the-art and the challenges in modern computer and communication systems in which functional and non-functional properties are strongly interrelated. Thus, the main motivation for VECoS is to encourage the cross-fertilization between the various formal verification and evaluation approaches, methods and techniques, and especially those based on the specification formalisms for concurrent, distributed and software/hardware systems. Beyond its technical and scientific goals, another main purpose of VECoS is to promote collaboration between participants in research and education in the area of computer science and engineering.
