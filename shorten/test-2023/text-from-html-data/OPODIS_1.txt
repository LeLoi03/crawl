About OPODIS  
 OPODIS  is an open forum for the exchange of state-of-the-art knowledge concerning distributed computing and distributed computer systems. All aspects of distributed systems are within the scope of OPODIS, including theory, specification, design, performance, and system building. With strong roots in the theory of distributed systems, OPODIS now covers the whole range between the theoretical aspects and practical implementations of distributed systems, as well as experimentation and quantitative assessments.
