  Overview   
 For more than 30 years, the IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering Education and Training (CSEE&T) has been the premier conference on software engineering (SE) education and training for academics and professionals. The conference is for educators, researchers, and practitioners to share new findings and results in planning and executing software engineering education, including pedagogy, curricula, tool evaluation, best practices, and experience reports.  
 The main conference program consists of Research track 23 papers (including 12 full papers and 11 short ones), Industrial Experience Reports track 1 paper, Journal First Articles track 3 papers, and Poster and Tool track 10 papers. Topics of the Research and Industrial Experience include the followings: Measurement and Requirements Engineering, Peer Review and Modeling, Agile and Project Management, Teaching Practice, Data Science and AI, SE Pedagogy, and Applied SE.

 Scope   
 CSEE&T 2023 seeks original research papers on novel ideas, methods, and techniques for software engineering education, as well as education experience & industrial training reports. Contributions may concern all fields of software engineering education, including university education at the graduate and undergraduate level, industrial training, and teaching software engineering at various secondary schools. We welcome submissions on any aspects of software engineering education and training.  
 Topics of Interest   
 The list below indicates areas of software engineering education in the focus of CSEE&T 2023, but not limited.  
 Requirements engineering education (REE) 
  Teaching artificial intelligence (TAI) 
  Software engineering education for novices (SEN) 
  Vision for SE education in the future (VEF) 
  Paper Submissions   
 CSEE&T 2023 solicits submissions in the following four separate categories. All page numbers are with the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting and including references.  
 Research track | : Full papers (up to 10 pages) present completed and evaluated original research. Short papers (up to 5 pages) describe well-defined research ideas or ongoing work at an early stage of investigation not yet fully developed or evaluated. 
  Industrial experience reports track | (up to 6 pages) covers industrial training experience. 
  Workshop proposals | (up to 2 pages) present plans of half-day or full-day highly collaborative workshops. 
  Nancy Mead Award nominations 
  All submissions must be in English, and must come in A4 paper size PDF format and conform, at the time of submission, to the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines   
 Submission Information   
 Publications   
 All accepted submissions (except workshop papers) will be submitted to the IEEE-CS Digital Library in the CSEE&T 2023 conference proceedings and are subject to registration and presentation at the conference. If a submission is accepted, at least one author of the paper must register for the conference and present the paper at the conference. If an accepted paper is not presented, the paper is removed from the proceedings.
