  INTRODUCTION  
 The 2023 ACM Web Conference will offer a high quality program made of research sessions, posters and demonstrations, a PhD symposium for the junior scholars, workshops, tutorials, a developers track for the practitioners as well as thought provoking keynote speakers, panels, special track on web for good, History of the Web, and colocated special days.  
 The 2023 ACM Web Conference is an in-person conference with virtual components  including live streaming of ceremonies and keynotes, access to pre-recorded videos of talks, and the Whova platform for interaction with all conference attendees.  
 All speakers, presenters, organizers participating in any way at The Web Conference are expected to attend the conference in person. For exceptional reasons, if you are not able to attend in person to present, you may assign a proxy who must be in person. For special cases, we may make an exception for a live remote presentation.  
  (UPDATE: As of April 26, due to logistical situations, we are not able to accommodate anymore remote presentations)   
 Austin is honored and thrilled to host The Web Conference and is preparing an exceptional conference for sharing the latest insights of academic and industrial research. We thank you for your participation and look forward to seeing you in Austin!
