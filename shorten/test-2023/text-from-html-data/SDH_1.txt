 Dear Colleagues,  
 Due to the persistence of pandemic conditions, our organization committee sadly decided to hold the conference in a virtual environment.   
 Our conference registration fees have also been reorganized according to the virtual format.  
 We look forward to reconnecting virtually with all of you in August.
