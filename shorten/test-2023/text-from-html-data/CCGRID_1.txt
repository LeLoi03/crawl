 IEEE/ACM CCGRID 2023  
 November 30, 2022  
 IEEE/ACM CCGRID 2023  
  The 23rd IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing   
  In conjunction with the 7th IEEE International Conference on Fog and Edge Computing (ICFEC 2023)  
 May 1-4, 2023  
  Bangalore, India   
  The 23rd IEEE/ACM international Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing (CCGrid 2023) is a leading forum to disseminate and discuss research activities and results on a broad range of topics in distributed systems, ranging from computing clusters to widely distributed Clouds and emerging Internet computing paradigms such as Fog and Edge Computing to support Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data applications. The conference will feature keynotes, technical presentations, posters, workshops, tutorials, as well as the SCALE challenge featuring live demonstrations and the ICFEC 2023 conference. The conference places special emphasis on all aspects of equity, diversity and inclusion in systems research. The conference will be held as an in-person event.  
 We, as the CCGrid community, are committed, both individually and collectively, to nurturing diversity and inclusion, sustaining a climate of mutual respect, and fostering a collaborative and supportive environment wherein everyone is empowered to succeed.

  ARTIFACTS   
  Starting this year, CCGRID will be accepting code/data artifacts as supplemental material for accepted papers. These will be reviewed by an Artifact Evaluation committee, examining 1) if the artifacts are available and 2) if they are evaluated, and those that pass will be awarded Reproducibility Badges, specifically "Open Research Objects (ORO)" and "Research Objects Reviewed (ROR)" for the accepted paper on IEEE Xplore. Submission of the artifacts is optional, and will be solicited after the research paper acceptance. More details will be posted soon.
