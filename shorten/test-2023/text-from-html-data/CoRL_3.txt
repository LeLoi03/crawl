 Registration for CORL 2023 is now open!  
  US Visa Invitation:   Due to the time it takes to process US visa applications, we encourage all international attendees needing a visa to register as early as possible. Note, you must register for in-person attendance for the visa invitation letter to be valid. We will refund the cost of the registration if the visa application is denied, as well as any cancellations made by September 10th. The visa invitation letter will be sent to you by email within 2 business days of registration.  
 Author Registration :   At least one author from each accepted paper must be registered to attend in person. Authors of accepted oral papers must attend in person for the oral presentation to remain on the schedule, otherwise the paper presentation format will be altered to a poster.  
 Virtual Attendance:   We are offering the opportunity for virtual attendance of CoRL 2023 at a reduced rate. However, note that virtual participation will be very limited. Specifically:  
 Virtual attendees will be able to watch talks live, as well as potentially contribute questions to the speaker. 
  Virtual attendees will NOT be able to present talks or posters. 
 FAQs  
 We suggest all CoRL 2023 attendees to avail early registration rates. Due to the long processing time in US visa applications, we encourage all potential attendees needing a visa to register early and start a visa application before paper decisions.   
 Kindly note, you must register for in-person attendance for the visa invitation letter to be valid. The visa invitation letter will be sent to you by email within 2 business days of registration.
