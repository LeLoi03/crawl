  Symposium on Discrete Algorithms investigates areas of study like Combinatorics, Discrete mathematics, Algorithm, Time complexity and Upper and lower bounds. While the conference focused on Combinatorics, it was also able to explore topics like Bounded function, Set (abstract data type) and Constant (mathematics). The conference focuses on Discrete mathematics as well as the interrelated topic of Polynomial.  
 The studies tackled, which mainly focus on Algorithm, apply to Theoretical computer science as well. The Binary logarithm research dealing mostly with Log-log plot is the focus of the event. The event is concerned with the study of Approximation algorithm and Mathematical optimization in general.  
 It facilitates discussions on Mathematical optimization that incorporate concepts from other fields like Scheduling (computing) and Competitive analysis. The conference features Competitive analysis research that overlaps with concepts in Online algorithm. The event connects research in Chordal graph with the related topic of Indifference graph.  
 What are the most cited papers published at the conference?  
  Statistics 
  The previous edition focused in particular on these issues:  
 Symposium on Discrete Algorithms facilitates discussions on Combinatorics, Discrete mathematics, Binary logarithm, Time complexity and Algorithm. The concepts on Combinatorics presented in the conference can also apply to other research fields, including Matching (graph theory) and Upper and lower bounds. The tackled Discrete mathematics research is interrelated with Bounded function which concerns subjects like Treewidth.  
 The Binary logarithm works featured in the event incorporate elements from Graph (abstract data type), Deterministic algorithm, Open problem, Space (mathematics) and Data structure. The conference explores research in Graph (abstract data type) and the adjacent study of Omega. The conference explores research in Time complexity and the adjacent study of Class (set theory).  
 The most cited articles from the last conference are:  
  Improved Deterministic Network Decomposition (18 citations) 
  Papers citation over time  
 A key indicator for each conference is its effectiveness in reaching other researchers with the papers published at that venue.

 Publication chance based on affiliation  
 The publication chance index shows the ratio of articles published by the best research institutions at the conference edition to all articles published within that conference. The best research institutions were selected based on the largest number of articles published during all editions of the conference.  
 Returning Authors Index  
 A very common phenomenon observed among researchers publishing scientific articles is the intentional selection of conferences they have already attended in the past. In particular, it is worth analyzing the case when the authors participate in the same conference from year to year.  
 The Returning Authors Index presented below illustrates the ratio of authors who participated in both a given as well as the previous edition of the conference in relation to all participants in a given year.

 The experience to innovation index  
 Our experience to innovation index was created to show a cross-section of the experience level of authors publishing at a conference. The index includes the authors publishing at the last edition of a conference  , grouped by total number of publications throughout their academic career (P) and the total number of citations of these publications ever received (C).  
 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups:  
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25),
