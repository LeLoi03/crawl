 Call for Papers  
 The 15 th  Asian Conference on Machine Learning (ACML 2023) will take place between November 11 - 14, 2023 in İstanbul, Turkey. The conference aims to provide a leading international forum for researchers in machine learning and related fields to share their new ideas, progress and achievements.  
 The conference calls for high-quality, original research papers in the theory and practice of machine learning. The conference also solicits proposals focusing on frontier research, new ideas and paradigms in machine learning. We encourage submissions from all parts of the world, not only confined to the Asia-Pacific region.  
 The conference runs two publication tracks, authors may submit either to:

  Submission Instructions  
 Similar to previous years, ACML 2023 has two publication tracks  . Authors may submit either to:  
  Journal Track: | (20-page limit with references) for which accepted papers will appear in a special issue of the Springer Machine Learning Journal (MLJ). 
  Please note that submission procedures for the two tracks are different. Please read the instructions carefully before submitting.    
 Conference Track  
 IMPORTANT:   When creating a new submission on CMT, please ensure you choose the "Conference"  track.  
 The Latex submission template and style file can be found here: ACML2023_submission_template.zip  .  
  The Latex camera-ready template and style file can be found here: ACML2023_camera-ready_template.zip  .  
 Manuscripts must be written in English, be a maximum of 16 pages (including references, appendices, etc.) and follow the PMLR style. If required, supplementary material may be submitted as a separate file, but reviewers are not obliged to consider this.  
 All conference track submissions must be anonymized  . Submissions that are not anonymized, over-length, or not in the correct format will be rejected without review. To anonymize, simply leave the author information empty in the Tex template. There is no separate format for anonymizing.  
 It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g., in arXiv) as long as it is not cited in the submission.  
 Journal Track  
 Submission Deadline: June 02, 2023  May 26, 2023   In addition to the conference track, this year’s ACML will run a journal track, similar to previous years. Papers that are accepted to the journal track must be presented at the conference in order to be published.  
 IMPORTANT:   Similar to previous years, for the journal track, the abstract and the paper must be submitted to two different systems simultaneously   for the purpose of review management:  
 The journal track will follow the reviewing process of the Machine Learning journal. This includes allowing papers that require minor changes to be resubmitted after a first-round review. The journal track committee will aim to complete the reviewing process in time for this year’s conference. In the unlikely event that the reviewing process for a paper is not completed in time (for this year’s conference), the paper will not be considered for the conference and the review will be completed as a regular submission to the Machine Learning journal.  
 The journal track review is single-blind, i.e., the authors’ identity will be visible to reviewers. It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. Submissions that are not in the correct format will be rejected without review. In addition, extended versions of published conference papers are not eligible for journal track submission. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g., in arXiv).
