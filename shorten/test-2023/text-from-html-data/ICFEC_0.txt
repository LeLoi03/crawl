  Bangalore (Bengaluru) is the "Silicon Valley" of India, home to top technology companies from India and globally and a hub for startups. Bangalore is also within driving distance to cultural and UNESCO heritage sites like Hampi, Mysore Palace and Mahabalipuram, and a short flight away from the Taj Mahal in Agra and the beaches of Goa. Bangalore Airport (BLR) has direct air connectivity to major cities in Europe and Asia, and one-hop connectivity to USA and Australia.

 About  
 ICFEC 2023  
 The 7th IEEE International Conference on Fog and Edge Computing (ICFEC 2023) is a leading forum to disseminate and discuss research activities and results on a broad range of topics in the fields of fog and edge computing. ICFEC 2023 will take place in conjunction with The 23rd International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing (CCGrid 2023).  
  Fog and edge computing have received much attention by both the research community and the industry in recent years, and are today seen as an alternative to the utilization of cloud-based computational resources. Especially, this is the case in scenarios where large amounts of data are produced in distributed settings, e.g., in the Internet of Things (IoT), where data needs to be processed in (near) real time, or where suboptimal network connectivity hampers the upload of very large amounts of data to the cloud. Use cases for fog and edge computing range from smart factories over smart grids to autonomous vehicles, to name just some examples.
