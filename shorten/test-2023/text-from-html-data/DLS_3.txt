  Citation: This paper explored the costs, both at micro and macro scale of various strategies for protecting gradual types in a gradually-typed programming language, examining how different strategies affected untyped typed, or both components of code. It is a seminal contribution to understanding the performance of gradual typing, which since then has been an area of important research. The strategies used in gradually-typed languages today can trace their lineage back to the strategies described and proposed in this paper. In particular, the proposed hybrid approach has been adapted time and time again by many systems, giving this work a lasting impact beyond its original scope.

 It is our pleasure to welcome you to the 19th edition of the Dynamic Language Symposium (DLS 2023), co-located with SPLASH 2023 in Cascais, Portugal. After about two decades of dynamic language research and DLS, it is time to reflect and look forward to what the next two decades will bring. This yearâ€™s DLS is therefore a special one focusing on the Future of Dynamic Languages. To do the notion of symposium  justice, we invited speakers to present their opinions on where dynamic languages might be, will be, or should be in the next twenty years.  
 We have 11 invited takes covering a wide range of areas including how dynamic languages should change how they can be used at scale from the perspective of tooling and performance how to interact with other language ecosystems and new developments such as generative artificial intelligence.  
 We warmly thank the Program Committee, the SPLASH organization, the speakers, and, last but not least, the audience.
