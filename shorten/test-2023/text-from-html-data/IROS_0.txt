 Welcome to IROS 2023  
 The Next Generation of Robotics  The 2023 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2023) will be held October 1 – 5, 2023 at Huntington Place   in Detroit, Michigan, USA.  
 IROS is a large and impactful forum for the international robotics research community to explore the frontier of science and technology in intelligent robots and smart machines, emphasizing future directions and the latest approaches, designs, and outcomes.  
 The theme of IROS 2023 is “The Next Generation of Robotics,” so the conference aims to particularly highlight the contributions of younger researchers and to help accelerate the future contributions of all those just entering the field. This will be reflected in plenary and keynote talks, workshops, tutorials, forums, competitions, exhibitions, tours, and technical sessions.
