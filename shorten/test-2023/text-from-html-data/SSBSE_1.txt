 The objective of the Symposium on Search Based Software Engineering (SSBSE) is to bring the rapidly growing international search based software engineering community together in a welcoming forum for discussion and dissemination, as well as to sustain the flourishing of interest in the field from researchers and practitioners in software engineering and metaheuristic search alike. SSBSE has a well-documented charter and organises itself with an open democratic process.  
 If you are interested in being general chair for a future edition of SSBSE, please feel free to reach out to steering committee members.
