 24th IFIP / Socolnet Working Conference on Virtual Enterprises  
 Valencia, Spain   
 27-29 Sep 2023  
 Resilient and Responsible Collaborative Networks  
 On the other hand, we live in an era with more and more disruptive events, including natural and human-caused ones, which demands systems with a high degree of resilience. As frequent disruptive events become the “new normal”, we need advanced forms of transformative resilience and even antifragility. In other words, how to design and manage collaborative ecosystems that can strive and become better throughout a sequence of attacks/disruptions.  
 PRO-VE 2023 aims to analyze and discuss the contribution of Collaborative Networks to these challenges and to identify how these challenges can influence our research agenda.
