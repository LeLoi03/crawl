  Features 
 We are pleased to announce the 18th Annual ACM / IEEE International Conference on Human Robot Interaction (HRI).  
 HRI 2023 is the 18th annual conference for basic and applied HRI research.  
 Researchers from around the world submit their best work to HRI to exchange ideas on theory, technology, data and science that advance the state of the art in the field.  
 The conference theme for HRI 2023 is "HRI for All" and will focus on key HRI theories, methods, projects, studies and technical advances that aim to understand and promote inclusion and diversity in HRI.  
 We encourage the community to consider ways both to make the camp a more inclusive place for those who may not feel included, and to encourage inclusion in our research methods and practices.  
 There are many ways to participate in HRI 2023, including full documents, overdue reports, demos, videos, and workshops.  
 There are many opportunities to engage, particularly for students and those new to the field, including through volunteering and attending mentoring seminars.  
 The conference will take place March 13-16, 2023 in Stockholm, Sweden.  
 Our goal is for it to be a hybrid conference, with opportunities to attend both in person and online.  
 We will publish more details as the conference date approaches.
