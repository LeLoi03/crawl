 The cross-domain conference is dedicated to offer an international platform for novel ideas and a fresh look on the methodologies to put crazy ideas into Business for the benefit of the human. Serendipity is a desired effect, and shall cross-fertilize methodologies and transfer of algorithmic developments.  
 The goal of the CD-MAKE conference is to bring together researchers from machine learning and knowledge extraction areas in an cross-disciplinary manner, to stimulate fresh ideas and to encourage multi-disciplinary problem solving.  
 Motto: Science is to test crazy ideas – Engineering is to put these ideas into Business!
