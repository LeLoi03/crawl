 ICKE 2023 | Fujisawa (Kanagawa), Japan | March 18-20, 2023  
 The focus of the ICKE is to establish an effective platform for institutions and industries to share ideas and to present the works of scientists, engineers, educators and students from all over the world. The organizing committee of conference is pleased to invite prospective authors to submit their original manuscripts to ICKE.  
 Given the on-going Covid-19 pandemic, there is currently uncertainty in the format of the Conference. However, the safety of our speakers and attendees will remain of paramount concern. Thus, we will be partially prepared to deliver a virtual conference.
