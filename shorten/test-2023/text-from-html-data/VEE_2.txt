Virtual Execution Environments (VEE)  
 The goal of Virtual Execution Environments is to be a first-rate research forum that brings together leading practitioners and researchers in the broad area of virtualization, which includes topics such as high-level language virtual machines (JVM, CLR etc.), process and system virtual machines, translators, machine emulators, and simulators.  
 VEE Steering Committee   
 The current VEE steering committee is:  
 Jennifer B. Sartor | (Ghent University and Vrije Universiteit Brussel) 
  Chris Rossbach | (UT Austin) 
 VEE Steering Committee Composition   
 The VEE steering committee (SC) comprises past general and program chairs and a USENIX representative, assuming USENIX continues to co-sponsor the event. After each instance of VEE, membership on the steering committee will be updated as follows:  
 Additions   
 The general and program chairs of the most recent VEE conference will be invited to join the SC, if they are not already members.  
 Deletions   
 When the conference has been held for a number of years, members will be removed from the committee based on the date of the last time they were general chair (GC) or program chair of VEE.  
 The GC in year X becomes the SC Chair in year X+2. In other words, the GC serves one year, participates in the SC the next year, and then chairs it the third year.
