 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Multimedia Signal and Vision Processing (IEEE CIMSIVP)  
 A better understanding of the computational principles underlying image, multimedia, signal and visual information processing, perception and cognition is one of the most fundamental challenges of contemporary science. Deeper insight into such principles may help us achieve more robust, faster, and more efficient intelligent systems. In particular, the fields of computer vision, and image and signal processing have tried to automate tasks that the human visual and auditory systems can do, with the aim of gaining a high-level understanding of images and videos. In this context, numerous algorithms have been successfully applied to a large number of real-world problems ranging from remote sensing to medical image analysis, video surveillance, human-robot interaction, and computer-aided design. This Symposium will address theory and applications of computational intelligence approaches in image, multimedia, signal and vision processing.
