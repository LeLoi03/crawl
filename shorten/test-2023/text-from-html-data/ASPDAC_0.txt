  A presenter can provide a pre-recorded presentation in advance for backup.  
  If neither a live nor a pre-recorded video presentation is given, then it will be treated as no-show and the paper will be removed from the proceedings, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore.  
  For presenters who cannot attend in person, we are highly recommend to provide a pre-recorded video presentation.

 The format of the conference is hybrid but mainly in-person for speakers. All speakers are expected to attend ASP-DAC 2023 physically unless a speaker has some inevitable reasons such as medical reasons and government orders.
