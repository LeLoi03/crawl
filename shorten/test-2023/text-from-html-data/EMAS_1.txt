 11th International Workshop on Engineering Multi-Agent Systems  
 In conjunction with AAMAS 2023  (29-30 May 2023, London, UK)  
  A key unifying theme underlying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning is the idea of intelligent software agents able to reason, act, interact, and learn. This metaphor has stimulated much research in AI and particularly in Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems, giving rise to research in agent-oriented software engineering, programming multi-agent systems, and declarative agent languages and technologies.  
 EMAS 2023 will provide a forum for researchers and practitioners interested in the theory and practice of engineering intelligent agents and multi-agent systems (MAS). The overall purpose of the workshop is to facilitate the cross-fertilization of ideas and experiences in the various fields to:  
 enhance our knowledge of the theory and practice of engineering intelligent agents and multi-agent systems, and advance the state of the art; 
  demonstrate how MAS methodologies, architectures, languages, and tools can be used in the engineering of deployed large-scale, open, and data-driven MAS;
