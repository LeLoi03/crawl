 International Conference on Knowledge Capture (K-CAP)*  
 Monthly Featured   
 The biennial International Conference On Knowledge Capture (K-CAP)  , formerly the Knowledge Acquisition Workshop (KAW) series 1)  , is providing a forum that brings together members of disparate research communities that are interested in efficiently capturing knowledge from a variety of sources and in creating representations that can be useful for reasoning, analysis, and other forms of machine processing.  
 K-CAP is held on odd yeary, alternately with EKAW  – the International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management.  
 The conference is sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery, Special Interest Group on Artificial (ACM SIGAI) among others.  
 Of special “Knowledge Management” interest:
