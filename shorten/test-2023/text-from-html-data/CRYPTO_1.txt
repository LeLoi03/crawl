 Exploring Decryption Failures of BIKE: New Class of Weak Keys and Key Recovery Attacks  
  Abstract   
 Code-based cryptography has received a lot of attention recently because it is considered secure under quantum computing. Among them, the QC-MDPC based scheme is one of the most promising due to its excellent performance. QC-MDPC based schemes are usually subject to a small rate of decryption failure, which can leak information about the secret key. This raises two crucial problems: how to accurately estimate the decryption failure rate and how to use the failure information to recover the secret key. However, the two problems are challenging due to the difficulty of geometrically characterizing the bit-flipping decoder employed in QC-MDPC, such as using decoding radius.   
  Abstract   
 We present cryptanalysis of the inhomogenous short integer solution ( \(\textsf{ISIS}_{}\)  ) problem for anomalously small moduli \(q\)  by exploiting the geometry of BKZ reduced bases of q  -ary lattices.   
 We apply this cryptanalysis to examples from the literature where taking such small moduli has been suggested. A recent work [Espitau–Tibouchi–Wallet–Yu, CRYPTO 2022] suggests small \(q\)  versions of the lattice signature scheme Falcon  and its variant Mitaka  . For one small \(q\)  parametrisation of Falcon  we reduce the estimated security against signature forgery by approximately 26 bits. For one small \(q\)  parametrisation of Mitaka  we successfully forge a signature in 15 s.

  Abstract   
 In this paper we present the first practical-time attack on GOST with secret S-boxes. The attack works in the related-key model and is faster than all previous attacks in this model which assume that the S-boxes are known. The complexity of the attack is less than \(2^{27}\)  encryptions. It was fully verified, and runs in a few seconds on a PC. The attack is based on a novel type of related-key differentials of GOST, inspired by local collisions.   
 Our new technique may be applicable to certain GOST-based hash functions as well. To demonstrate this, we show how to find a collision on a Davies-Meyer construction based on GOST with an arbitrary initial value, in less than \(2^{10}\)  hash function evaluations.

 Moving a Step of ChaCha in Syncopated Rhythm  
  Abstract   
 The stream cipher ChaCha is one of the most widely used ciphers in the real world, such as in TLS, SSH and so on. In this paper, we study the security of ChaCha via differential cryptanalysis based on probabilistic neutrality bits (PNBs). We introduce the syncopation  technique for the PNB-based approximation in the backward direction, which significantly amplifies its correlation by utilizing the property of ARX structure. In virtue of this technique, we present a new and efficient method for finding a good set of PNBs. A refined framework of key-recovery attack is then formalized for round-reduced ChaCha. The new techniques allow us to break 7.5 rounds of ChaCha without the last XOR and rotation, as well as to bring faster attacks on 6 rounds and 7 rounds of ChaCha.

 Cryptanalysis of Symmetric Primitives over Rings and a Key Recovery Attack on Rubato  
  Abstract   
 Symmetric primitives are a cornerstone of cryptography, and have traditionally been defined over fields, where cryptanalysis is now well understood. However, a few symmetric primitives defined over rings  \(\mathbb Z _q\)  for a composite number \(q\)  have recently been proposed, a setting where security is much less studied. In this paper we focus on studying established algebraic attacks typically defined over fields and the extent of their applicability to symmetric primitives defined over the ring of integers modulo a composite \(q\)  . Based on our analysis, we present an attack on full Rubato  , a family of symmetric ciphers proposed by Ha et al. at Eurocrypt 2022 designed to be used in a transciphering framework for approximate fully homomorphic encryption. We show that at least 25 \(\%\)  of the possible choices for \(q\)  satisfy certain conditions that lead to a successful key recovery attack with complexity significantly lower than the claimed security level for five of the six ciphers in the Rubato  family.

 Learning with Physical Rounding for Linear and Quadratic Leakage Functions  
  Abstract   
 Fresh re-keying is a countermeasure against side-channel analysis where an ephemeral key is derived from a long-term key using a public random value. Popular instances of such schemes rely on key-homomorphic primitives, so that the re-keying process is easy to mask and the rest of the (e.g., block cipher) computations can run with cheaper countermeasures. The main requirement for these schemes to be secure is that the leakages of the ephemeral keys do not allow recovering the long-term key. The Learning with Physical Rounding (LWPR) problem formalizes this security in a practically-relevant model where the adversary can observe noise-free leakages. It can be viewed as a physical version of the Learning With Rounding (LWR) problem, where the rounding is performed by a leakage function and therefore does not have to be computed explicitly. In this paper, we first consolidate the intuition that LWPR cannot be secure in a serial implementation context without additional countermeasures (like shuffling), due to attacks exploiting worst-case leakages that can be mounted with practical data complexity. We then extend the understanding of LWPR in a parallel implementation setting. On the one hand, we generalize its robustness against cryptanalysis taking advantage of any (i.e., not only worst-case) leakage. A previous work claimed security in the specific context of a Hamming weight leakage function. We clarify necessary conditions to maintain this guarantee, based on the degree of the leakage function and the accuracy of its coefficients. On the other hand, we show that parallelism inherently provides good security against attacks exploiting worst-case leakages. We finally confirm the practical relevance of these findings by validating our assumptions experimentally for an exemplary implementation.

 Coefficient Grouping for Complex Affine Layers  
  Abstract   
 Designing symmetric-key primitives for applications in Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) has become important to address the issue of the ciphertext expansion. In such a context, cryptographic primitives with a low-AND-depth decryption circuit are desired. Consequently, quadratic nonlinear functions are commonly used in these primitives, including the well-known \(\chi \)  function over \(\mathbb {F}_2^n\)  and the power map over a large finite field \(\mathbb {F}_{p^n}\)  . In this work, we study the growth of the algebraic degree for an SPN cipher over \(\mathbb {F}_{2^n}^{m}\)  , whose S-box is defined as the combination of a power map \(x\mapsto x^{2^d+1}\)  and an \(\mathbb {F}_2\)  -linearized affine polynomial \(x\mapsto c_0+\sum _{i=1}^{w}c_ix^{2^{h_i}}\)  where \(c_1,\ldots ,c_w\ne 0\)  . Specifically, motivated by the fact that the original coefficient grouping technique published at EUROCRYPT 2023 becomes less efficient for \(w>1\)  , we develop a variant technique that can efficiently work for arbitrary w  . With this new technique to study the upper bound of the algebraic degree, we answer the following questions from a theoretic perspective: 1.  can the algebraic degree increase exponentially when \(w=1\)  ?   
 2.  what is the influence of w  , d  and \((h_1,\ldots ,h_w)\)  on the growth of the algebraic degree?   
 Horst Meets Fluid-SPN: Griffin for Zero-Knowledge Applications  
  Abstract   
 Zero-knowledge (ZK) applications form a large group of use cases in modern cryptography, and recently gained in popularity due to novel proof systems. For many of these applications, cryptographic hash functions are used as the main building blocks, and they often dominate the overall performance and cost of these approaches.   
 Therefore, in the last years several new hash functions were built in order to reduce the cost in these scenarios, including Poseidon  and Rescue  among others. These hash functions often look very different from more classical designs such as AES or SHA-2. For example, they work natively over prime fields rather than binary ones. At the same time, for example Poseidon  and Rescue  share some common features, such as being SPN schemes and instantiating the nonlinear layer with invertible power maps. While this allows the designers to provide simple and strong arguments for establishing their security, it also introduces crucial limitations in the design, which may affect the performance in the target applications.   
 In this paper, we propose the Horst  construction, in which the addition in a Feistel scheme \((x,y)\mapsto (y+F(x), x)\)  is extended via a multiplication, i.e., \((x,y)\mapsto (y\times G(x) + F(x), x)\)  .   
 By carefully analyzing the performance metrics in SNARK and STARK protocols, we show how to combine an expanding Horst  scheme with a Rescue  -like SPN scheme in order to provide security and better efficiency in the target applications. We provide an extensive security analysis for our new design Griffin  and a comparison with all current competitors.   
 On the Security of Keyed Hashing Based on Public Permutations  
  Abstract   
 Doubly-extendable cryptographic keyed functions (deck) generalize the concept of message authentication codes (MAC) and stream ciphers in that they support variable-length strings as input and return variable-length strings as output. A prominent example of building deck functions is Farfalle, which consists of a set of public permutations and rolling functions that are used in its compression and expansion layers. By generalizing the compression layer of Farfalle, we prove its universality in terms of the probability of differentials over the public permutation used in it. As the compression layer of Farfalle is inherently parallel, we compare it to a generalization of a serial compression function inspired by Pelican-MAC. The same public permutation may result in different universalities depending on whether the compression is done in parallel or serial. The parallel construction consistently performs better than the serial one, sometimes by a big factor. We demonstrate this effect using Xoodoo  \([3]\)  , which is a round-reduced variant of the public permutation used in the deck function Xoofff.

 : Isogeny-Based (Partially) Blind Signatures from the Class Group Action with a Twist  
  Abstract   
 In this paper, we construct the first provably-secure isogeny-based (partially) blind signature scheme. While at a high level the scheme resembles the Schnorr blind signature, our work does not directly follow from that construction, since isogenies do not offer as rich an algebraic structure. Specifically, our protocol does not fit into the linear identification protocol  abstraction introduced by Hauck, Kiltz, and Loss (EUROCYRPT’19), which was used to generically construct Schnorr-like blind signatures based on modules such as classical groups and lattices. Consequently, our scheme does not seem susceptible to the recent efficient ROS attack exploiting the linear nature of the underlying mathematical tool.   
 Weak Instances of Class Group Action Based Cryptography via Self-pairings  
  Abstract   
 In this paper we study non-trivial self-pairings with cyclic domains that are compatible with isogenies between elliptic curves oriented by an imaginary quadratic order \(\mathcal {O}\)  . We prove that the order m  of such a self-pairing necessarily satisfies \(m \mid \varDelta _\mathcal {O}\)  (and even \(2m \mid \varDelta _\mathcal {O}\)  if \(4 \mid \varDelta _\mathcal {O}\)  and \(4m \mid \varDelta _\mathcal {O}\)  if \(8 \mid \varDelta _\mathcal {O}\)  ) and is not a multiple of the field characteristic. Conversely, for each m  satisfying these necessary conditions, we construct a family of non-trivial cyclic self-pairings of order m  that are compatible with oriented isogenies, based on generalized Weil and Tate pairings.   
 As an application, we identify weak instances of class group actions on elliptic curves assuming the degree of the secret isogeny is known. More in detail, we show that if \(m^2 \mid \varDelta _\mathcal {O}\)  for some prime power m  then given two primitively \(\mathcal {O}\)  -oriented elliptic curves \((E, \iota )\)  and \((E',\iota ') = [\mathfrak {a}](E,\iota )\)  connected by an unknown invertible ideal \(\mathfrak {a}\subseteq \mathcal {O}\)  , we can recover \(\mathfrak {a}\)  essentially at the cost of a discrete logarithm computation in a group of order \(m^2\)  , assuming the norm of \(\mathfrak {a}\)  is given and is smaller than \(m^2\)  . We give concrete instances, involving ordinary elliptic curves over finite fields, where this turns into a polynomial time attack.   
 Finally, we show that these self-pairings simplify known results on the decisional Diffie–Hellman problem for class group actions on oriented elliptic curves.
