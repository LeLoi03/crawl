 23rd International Conference on Innovations for Community Services (I4CS)  
  It is with great honor that we welcome you to the 23rd Computer Science Conference on Innovations for Community Services, with the motto "Creating Digital Spirit."  
 Over the past two decades, this conference has brought together researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders from diverse fields to explore the latest advances in computer science and their potential applications for improving community services. This year, we are excited to continue this tradition and delve into the theme of "Creating Digital Spirit," which aims to examine the role of technology in shaping the spirit and well-being of our communities.  
 Through presentations, panel discussions, and interactive workshops, we will explore a range of topics related to the intersection of technology and community, including digital literacy, e-governance, and the use of data for social good. We believe that by fostering a spirit of collaboration and innovation, we can identify creative solutions to the challenges faced by communities and work towards building a more connected and sustainable future.  
 We hope that you will find this conference to be a valuable and inspiring experience, and we look forward to your active participation and contributions.  
 Thank you for joining us.
