 ETHICOMP has fostered an international community of academics, technologists, and industry professionals dedicated to exploring the ethical dimensions of computing. ETHICOMP serves as a platform for interdisciplinary dialogue, addressing philosophical, professional, and practical aspects of computing ethics. Our conferences have significantly shaped ethical standards and practices in the digital age.

 2. Let’s reevaluate cybersecurity best practices  (Shalini Kesar, Southern Utah University, kesar@suu.edu; and Sabina Szymoniak Czestochowa University of Technology, sabina.szymoniak@icis.pcz.pl)  
 Today’s society is becoming more dependent on technology, where organizations and individuals cannot function without smart devices in their daily lives. Nowadays, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Internet of Things (IoT) is playing a key role in defining cybersecurity best practices. For example, AI-powered threat detection, anomaly detection, and automated response systems are becoming more sophisticated in identifying and mitigating cyber threats, as well as identifying threats and vulnerabilities. To manage and minimize these data threats, it is important for organizations to reevaluate their cybersecurity strategies and best practices. This track invites articles that discuss the emerging trends in cybersecurity along with their ethical implications of digital interaction when organizations are developing best practices.  
 3. Ethical challenges of human relations in education in the AI era  (Mario Arias-Oliva, Universidad Complutense de Madrid Mar Souto-Romero, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos de Madrid, mario.arias@ucm.es; Antonio Pérez-Portabella, Universitat Rovira i Virgili Graciela Padilla Castillo, Universidad Complutense de Madrid; antonio. perezportabella@urv.cat)  
 Digital technologies offer numerous benefits to educational relationships, including improved communication, collaboration, and access to resources. However, they also present challenges that educators, students, and policymakers must navigate carefully to ensure positive and equitable outcomes. Teacher-student relationships have changed, with teachers becoming facilitators rather than sole sources of knowledge. While technology improves communication between students, teachers, and parents, it can also affect peer relationships, where online collaboration can lead to reduced face-to-face interaction. Excessive digital communication can diminish empathy and social skills, while virtual communities can foster a sense of belonging in online education. Furthermore, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into education introduces new dimensions to these relationships. AI-powered tutoring systems and chatbots can provide personalized support to students, but they also raise concerns about the role of human educators and the potential loss of human connection in the learning process. This track welcomes submissions that explore the multifaceted impact of digital technologies on education in general, including contributions on digital human relationships in education, such as changes in teacher-student dynamics, peer interactions, mentoring, virtual communities, and the ethical implications of AI in learning environments.  
 4. Gender and Future Digital Technologies  (Shalini Kesar, Southern Utah University, kesar@suu.edu)  
 With emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things, it is important to explore the role of gender, as gender disparity can create barriers to managing and sustaining digital technologies. Diverse perspectives and technological innovation can help overcome challenges to economic growth, productivity, solve complex technological problems, drive innovation, and shape the future of technology across multiple sectors. This track welcomes paper proposals from scholars across all fields, as well as practitioners, policymakers, educators, and others whose work or experiences overlap with this theme.  
 5. The normative challenges of AI literacy  (Ludovica Paseri, UNITO, ludovica.paseri@unito.it; and Ugo Pagallo, UNITO, ugo.pagallo@unito.it)
