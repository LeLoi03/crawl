  2nd Annual Compiler Frontiers Workshop (2023)  
 Aim and scope:   
  As architectures grow in complexity and power/performance requirements evolve far beyond what traditional data center environments offer, advances in compiler technology are paramount to enable the construction of performant, power-efficient, and resilient application payloads. The ability to build programming model support, compilers, optimizers, and associated tooling for advanced architectures is now at the forefront of computer science and computer architecture research. This workshop seeks to bring together researchers and experts from industry and academia to present the latest advances in Compilers for Computing Frontiers. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: Compiler extensions for HPC, HPDC, IoT, Cloud, and Edge computing
