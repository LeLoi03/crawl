 Technical Papers  
 To explore SIGGRAPH 2023 content in detail, please review Technical Papers’ listing on the ACM Digital Library.  
 View Program Content   
 The SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program spans areas including but not limited to animation, simulation, imaging, geometry, modeling, rendering, human-computer interaction, haptics, fabrication, robotics, visualization, audio, optics, programming languages, immersive experiences, and machine learning for visual computing.  
 At SIGGRAPH 2023, similar to 2022, the Technical Papers program will have two integrated paper tracks: Journal (ACM Transactions on Graphics)  and Conference.   
 Journal Papers are expected to satisfy the ACM TOG criteria of excellence established over the years, and contain novel, well validated, and comprehensively described ideas which advance the state of the art. Papers accepted to the Journal track will be published in the SIGGRAPH 2023 issue of ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)  .  
 Conference Papers are expected to contain novel ideas and similarly advance the state of the art but can be less complete or comprehensive (e.g., have less extensive validation or formal verification). As such, the length of papers accepted to this track is capped  as outlined below. Papers accepted to this track will be published in the SIGGRAPH 2023 Conference Proceedings.  
 At submission time, authors can indicate if their submission should be considered for the Journal track only  or whether they want the submission to be considered for both tracks  .  
 The review process, deadline, and committee are the same for both tracks. Papers considered for both tracks are first evaluated to determine if the contribution is of sufficient quality for SIGGRAPH. If judged to be of sufficient quality they are then assessed based on the criteria above to determine the track to be accepted into.    
 The differences in the submission process for the two options are outlined below.   
 Journal-Only Submissions   
 The submitted work is expected to be novel and advance the state of the art.    
 Ideas are extensively tried and tested, and the paper is complete and comprehensive.  
 When submitting, use the “acmtog” article style, double column. No limit on the length or file size of supplementary materials.   
 No maximum (or minimum) page length.  
 The work can be less complete (e.g., have shorter validation and fewer comparisons).  
 When submitting, use the “acmtog” article style, double column. No limit on the length or file size of supplementary materials.   
 The submissions are required to adhere to the following length constraints: Papers must be no longer than 7 pages excluding references and figures-only pages. There is no limit on the length of the reference section. Each paper can have at most two figures-only pages, placed at the end of the submission, after references. Authors can also include as many figures as they wish within the core 7 pages. Papers should not include appendices in the main document.

 Note: Submissions for Technical Papers are currently closed.   
  We are excited you are submitting your work for consideration.  
 Start by reading the information below about how to prepare your submission, including information on formatting, anonymity, and resubmissions. Then log into the submission portal  , select the “New Submission” tab, and select the Technical Papers submission form. You will be asked for basic information about your submission.  
 To see what you will need to submit, view the sample form  (Stage 1). Creating a submission form will assign your submission a paper ID, which must be included in your submitted paper.  
 Deadlines   
 Tuesday, 24 January 2023: Submission form deadline   
 Deadline for creating the submission form with the title, the complete list of co-authors, as well as the specification of conflicts of interest (COI) for each co-author. Note that once the paper is submitted, the list of authors can no longer be edited  . Exceptions can be made in special circumstances but are expected to be rare and are up to the discretion of the Technical Papers Chair.  
 Wednesday, 25 January 2023: Paper deadline   
 Deadline for the complete submission, including either the actual PDF paper or an MD5 checksum (which will be required in lieu of the actual files starting at some point on this day). If you wish to submit supplemental material (additional details or comparisons, movies, code, data, etc.) as well, these files (or their MD5 checksums) must also be uploaded by this date and time. To see what you will need to submit, view the sample form  (Stage 2).  
 Thursday, 26 January 2023: Upload deadline   
 Deadline for uploading all materials if you used MD5 checksums  . No new or changed material may be uploaded. Only files matching MD5 checksums submitted the previous day are valid.  
 English Review Service   
  Non-native English speakers may optionally use the English Review Service  to help improve the text of submissions. Please note that this process takes time, so plan far ahead in order to meet the submission deadline.  
 Physical Submission of Supplemental Materials   
 Alla Sheffer  
 All complete submissions received by the deadline will be acknowledged by email. For this purpose, a submission is complete if a paper ID has been assigned and a PDF file of the paper and a representative image have been successfully uploaded. Such submissions will be reviewed unless they are withdrawn by the author. For more information about the papers submission and rebuttal process, please refer to the Technical Papers FAQ  .  
 For more information about uploading files for your submission, please refer to the Technical Papers FAQ  .  
 Back to Top    
  All submitted papers (independent of the track they are submitted to) will receive at least five double-blind reviews and will be evaluated by the Technical Papers Committee.  
 When deciding which track a dual-track submission is suitable for, reviewers will be instructed to expect similar novelty for both programs and to consider completeness when assessing the track the paper should be accepted to. Specifically, they will be instructed to be less demanding about formal completeness, validation and experimental evaluation when it comes to accepting papers to the Conference track, thereby allowing publication of riskier/earlier-stage work.  
 Both tracks will continue the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program from previous years, publishing high-quality, ground-breaking research that is presented at SIGGRAPH. Journal Papers will be published in the ACM Transactions on Graphics  . Conference Papers will be published in the SIGGRAPH Conference Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.

 Submission Policy  
  Double Submissions   
  By submitting a manuscript to the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program, authors acknowledge that the technical contributions they claim have not been previously published or accepted for publication in another peer-reviewed venue and that no manuscript substantially similar in content is currently under review or will be submitted to any peer-reviewed venue during the SIGGRAPH review period. Violations constitute grounds for immediate rejection. If you wish to submit revised or extended versions of Conference or workshop Papers, please directly submit to TOG instead of SIGGRAPH.  
 Plagiarism   
  A submission to the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program should describe an original work of the authors. Authors must not use ideas or content originating from others without properly crediting their original sources. Note that such sources are not limited to peer-reviewed publications, but also include patents, textbooks, technical reports, theses, unpublished work posted on arXiv, as well as other posts on the World Wide Web. Failure to comply with this requirement will be considered plagiarism and result in rejection. For more details, please consult the guidance  provided by ACM.  
 Anonymity   
  The SIGGRAPH review process is fully double-blind: The committee members and external reviewers do not know the identity of the authors, and the authors do not know the identity of the reviewers. This anonymity is an integral part of an objective and fair review process, so authors are required to take all reasonable measures to preserve their anonymity. Specific instructions for preserving anonymity in your submission are discussed in the Submission Requirements  section. Rules on how to preserve anonymity before and after submission when communicating about the work with others are set forth in the SIGGRAPH 2023 anonymity policy  . Authors are expected to familiarize themselves with the policy and strictly adhere to it.  
 Citing Prior Art   
  Authors are expected to cite, discuss differences and novelty, and compare results, if applicable, with respect to relevant existing publications, provided they have been published in a peer-reviewed venue before the SIGGRAPH submission deadline. This also applies to patents, which undergo a professional reviewing process.  
 But what about technical reports, and other non-peer-reviewed publications, such as technical reports or papers posted on arXiv, which we henceforth refer to as prepublications? With the rapid progress of search engines and the increased perusal of arXiv papers by the scientific community, asking authors to thoroughly compare their work to these prepublications imposes an unreasonable burden: a seemingly relevant report that is incomplete in its disclosure or validation might appear online shortly before the deadline. While peer-reviewed publications are certainly not immune to these shortcomings, they have, at least, been judged sufficiently complete and valid by a group of peers. Consequently, authors are not  required to discuss and compare their work with recent prepublications (arXiv, technical reports, theses, etc.), although they must properly cite  those that inspired them (see “Plagiarism”  above). We nevertheless encourage authors to mention all related works they are aware of as good academic practice dictates. Note that with new works posted on arXiv on a daily basis, it is increasingly likely that reviewers might point out similarities between the submitted work and online reports that have been missed by the authors. In this case, authors of conditionally accepted papers should be prepared to cite these prepublications in their final revision as concurrent work, without the burden of having to detail how their work compares to or differs from these prepublications. Authors may want to upload as supplementary material anonymized versions of any relevant tech report or arXiv posting of their own, if the work can be perceived to have overlap, in terms of contribution, with the submission.  
 Citing Own Prior Art   
  When citing already published work by the same (or an overlapping) group of authors, the citation should refer to that work in the third person, just as it would refer to any other previously published work by a completely different set of authors. For other relevant work from the same author(s) as the submission, we distinguish between two cases: (A) works that have been submitted for publication elsewhere, but have some relevance to and/or overlap with the submission; and (B) largely overlapping prepublications that are available online at the time of submission (arXiv, technical report, thesis, etc.).  
 For case (A), the other work (e.g., tech report, arXiv posting) should be cited anonymously, as well as provided as anonymous supplementary material. The authors must convince the reviewers that the current submission is sufficiently different from the other work, which can be done using an anonymous cover letter that outlines the differences. 
  For case (B), these earlier or largely similar versions of the submission that are publicly available (on arXiv, as a technical report, etc.) should NOT be cited in the submission, as this would identify the authors. Instead, these prepublications must be listed in the appropriate field of the submission form, titled “Prepublication.” This field is not visible to reviewers. 
  Ethics   
  Computer graphics have an increasing societal impact. Authors should be aware of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct  and adhere to it. Authors should also adhere to the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  if human subjects are involved in their research. The Technical Papers Committee will judge each submission solely based on its technical merits and novelty. If a submission that the Technical Papers Committee recommends to accept raises an ethical issue, it will be forwarded to a relevant ACM body for ethics evaluation. This body can recommend changes to the submission or, in extreme cases, rejecting the work. The Technical Papers chair will take the final decision in these cases.   
 Lobbying Reviewers   
  It is strictly prohibited to make any attempt to intervene in the review process. For example, it is inappropriate for an author to contact a committee member or a person they suspect to be a reviewer during the review process and mention the author’s own submission, even if the author does not explicitly ask for a favor. Committee members and reviewers will be asked to report such incidents and subsequently may be marked as conflicted and removed from the review process for that submission. For the most serious interventions, the submission may be rejected without completing the review process.

 Submission Requirements  
  Submission Format   
  Technical Papers authors should prepare their documents according to the ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines  . All submissions should be prepared in ACM double-column format. For convenience, we recommend using the provided “acmtog”  LaTeX Article Template Style  , which is already in the correct format. The other templates (e.g., Word, Overleaf) might need adaptation to obtain double-column format.  Please pay particular attention to the citation format for prior ACM SIGGRAPH conference papers, as specified in the ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines, because the proper format varies depending on the year of publication.  
 If you use LaTeX, please anonymize your initial submission with the following \documentclass  command:  
 \documentclass[acmtog,anonymous,review]{acmart}   and add your assigned paper ID with:  
 Please use the same formatting for both Journal-only and dual-track submissions. For dual-track submissions, please follow the instructions in the section below regarding paper length and organization. Papers that do not conform to these instructions will not be considered for the conference track and may be desk rejected.  
 Authors are required to submit fully formatted papers, with graphs, images, and other special areas arranged as intended for final publication, using the ACM SIGGRAPH paper preparation guidelines. Be sure that all pages are numbered and contain your paper’s ID number. You should obtain this paper ID by completing the Online Submission Form before finalizing your paper. If your paper is accepted, you will receive instructions for formatting the final version, which will be different because, among other things, the authors’ names and affiliations will be included, and the pages will not be numbered.  
 Preserving Anonymity in the Submission   
  Remove any information from your submission materials (paper, video, images, data, code, etc.) that identifies you, any of the other authors, and any of your institutions or places of work. In addition to not listing your names and affiliations in the paper, please omit acknowledgements (you will be able to add them back upon acceptance). If you are a well-known author, don’t narrate your video; get someone else to do it. You must reference all relevant work completely, including your own and that of the other authors. The detailed policy on how to cite these papers, including prepublications (arXiv, technical reports, etc.), theses, submitted work, and published work, is described in the “Citing Own Prior Art” section in the Submission Policy. Please read the instructions carefully before submitting your work.  
 Do not include URLs referring to websites that contain vital material for your submission. Such material won’t be considered due to the fact that reviewers cannot access it without endangering the anonymity of the reviewing process.  
 Please keep the PDF version anonymous; in particular, note that under some operating systems the “properties” of a PDF file may contain the creator’s name. Also, Version 7 PDF files allow inclusion of a script that will contact the author each time the file is opened. Do not include this script in your PDF file; if we find it, we will reject your paper without review. Make sure that no submitted files contain any information about the authors in the metadata.  
 Paper Length   
  Journal-only submissions have no maximum (or minimum) length. Have a look at previous proceedings to get a sense of the range of paper lengths, where typical lengths are between 8 and 12 pages, not including references, though the variation is large. For Journal Papers that are conditionally accepted, the final paper length may increase when approved by the primary reviewer.  
 Dual track submissions are required to adhere to the following length constraints: Papers must be no longer than 7 pages excluding references and figures-only pages. There is no limit on the length of the reference section. Each paper can have at most two figures-only pages, placed at the end of the submission, after references.  Authors can also include as many figures as they wish within the core 7 pages. Papers should not include appendices in the main document.  Any appendix should only be included as supplementary material. Papers will not be considered for conference publication if they exceed the page limit, are not submitted using the formatting described in the section “Submission Format,” or appear to alter the format to bypass the page limit. Post-acceptance, authors of papers accepted to the Conference track can add one additional page to the final-format papers to accommodate the author list, author affiliations, copyright, and acknowledgements (no other content should be added, i.e., the anonymous version still needs to fulfill the length requirements discussed before).  
 The submitted paper should stand on its own, allowing evaluation of the main ideas without reliance on supplemental material. For example, main results and discussion of the method must be in the submission; extra ablation studies, additional comparisons, implementation details, and similar material can be provided in the supplemental material. Animated results may be included as an accompanying video.  
 For all submissions, clarity of writing is considered vital to a high-quality submission. Papers may be perceived as too long if they are repetitive or verbose or too short if they omit important details or neglect relevant prior art.  
 Companion Videos   
  Papers may be accompanied by a video that is five minutes or less in duration. In recent years, well over half of the accepted papers were accompanied by some kind of video material. To the extent possible, accepted papers should stand on their own, with the video providing supplementary information or visual confirmation of results. However, it is fine to refer to the video in the paper, in which case the video should be submitted under Supplementary Materials, part A in the submission form, as described below. A video should not be included in a submission unless substantively similar footage can later publicly appear in the ACM Digital Library. If your paper is accepted and you cannot comply with this requirement because of copyright or permission problems, your paper’s acceptance will be rescinded.  
 Supplemental Materials   
  Authors are invited, but not required, to include supplemental materials such as additional implementation details, ablations, comparisons, additional images or videos, related papers, derivations, or results, as well as code and data files (so that reviewers can reproduce results in the paper). These materials will be viewed only at the discretion of the reviewers, who are only obligated to read the paper itself.  These materials must be anonymized, so that they can be made available to all reviewers. There are two separate parts in the online submission form for uploading supplementary materials:  
 A) Anonymous supplemental materials that are considered part of the submission, and that you are committing to provide for the ACM Digital Library if your paper is accepted.  
 B) Anonymous materials that you are submitting to help in the review process but do not plan to submit to the Digital Library.  
 For instance, in addition to videos, A) may include some code, and a .zip archive containing result images and some text files, such as detailed user-study results or other appendices associated to your submission. B) may include anonymized versions of related papers from the same authors currently under review or in press elsewhere, together with an anonymous cover letter that outlines the differences between the submission and these other papers. In case of resubmission with reviewer continuity, the cover letter explaining how you took into account previous reviews and listing the improvements in your method should be there, too.  
 Resubmissions   
  If your paper is a revision of a paper that has previously been submitted to a SIGGRAPH or SIGGRAPH Asia conference, we recommend (but do not require) that when you fill out the submission form you identify it as a resubmission, and select the option that allows the previous review materials (reviews, reviewer discussions, summaries, etc.) to be made available to the Technical Papers Committee. Please indicate the latest conference that your paper was submitted to and its paper ID at the time. If you choose to use this option, your paper may be assigned to some or all of the previous reviewers, and all reviewers will have access to suitably anonymized versions of the prior review materials. We encourage you to choose this option if you consider the paper to be derived from the previous version, even if the paper has been substantially rewritten and authors have been added. It will result in more consistent reviews and decrease the chance that a new set of reviewers will want completely different changes than those you made in response to the reviews of your earlier submissions. This option also has the added side benefit of reducing the overall burden on the volunteer reviewing community. Note that simply responding to all earlier criticisms will not guarantee acceptance. If you resubmit with reviewer continuity, you should include a cover letter within the anonymous supplementary materials, part B, in order to explain the changes you made to the paper and how you improved your work and its exposition since the last review cycle. If you resubmit without continuity, you may still choose to submit a similar anonymous cover letter to make it easier for recurring reviewers to understand the changes that have been made since the previous submission.  
 Permissions and Copyrights   
  You must have permission from the owner or copyright holder to use any images or video (or provide rationale for using them without permission) that you do not own in your submitted paper or supplementary material. ACM has a clear policy and procedures for handling third-party material  . If your submission is accepted, you will be asked to provide a signed rights form, which is required by ACM before your paper can be published. The contact author of each paper will receive an email message from ACM Rights Review containing instructions and a link to the rights form, which is completed online.  
 Authors of accepted Technical Papers are required to complete the ACM Rights Form prior to publication. They also are required to upload final versions of all public supplementary materials (Part A) that were originally part of their submission.  
 Back to Top    
 Evaluation  
  The Technical Papers Committee and a set of external reviewers, both consisting of recognized experts, will review submitted papers. Then, at the committee meeting, the committee will select the papers to be presented at SIGGRAPH 2023 and published in either a special issue of ACM Transactions on Graphics  or in the SIGGRAPH Conference Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Both Journal-only and dual-track submissions will be reviewed by the same Technical Papers Committee. The Technical Papers Chair will work with the Technical Papers Committee and the tertiary reviewers to evaluate each valid submission.  
 The Review Process   
 After the submission deadline, the Technical Papers Chair and several others selected by the Technical Papers Chair will conduct the papers sort. During this meeting, they assign each paper to two senior reviewers, called the primary and secondary reviewers, who are members of the Technical Papers Committee. Additionally, each submission is assigned a COI Coordinator. All parties participating in the review process enter their conflict of interest data into the submission system ahead of time. The Technical Papers Chair does not make assignments or review papers. Rather, it is the job of the chair to facilitate the process. Papers that are inappropriate may be rejected during this assignment process without being sent to any senior reviewers. Papers will normally be rejected at this stage only if they are clearly off topic for SIGGRAPH 2023 or if they are discovered to have been published previously or to have been submitted simultaneously to another conference or journal. For more details, see | Submission Policy | and | Frequently Asked Questions | . 
  The two assigned senior reviewers may, upon conferring with each other and the Technical Papers Chair, recommend a paper to be rejected without additional review. A paper will normally be rejected at this stage only if it falls into one of the categories listed in phase one, but this fact was not detected during the papers sort. 
  Each paper is distributed to three or more additional experts, called tertiary reviewers. Two of them are selected by the primary senior reviewer of that paper, and the third is selected by the secondary senior reviewer. The identity of the authors is not revealed to any of the reviewers. The primary and the secondary reviewer are warned by the submission system, Linklings, if their selection of tertiary reviewers would result in a conflict of interest. In addition, the assigned COI Coordinator does see the identity of the authors and approves the tertiary reviewers selected by the primary and the secondary reviewer after verifying that there is no COI in the assignment. The primary, secondary, and tertiary reviewers all write full reviews. See the | Review Form | and | Reviewer Instructions | . Thus, at least five reviews are written for each paper that has not been rejected during phases one and two. In unusual cases, such as when a tertiary reviewer fails to deliver a review on time, papers may receive only four reviews. However, if a paper receives fewer than four reviews, additional reviewers will be found, possibly from the committee. For more details, see the | Review Process | section in the | Technical Papers FAQ | . 
  Between the end of the rebuttal period and the committee meeting, the senior reviewers will read the author rebuttals, confer intensively about the paper, and prepare a recommendation for the committee meeting. The three tertiary reviewers will see the author rebuttals and will participate in discussions about the paper. Due to the double-blind review process, the authors must maintain anonymity in their rebuttals. In addition, the tertiary reviewers do not know each other’s identities, so they too must maintain anonymity during the discussion. The preliminary recommendation agreed on at this stage will be either “conditionally accepted” or “rejected.” If an agreement on the recommendation cannot be reached, a third option is to “table” the paper for further review and discussion during the final Technical Papers Committee meeting. 
  If a paper is tabled, the senior reviewers will select one or more other members of the Technical Papers Committee to write extra reviews of the paper and be prepared to discuss it in detail at the meeting. The extra reviews will be written during the week before the committee meeting. If consensus still cannot be reached, it is even possible that extra reviews will be assigned during the meeting itself. Any extra reviews will be provided to the authors after the meeting. 
  The full Technical Papers Committee meets to finalize conditional acceptance or rejection of each paper. In cases where a consensus on a paper was not reached during the pre-meeting discussion phase, additional committee members may read the paper, and their evaluations will be taken into account in the decision. Submissions will either be accepted as a Journal Paper or a Conference Paper. 
  Members of the Technical Papers Committee, including the chair, leave the room when papers for which they have conflicts of interest are discussed. Papers are judged solely on their merit, as determined by the reviews. Although the acceptance rate of SIGGRAPH papers has remained stable in the range of ~20-30%, there is no quota for the number of papers that should be accepted by the SIGGRAPH 2023 Technical Papers Committee; this number will arise organically from the actions of the committee.  
 Possible Outcomes for a Paper   
  Email notifications of the Technical Papers Committee’s decisions will be sent following the committee meeting (see the Timeline  below). The notifications will place each paper in one of the following categories.  
 Conditionally accepted Journal Paper for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2023. | The committee provides a list of required changes that must be performed to the paper for the work to be published. 
  Conditionally accepted Conference Paper for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2023. | The committee provides a list of required changes that must be performed to the paper for the work to be published, limited to minor writing changes that are satisfiable within the current page limits and without requiring new experiments. 
  Rejected from SIGGRAPH 2023. | Submissions that were deemed not suitable for the conference, or too flawed or incomplete to be accepted, will be rejected. In some cases, the reviewers may find enough merit in the submission that they encourage the authors to consider resubmitting to either | ACM Transactions on Graphics | or a future SIGGRAPH conference, with reviewer continuity. The review summary includes a set of suggested changes. 
  Conditionally accepted papers undergo a second reviewing process, in which a member of the Technical Papers Committee verifies that the final version of the paper is acceptable, i.e., that any required changes have been made, and that other changes made by the authors have not compromised the paper in any way. This second and final stage determines the final acceptance status of all papers. The referees’ decisions are final. Papers that do not satisfy the referees in the second stage of reviewing and/or that are not uploaded in final form by the final deadline, together with the original or revised versions of the submitted supplementary material, will be rejected. One author of the paper must commit to presenting the paper in person at the SIGGRAPH 2023 conference.  
 Back to Top    
 Upon Acceptance  
  Authors of papers conditionally accepted by the committee must revise their submission for the second round of reviewing and deliver that material to Linklings. Once the reviewers have approved the paper, authors will finalize the preparation of their camera-ready paper and deliver the source of that paper, and any supplemental materials, to TAPS for publication. Accepted Conference Papers will appear in the conference proceedings, and Journal Papers will be published as a special issue of ACM Transactions on Graphics  .  
 TAPS is ACM’s article processing system, which accepts LaTeX or Word source documents and prepares the formatted PDF and HTML5 versions of one’s article for publication in the ACM Digital Library. The use of TAPS replaces the need for authors to prepare and deliver “camera-ready” materials to Linklings. Information on preparing and delivering materials to TAPS can be found here  .  
 Notification of conditional acceptances and rejections will be sent to authors, along with any extra reviews and possibly a list of required changes (see Timeline  below). A member of the Technical Papers Committee, typically the primary reviewer, will be assigned as referee for the revision cycle.  
 The deadlines for the revised version and final version of your paper are listed in the Timeline below. During the week between these two dates, the referees and authors will communicate via the bulletin board process about the adequacy of the changes in the revisions. Sometimes, changes are not initially considered adequate, or introduce new problems, so further revision may be required. It is recommended to submit the initial revised version sooner than the deadline in order to provide more time for iterated revisions. It is hoped that all conditionally accepted papers will be accepted by the end of this process, but this is not guaranteed. When writing successive revisions, the referee’s job is made easier if authors use a different color for the added or revised text in each new version. (Please remember to remove these colors in the final version.) It also helps to describe the changes in the bulletin board post to which the revision is attached.  
 ORCID Mandate   
  ACM now requires that all accepted journal authors  register and provide ACM with valid ORCID identifiers prior to paper publication. Corresponding authors are responsible for collecting these ORCID identifiers from co-authors and providing them to ACM as part of the ACM eRights selection process.  
 In-Person Presentation   
  For each accepted paper, one author is required to present on-site in Los Angeles, 6–10 August 2023. Following the presentation, they are expected to answer public questions from the audience if those arise and participate in a poster session where they will have the opportunity to interact with participants in a more intimate setting. Additional information will be provided upon acceptance.  
 We have simplified the post-acceptance process this year! Pre-recorded video presentations are no longer required. All presentations will be made live, in-person in Los Angeles.  
 Authors should plan to present from their own personal laptops. SIGGRAPH will provide adapters needed to connect personal computers to the session projector.  
 Presenter Recognition   
  To present your work at SIGGRAPH 2023, at least one contributor per submission must register at the appropriate registration level.  
 You can find a link to the contributor recognition policy here   .  
 Authorization for Use   
  Any material that supports a paper’s acceptance for publication must be available as part of the final publication ( see Submission Requirements  ). Thus, all material uploaded for review in the “public materials that are considered part of the submission” section of the submission form, including supplementary text, images, and videos, are subject to the ACM copyright policy, and the required permission forms must be completed upon acceptance. If it subsequently becomes apparent that the necessary permissions cannot be given for publication of material that is substantially similar to that submitted for review, acceptance of the paper may be withdrawn. Upon acceptance, authors must deliver final versions of their papers and their supplementary material, which will be made available to subscribers to the ACM Digital Library via the web page associated with their TOG papers.  
 Please be aware that ACM has updated its copyright policy to give authors the options of retaining copyrights on some materials or to pay fees that enable free access. You can read about the policy here  or a more concise summary here  . Authors of accepted Technical Papers are required to complete the ACM Copyright Form prior to publication. For every supplemental file originally uploaded as part of your submission, you must upload either copies of the originally submitted material (now in non-anonymized form) or updated versions of this material to the online submission system’s final versions page ( see the Timeline below for the deadline  ).  
 Technical Papers Preview Trailer   
  A Technical Papers Preview Trailer will be prepared from selected parts of the videos accompanying accepted papers. The preview will appear in the Electronic Theater at the conference and may also be used to publicize the Technical Papers program inside and outside the conference, like on the web. If a section of your video is selected, you will be asked to provide a high-quality rendering of that clip. Therefore, if you submit a video accompanying your paper, please keep your raw data available for that purpose.  
 Technical Papers Fast Forward   
  In addition to the material that is part of your publication, you will be asked to provide a short presentation for the Technical Papers Fast Forward. The authors will be allowed 20 seconds to summarize the paper and entice attendees to attend their complete paper presentation during the conference week. See the Timeline  below for the deadline for the Fast Forward pre-recorded video.  
 ACM Rights Management Form   
  If your work is accepted for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2023, you must complete the ACM Rights Management Form. The form will be sent to all submitters whose work is accepted.  
  Your representative image and text may be used for promotional purposes. Several SIGGRAPH 2023 programs may prepare preview videos for pre-conference promotion of accepted content, which may include a portion of the video you submitted for review. You have the option to grant or deny us the ability to use the representative image and submitted video for these purposes.

The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.
