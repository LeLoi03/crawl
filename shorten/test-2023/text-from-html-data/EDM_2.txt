 It is a pleasure to invite you to Educational Data Mining (EDM 2023). Educational Data Mining is a leading international forum for high-quality research that mines datasets to answer educational research questions, including exploring how people learn and how they teach. The overarching goal of the Educational Data Mining research community is to support learners and teachers more effectively, by developing data-driven understandings of the learning and teaching processes in a wide variety of contexts and for diverse learners. The conference will take place in the Indian Institute of Science Campus, Bengaluru, India, during July 11-14, 2023.
