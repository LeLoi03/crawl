JURIX 2023   
 Maastricht, the Netherlands  
  18-20 December 2023  
 About the Event  
 For more than 30 years, the JURIX conference has provided an international forum for research on the intersection of Law, Artificial Intelligence, and Information Systems, under the auspices of the JURIX Foundation for Legal Knowledge Systems.  
 JURIX is dedicated to exploring recent advancements, challenges, and opportunities of technologies applied to legal and para-legal activities. We invite submissions of original papers on legal information, legal knowledge systems, artificial intelligence and law, computational and socio-technical approaches to law, covering foundations, methods, tools, systems, interfaces, and applications. Papers should demonstrate added value, novelty of contribution and/or analysis, significance of the work, (formal) validity and/or proper evaluation.  
 The proceedings of the conferences will be published in the Frontiers of Artificial Intelligence and Applications series of IOS Press. JURIX follows the Golden Standard and provides one of the best dissemination platforms in AI & law.  
 Please note that presenters of papers accepted to the main conference are expected to be on-site to give their presentations and to interact with the audience. An online streaming option will be set-up for remote observers. Workshops may however run hybrid, at the discretion of their organizers (for further information, see their websites).
