 We invite you to the 22nd IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR), which will be held from October 16 to 20, 2023 in Sydney, Australia.    
 IEEE ISMAR is the premier conference for Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR) and Virtual Reality (VR), which attracts the world’s leading researchers from both academia and industry. ISMAR explores the advances in commercial and research activities related to AR, MR, and VR by continuing the expansion of its scope over the past several years. The conference is planned to include two days of workshops, tutorials, and contests, and three days of presentations of scientific papers, posters, and demonstrations. In addition, exhibitions will be arranged to promote the interactions and exchange between industry and academia.   
 ISMAR 2023 is planned to be hosted in hybrid mode. We look forward to seeing all of you in Sydney.   
 Information about the sessions, including Zoom links, is provided on the conference slack server. Please contact  online_experience_chairs@ismar  23.org  if you have missed the invitation email.
