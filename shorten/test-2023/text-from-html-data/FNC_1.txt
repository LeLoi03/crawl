 Scope & Topics   
 18 th  18th International Conference on Future Networks and Communications (FNC 2023)  Cloud is a modern computing platform for delivering on-demand computing services to service consumers over the Internet. Computing services include, for example, storage, memory, compute power, databases, and networking among others. Cloud services are generally provided using SaaS (Software-as-a-Service), PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) and IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service). Unlike conventional distributed computing, cloud offers flexibility, scalability, efficiency and elasticity in service provisioning. In addition to the traditional topic areas of FiCloud 2023 listed below, papers are also solicited for a new track on “IoT and Smart Systems”.
