 The IUI is a conference where the latest research on user interface technologies is discussed. The headline for this years conference was “Where HCI meets AI”. So a large majority of the presented papers, posters and demos are on using artificial intelligence (AI) for improving user interfaces, including topics such as accessibility, understanding contexts and autonomous systems communication with humans (human computer interaction). The conference website description is as follows:  
 “ACM IUI 2023 is the 28th annual meeting of the intelligent interfaces community and serves as a premier international forum for reporting outstanding research and development on intelligent user interfaces. ACM IUI is where the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community meets the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community. We are also very interested in contributions from related fields, such as psychology, behavioral science, cognitive science, computer graphics, design, the arts, etc.”  
 The conference is relatively small in comparison to other ACM conferences I visited, but this is actually quite good, because you don’t have to decide which session you want to visit. Everything takes place in one large room and you won’t miss any interesting presentation. Another thing that I liked about the organization was, that many presentation and workshop were hybrid. So it was possible to join a session from remote. So overall a very good and interesting conference.
