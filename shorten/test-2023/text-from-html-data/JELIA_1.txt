 About JELIA 2023  
 Welcome to JELIA 2023, the 18th edition of the European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence, to be held in Dresden by the International Center for Computational Logic of TU Dresden   .  
 Logics have, for many years, laid claim to providing a formal basis for the study and development of applications and systems in Artificial Intelligence. With the depth and maturity of formalisms, methodologies and logic-based systems today, this claim is stronger than ever.  
 The increasing interest in this forum, its international level with growing participation from researchers outside Europe, and the overall technical quality, has turned JELIA into a major biennial forum for the discussion of logic-based approaches to artificial intelligence.
