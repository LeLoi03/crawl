 Call for paper for the DAM special issue dedicated to ISCO 2022     
 ISCO (International Symposium on C  ombinatorial Optimization)  is a biennial symposium whose aim is to bring together researchers from all the communities related to combinatorial optimization, including algorithms and complexity, mathematical programming, operations research, optimization under uncertainty, graphs and combinatorics. It is intended to be a forum for presenting original research in these areas and especially in their intersections. Quality papers on all aspects of combinatorial optimization, from mathematical foundations and theory of algorithms to computational studies and practical applications, are solicited.    
 This seventh issue will be held online.   
 ISCO 2022 conference will be preceded by a Spring School  which is dedicated to PhD students but the lectures are also open to other colleagues.
