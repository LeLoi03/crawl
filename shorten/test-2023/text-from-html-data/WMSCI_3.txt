 Monthly Featured   
 The World Multi-Conference on Society, Cybernetics and Informatics (WMSCI)  , 1) ATTENTION!…   formerly the World Conference on Systemics, Cybernetics, and Informatics (SCI) and the International Conference on Information Systems Analysis and Synthesis (ISAS), is organized by the International Institute of Informatics and Systemics (IIIS). The conference is an international forum for scientists and engineers, researchers and consultants, theoreticians and practitioners in the fields of Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics. The forum focuses into specific disciplinary research, and also in multi-, inter-, and trans-disciplinary studies and projects. One of its aims is to relate disciplines, fostering analogical thinking and, hence, producing input to the logical thinking.  
 WMSCI is organized in conjunction with the International Multi-Conference on Society, Cybernetics and Informatics (IMSCI) and the Conferencia Iberoamericana en Sistemas, Cibernética e Informática (CISCI).
