  ISCO 2024 | What is ISCO?   
  ISCO (Integer Symposium on Combinatorial Optimization) is a biannual symposium whose aim is to bring together researchers from all the communities related to combinatorial optimization, including algorithms and complexity, mathematical programming, operations research, stochastic optimization, graphs and combinatorics. Quality papers on all aspects of combinatorial optimization, from mathematical foundations and theory of algorithms to computational studies and practical applications, are solicited.  
 Each ISCO conference is preceded or followed by a Spring School lectured by international Combinatorial Optimization searches. This school is dedicated to PhD students but the lectures are also opened to older colleagues.  
 Scope of ISCO   
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Approximation algorithms 
    The seventh  issue has be held online in May 2022  , due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This version has been organised with a French team directed by Ivana Ljubic and Pierre Fouilhoux. The spring school was titled "An introduction to quantum algorithms for optimization" wuth Giacomo Nannicini from the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, USA.  
  A special issue in Discrete Applied Mathematics (DAM) 2022 DAM special issue  has been dedicated to the 2022 edition.  
    The heigth  issue will be held in Tenerife, Spain in May 2024  (see website  ) organized with colleague of La Laguna around Juan José Salazar González. The sprinf school will focus on Combinatorial Optimization and Machine Learning with Amitabh Basu from Johns Hopkins University, USA, and Andrea Lodi from Cornell Tech and Technion, New York, USA.  
 Steering Comittee   
 The ISCO steering comittee is  
 Mourad Baiou (LIMOS, University Clermont Auvergne, France) 
  Pierre Fouilhoux (LIPN, University Sorbonne Paris Nord, France) 
  Giovanni Rinaldi (IASI, Roma, Italy) 
  The french members of the steering comittee are also members of the french POC  research group from CNRS.
