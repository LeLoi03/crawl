International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME)  
  - Resources site - 
 The ICSM conference is the premier international (world wide) event in the maintenance field. The importance of software maintenance is being increasingly recognised, both in terms of professional activities and of public perception (the Y2K Millennium bug and the Euro-conversion being the most obvious examples). Hence it is vital for the community of researchers and practitioners to publish, present, and debate the latest results in the field. The ICSM proceedings present works of outstanding international excellence, where reports on the latest advances in the field may be found.  
 Previous ICSM conferences demonstrated tremendous interest and enthusiasm on the part of both researchers and applications personnel for current work in software maintenance. Many excellent papers were submitted and debated, showing that there is increasing interest in the subject.  
 ICSM is truly an international meeting place for researchers and practitioners in the field. Members of the program committee represent many different countries of the world. Many of the authors of papers also represent the software engineering interests of the international community. A main goal of ICSM is to promote interaction between researchers and practitioners. ICSM will bring together researchers, practitioners, developers and users of tools, technology transfer experts, and project managers.  
 Beware of other conferences that call themselves International Conference on Software Maintenance (ICSM), which are not IEEE sponsored or affiliated with ICSME.
