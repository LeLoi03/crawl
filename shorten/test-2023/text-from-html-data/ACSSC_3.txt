Paper Submission Guidelines  
 Final conference papers are reports of the conference presentation and are due after the conference. The IEEE is a technical co-sponsor and post-conference final papers are required to adhere to IEEE publication standards.  As such, final papers should be limited to the work presented during the conference. Methods and material contained should be described in sufficient details to permit evaluation and replication. Toward that goal, final conference papers are expected to include the following elements:
