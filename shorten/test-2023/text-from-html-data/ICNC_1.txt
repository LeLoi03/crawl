 The 2023 14th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD 2023) will be held from 28-30 July 2023 in Huangshan, China.  Huangshan (literal meaning: Yellow Mountain) is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and one of China's major tourist destinations. It is well known for its scenery, sunsets, peculiarly-shaped granite peaks, Huangshan pine trees, hot springs, winter snow, and views of the clouds from above. Huangshan is a frequent subject of traditional Chinese paintings and literature, as well as modern photography. A famous saying goes: "You don't need to see any more mountains after seeing 'the Five Mountains', and you don't need to see the other four mountains after seeing Huangshan."  
 ICNC-FSKD is a premier international forum for scientists and researchers to present the state of the art of data mining and intelligent methods inspired from nature, particularly biological, linguistic, and physical systems with applications to computers, circuits, systems, control, communications  , and more. This is an exciting and emerging interdisciplinary area in which a wide range of theory and methodologies are being investigated and developed to tackle complex and challenging problems. The registration fee includes proceedings, lunches, dinners banquet, coffee breaks, and all technical sessions.  
 Prospective authors are invited to submit manuscripts written in English. All submissions will be peer-reviewed by experts in the field based on originality, significance, quality and clarity. Authors should use the Latex style files or MS-Word templates obtained from the conference site to format their papers. Authors should submit PDF files of their manuscripts via the online submission system. Submissions imply that the papers have not been submitted elsewhere and will not be submitted elsewhere for publications before the review decisions of this conference. 
 JOURNAL SPECIAL ISSUE 
 The International Journal of Fuzzy Systems (IJFS) is an official journal of Taiwan Fuzzy Systems Association (TFSA) and is published quarterly. IJFS will consider high quality papers that deal with the theory, design, and application of fuzzy systems, soft computing systems, grey systems, and extension theory systems ranging from hardware to software. Survey and expository submissions are also welcome.
