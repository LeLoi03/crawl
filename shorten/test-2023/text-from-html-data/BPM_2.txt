 This newsletter is a new activity related to the BPM conference series. The goal is to further strengthen the BPM community that formed over the last decade. The newsletter provides you with up-to-date information related to the conference series “International Conference on Business Process Management”.  
 The Steering Committee of the conference series is the only party that is eligible to send messages on this mailing list. You will receive information in a very condensed form. We plan to send a newsletter about twice a year.
