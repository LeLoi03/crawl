 Embodied music interaction, is a broad framework that describe the role of our movement and body in listening, playing or more generally experiencing music. Within this framework, the use of interactive technologies enable opportunities for designing a large variety of systems and instruments. In this talk, I will describe approaches, design methodologies, computational models using machine learning we developed over the years to explore different types of movement-based music interaction. Interestingly, this allows us to consider different perspectives in embodied music interaction such as listening / performing, beginner / virtuoso, solo / collective. I will in particular describe issues in learning and appropriating interactive technologies, ranging from artistic creation to health.
