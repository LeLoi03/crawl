 Trustbus 2023  
 20th International Workshop on Trust, Privacy and Security in the Digital Society  
 to be held in conjunction with the 18 th  International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security  
 August 29 – September 01, 2023   
 New computing paradigms, such as cloud computing, big data or the Internet of Things, open new horizons to citizens, businesses and our whole society worldwide. All these developments ultimately aim to improve our quality of life, make it easier to generate wealth, and ensure that businesses remain competitive in the global marketplace. These developments have been made possible in a remarkably short time span because information and communication technologies move fast; sometimes, they move too fast for society and governments. This explains why such rapid technological evolutions cannot be problem-free. In the domain of a digital society, concerns are raised regarding the lack of trust in electronic procedures and the extent to which information security and user privacy can be ensured.
