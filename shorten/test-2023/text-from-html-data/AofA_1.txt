 Analysis of Algorithms  
 Analysis of Algorithms (AofA) is a field at the boundary of computer science and mathematics. The goal is to obtain a precise understanding of the asymptotic, average-case characteristics of algorithms and data structures. A unifying theme is the use of probabilistic, combinatorial and analytic methods. The objects to be studied include random branching processes, graphs permutations, trees, and strings.
