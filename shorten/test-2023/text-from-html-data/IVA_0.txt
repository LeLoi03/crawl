  The annual conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA) is the premier international event for interdisciplinary research on the design, application, and evaluation of Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVAs) with a specific focus on the ability to socially interact. IVAs are interactive characters that exhibit human-like qualities including communicating using natural human modalities such as facial expressions, speech, and gesture. They are capable of real-time perception, cognition, emotion and action that allow them to participate in dynamic social environments.
