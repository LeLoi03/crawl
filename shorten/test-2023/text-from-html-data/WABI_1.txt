  Abstract    
 Finding a tree with the minimum total distance to a given set of trees (the median tree) is increasingly needed in phylogenetics. Defining tree distance as the number of induced four-taxon unrooted (i.e., quartet) trees with different topologies, the median of a set of gene trees is a statistically consistent estimator of the species tree under several models of gene tree species tree discordance. Because of this, median trees defined with quartet distance are widely used in practice for species tree inference. Nevertheless, the problem is NP-Hard and the widely-used solutions are heuristics. In this paper, we pave the way for a new type of heuristic solution to this problem. We show that the optimal place to add a subtree of size m onto a tree with n leaves can be found in time that grows quasi-linearly with n and is nearly independent of m. This algorithm can be used to perform subtree prune and regraft (SPR) moves efficiently, which in turn enables the hill-climbing heuristic search for the optimal tree. In exploratory experiments, we show that our algorithm can improve the quartet score of trees obtained using the existing widely-used methods.

  Abstract    
 Not only do many biological populations undergo evolution, but population members may also migrate from one location to another. For example, tumor cells may migrate from the primary tumor and seed a new metastasis, and pathogens may migrate from one host to another. One may represent a population’s migration history by labeling the vertices of a given phylogeny T with locations such that an edge incident to vertices with distinct locations represents a migration. Additionally, in some biological populations, taxa from distinct lineages may comigrate from one location to another in a single event, a phenomenon known as a comigration. Here, we show that a previous problem statement for inferring migration histories that are parsimonious in terms of migrations and comigrations may lead to temporally inconsistent solutions. To remedy this deficiency, we introduce precise definitions of temporal consistency of comigrations in a phylogeny, leading to three successive problems. First, we formulate the Temporally Consistent Comigrations (TCC) problem to check if a set of comigrations is temporally consistent and provide a linear time algorithm for solving this problem. Second, we formulate the Parsimonious Consistent Comigration (PCC) problem, which aims to find comigrations given a location labeling of a phylogeny. We show that PCC is NP-hard. Third, we formulate the Parsimonious Consistent Comigration History (PCCH) problem, which infers the migration history given a phylogeny and locations of its extant vertices only. We show that PCCH is NP-hard as well. On the positive side, we propose integer linear programming models to solve the PCC and PCCH problems. We apply our approach to real and simulated data.

  Abstract    
 String indexes such as the suffix array (SA) and the closely related longest common prefix (LCP) array are fundamental objects in bioinformatics and have a wide variety of applications. Despite their importance in practice, few scalable parallel algorithms for constructing these are known, and the existing algorithms can be highly non-trivial to implement and parallelize. In this paper we present CaPS-SA, a simple and scalable parallel algorithm for constructing these string indexes inspired by samplesort. Due to its design, CaPS-SA has excellent memory-locality and thus incurs fewer cache misses and achieves strong performance on modern multicore systems with deep cache hierarchies. We show that despite its simple design, CaPS-SA outperforms existing state-of-the-art parallel SA and LCP-array construction algorithms on modern hardware. Finally, motivated by applications in modern aligners where the query strings have bounded lengths, we introduce the notion of a bounded-context SA and show that CaPS-SA can easily be extended to exploit this structure to obtain further speedups.

  Abstract    
 Motivation. Recurrent substructures in RNA, known as 3D motifs, consist of networks of base pair interactions and are critical to understanding the relationship between structure and function. Their structure is naturally expressed as a graph which has led to many graph-based algorithms to automatically catalog identical motifs found in 3D structures. Yet, due to the complexity of the problem, state-of-the-art methods are often optimized to find exact matches, limiting the search to a subset of potential solutions, or do not allow explicit control over the desired variability. Results. We developed FuzzTree, a method able to efficiently sample approximate instances of an RNA motif, abstracted as a subgraph within a target RNA structure. It is the first method that allows explicit control over (1) the admissible geometric variability in the interactions; (2) the number of missing edges; and (3) the introduction of discontinuities in the backbone given close distances in the 3D structure. Our tool relies on a multidimensional Boltzmann sampling, having complexity parameterized by the treewidth of the requested motif. We applied our method to the well-known internal loop Kink-Turn motif, which can be divided into 12 subgroups. Given only the graph representing the main Kink-Turn subgroup, FuzzTree retrieved over 3/4 of all kink-turns. We also highlighted two occurrences of new sampled patterns. Our tool is available as free software and can be customized for different parameters and types of graphs.

  Abstract    
 The problem of designing an RNA sequence v that encodes for a given target protein w plays an important role in messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine design. Due to codon degeneracy, there exist exponentially many RNA sequences for a single target protein. These candidate RNA sequences may adopt different secondary structure conformations with varying minimum free energy (MFE), affecting their thermodynamic stability and consequently mRNA half-life. In addition, species-specific codon usage bias, as measured by the codon adaptation index (CAI), also plays an essential role in translation efficiency. While previous works have focused on optimizing either MFE or CAI, more recent works have shown the merits of optimizing both objectives. Importantly, there is a trade-off between MFE and CAI, i.e. optimizing one objective is at the expense of the other. Here, we formulate the Pareto Optimal RNA Design problem, seeking the set of Pareto optimal solutions for which no other solution exists that is better in terms of both MFE and CAI. We introduce DERNA (DEsign RNA), which uses the weighted sum method to enumerate the Pareto front by optimizing convex combinations of both objectives. DERNA uses dynamic programming to solve each convex combination in O(|w|³) time and O(|w|²) space. Compared to a previous approach that only optimizes MFE, we show on a benchmark dataset that DERNA obtains solutions with identical MFE but superior CAI. Additionally, we show that DERNA matches the performance in terms of solution quality of LinearDesign, a recent approach that similarly seeks to balance MFE and CAI. Finally, we demonstrate our method’s potential for mRNA vaccine design using SARS-CoV-2 spike as the target protein.

  Abstract    
 One of the most fundamental problems in genome rearrangement is the (genomic) distance problem. It is typically formulated as finding the minimum number of rearrangements under a model that are needed to transform one genome into the other. A powerful multi-chromosomal model is the Double Cut and Join (DCJ) model. While the DCJ model is not able to deal with some situations that occur in practice, like duplicated or lost regions, it was extended over time to handle these cases. First, it was extended to the DCJ-indel model, solving the issue of lost markers. Later ILP-solutions for so called natural genomes, in which each genomic region may occur an arbitrary number of times, were developed, enabling in theory to solve the distance problem for any pair of genomes. However, some theoretical and practical issues remained unsolved. On the theoretical side of things, there exist two disparate views of the DCJ-indel model, motivated in the same way, but with different conceptualizations that could not be reconciled so far. On the practical side, while the solutions for natural genomes typically perform well on telomere to telomere resolved genomes, they have been shown in recent years to quickly loose performance on genomes with a large number of contigs or linear chromosomes. This has been linked to a particular technique increasing the solution space superexponentially named capping. Recently, we introduced a new conceptualization of the DCJ-indel model within the context of another rearrangement problem. In this manuscript, we will apply this new conceptualization to the distance problem. In doing this, we uncover the relation between the disparate conceptualizations of the DCJ-indel model. We are also able to derive an ILP solution to the distance problem that does not rely on capping and therefore significantly improves upon the performance of previous solutions for genomes with high numbers of contigs while still solving the problem exactly. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first allowing for an exact computation of the DCJ-indel distance for natural genomes with large numbers of linear chromosomes. We demonstrate the performance advantage as well as limitations in comparison to an existing solution on simulated genomes as well as showing its practical usefulness in an analysis of 11 Drosophila genomes.
