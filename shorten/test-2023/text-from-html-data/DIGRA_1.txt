   Conferences  
 DiGRA conferences are Digital Games Research Association’s core events that are held annually in changing locations.  
 Upcoming Conference    
 About Our Conferences  
 Our conferences gather several hundred people to share, talk, and debate about games and play – just like any scientists do at their conferences but possibly with a little bit more of fun. Our very first conference ‘Level Up’ was organised over 20 years ago at Utrecht University in the Netherlands by Joost Raessens, Marinka Copier, Jeffrey Goldstein, and Frans Mäyrä. Our future, meanwhile, is up to you! Around once a year, you can find a new call for conference hosts in our news section  . We are always on the lookout for research groups to bid us their location!  
 Our Next Conference  
 June 30th – July 4 th    
 Valletta, Malta   
 The theme of the conference will be Games at the Crossroads, exploring games and game studies at points of (cultural, disciplinary) encounter and divergence.
