   Conference Call for Papers  
 Specific topics of interest to RAID include, but are not limited to:  
  Computer, network, and cloud computing security  
  Intrusion detection system (31.07%) 
  The aim of Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection is to expand the discussion of research in Computer security, Intrusion detection system, Malware, Data mining and Anomaly detection. The research on Computer security featured in the event combines topics in other fields like Software, The Internet, Host (network) and Internet privacy. Intrusion detection system research featured in Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection incorporates concerns from various other topics such as Computer network, Real-time computing and Embedded system.  
 The works on Computer network deal in particular with Network packet. The presentations focused mostly on Malware in an attempt to further explore topics in Operating system. The study on Data mining presented is investigated in conjunction with research in Set (abstract data type).  
 Artificial intelligence research discussed connects with the study of Pattern recognition.  
 What are the most cited papers published at the conference?  
  Research areas of the most cited articles at Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection:  
 The published papers primarily tackle Intrusion detection system, Computer security, Data mining, Malware and Anomaly detection. While work presented in the most cited articles provide substantial information on Intrusion detection system, it also covers topics in Real-time computing, Network security and Network packet. The Exploit studies presented in the conference articles fall under the field of Computer security, but they also have connections to other fields such as Context (language use).  
 What topics the last edition of the conference is best known for?  
 Operating system 
  Computer network 
  The previous edition focused in particular on these issues:  
 The scientific interests tackled in Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection are Computer security, Cloud computing, Operating system, Malware and Android (operating system). While the event primarily focused on Computer security, it also opened dialogues on the discipline of Extortion. Some problems in Cloud computing that were presented in Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection overlapped with concepts under Virtual device, Distributed computing, Test case and Internet privacy.  
 Many of the research works in Operating system, specifically Hypervisor, Cloud computing security and Plaintext, closely connected to disciplines like Cold boot attack and Secure input and output handling. While it focused on Malware, it was also able to explore topics like Anomaly detection and Root cause. While work presented in Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection provided substantial information on Android (operating system), it also covered topics in Exploit, JavaScript and Implementation.  
 The most cited articles from the last conference are:  
  CFI CaRE: Hardware-Supported Call and Return Enforcement for Commercial Microcontrollers (28 citations) 
  Papers citation over time  
 A key indicator for each conference is its effectiveness in reaching other researchers with the papers published at that venue.

 Publication chance based on affiliation  
 The publication chance index shows the ratio of articles published by the best research institutions at the conference edition to all articles published within that conference. The best research institutions were selected based on the largest number of articles published during all editions of the conference.  
 Returning Authors Index  
 A very common phenomenon observed among researchers publishing scientific articles is the intentional selection of conferences they have already attended in the past. In particular, it is worth analyzing the case when the authors participate in the same conference from year to year.  
 The Returning Authors Index presented below illustrates the ratio of authors who participated in both a given as well as the previous edition of the conference in relation to all participants in a given year.

 The experience to innovation index  
 Our experience to innovation index was created to show a cross-section of the experience level of authors publishing at a conference. The index includes the authors publishing at the last edition of a conference  , grouped by total number of publications throughout their academic career (P) and the total number of citations of these publications ever received (C).  
 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups:  
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25),
