 Note that for ALL submissions, the review process is double blind  , which requires the paper and all supplemental materials to be anonymous. Ensure that self-referencing is anonymous (refer to your full name rather than “I” or “we”). Avoid providing information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgements (e.g. co-workers and grant IDs) and in the supplemental material (e.g. titles in the movies, or attached papers). Avoid providing links to websites that identify the authors. Violation of any of these guidelines will lead to rejection without review.
