 APORS 2022  
 ASOR 2022  
 Due to the proximity of APORS 2022 and MODSIM/ASOR 2023, ASOR will be holding a workshop-style conference in late 2022, rather than a conference made up of presentations. More information to come.  
 MODSIM/ASOR 2023  
 Past Conferences  
 ASOR is a member of IFORS, through the Asia-Pacific OR Societies (APORS).  
  ASOR will once again offer a Student Presentation Prize for the ASOR/DORS stream at the conference. Students, please do make sure we know you are in contention, by emailing info@asor.org   before the conference. We are good, but not perfect, at identifying who is and isn't a student based on the conference program. Three aspects with equal weight - presentation style, presentation structure, and presentation scientific/technical content - will form the basis of our selection of prize winner.
