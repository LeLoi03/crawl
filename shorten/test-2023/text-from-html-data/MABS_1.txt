  ABOUT MABS  
 MABS 2023 is part of the AAMAS 2023 conference taking place in London, UK on  
  May 30, 2023.  
 The meeting of researchers from Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) engineering,  
  simulation, and the social, economic, and organizational sciences is extensively  
  from these fields has undoubtedly been an important source of inspiration for  
  the body of knowledge that has been produced in the area.  
 The MABS workshop series continues with its goal to bring together researchers  
  interested in MAS engineering and simulation, with researchers focused on  
  understanding and finding efficient solutions to model complex social and  
  exploration and testing of hypotheses, investigating better designs and systems.  
 TOPICS OF INTEREST  
 We welcome paper submissions from all areas of multi-agent-based simulation and  
  particularly also of work in early stages, which can benefit from active  
  discussions!  
 The range of technical issues that MABS has dealt with, and continues to deal  
  with, is quite diverse and extensive. Topics relevant to this workshop include,  
  but are not limited to:  
  *   Simulation   methodologies   and   tools   -   Standards   for   MABS   -   Methodologies   and   modeling   formalism   for   MABS   -   Methodologies   to   combine   MABS   with   other   modeling   approaches   -   Simulation   languages  ,   platforms   and   tools   for   MABS   -   Large  -  scale   and   distributed   MABS   -   Scalability   and   robustness   in   MABS   -   Future   challenges   in   MABS  *   Simulation   of   Social   and   Intelligent   behavior   -   Formal   and   agent   models   of   social   behavior   -   Cognitive   modeling   and   simulation   -   Game   theory   and   simulation   -   Social   structure  ,   social   networks   and   simulating   organizations   -   Simulating   social   complexity   (  e  .  g  .   structures   and   norms  ,   social   order  ,   emergence   of   cooperation   and   coordinated   action  ,   self  -  organization  ,   the   micro  -  macro   link  )  *   Applications   and   Empirical   Work   -   MABS   for   socio  -  ecological   systems   -   MABS   for   socio  -  technical   systems   -   Agent  -  based   experimental   economics   -   Participatory   and   Human  -  in  -  the  -  Loop   simulation   -   MABS   and   games   -   MABS   and   cloud   computing   -   MABS   in   governance   and   policy  -  making  *   Simulation   Analytics   -   Visualization   and   analytic   tools   for   MABS   -   Experimental   design   for   MABS   -   Statistical   and   data   analysis   methods   for   MABS   -   Data   mining   and   machine   learning   methods   for   MABS      
 MABS is a powerful tool that is being used to inform policy or decisions in  
  many fields of practical importance. The use of models in general, and MABS  
  in particular, during the COVID-19 pandemic has evidenced some of their  
  pitfalls to inform intervention policies. Thus, we propose for 2023 to  
  prioritize submissions of papers that explore how to tackle the pitfalls in  
  using MABS to inform policy making.  
 TARGET AUDIENCE  
 The workshop will provide a forum for social scientists, policy-makers, and  
  researchers committed to cross-cutting research that is complementary to  
  more orthodox modeling approaches.  
 MABS intends to be a place where researchers can exchange ideas about their  
  work and we are looking forward to the community meeting once again in  
  person.
