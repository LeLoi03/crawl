  About IEEE IRI  
  Data science has become the new frontier for self-driving cars and AI. Such intelligent applications derive from Information Reuse and Integration  (IRI). IRI seeks to maximize the utility of information by creating simple, rich, and cost-effective knowledge representations and ontologies. IRI consequently explores strategies for integrating this knowledge into systems and applications. It plays a pivotal role in the capture, representation, maintenance, integration, validation, and extrapolation of information and the knowledge derived from it; and, it applies both information and knowledge for enhancing decision-making in various application domains.  
 This conference explores three major tracks: information reuse  , information integration  , and reusable systems  . Information reuse  explores the theory and practice of optimizing representations; information integration  focuses on innovative strategies and algorithms for unifying diverse information in novel domains; and reusable systems  focus on developing and deploying models and corresponding processes that enable Information Reuse  and Integration  to play a pivotal role in enhancing decision-making processes in various application domains.  
 The IEEE IRI conference serves as a forum for researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to present, discuss, and exchange ideas that address real-world problems with real-world solutions. Theoretical and applied papers are both included. The conference program will include special sessions, open forum workshops, panels, and keynote speeches.
