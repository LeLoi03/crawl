 IAAI-17: The Twenty-Ninth Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence  
  January 29, 2023   
  The Twenty-Ninth Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence (IAAI-17) will be held February 6–9 at the Hilton San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA. The AAAI-17 workshop, tutorial, and doctoral consortium programs will be held Saturday and Sunday, February 4 and 5, followed by the AAAI-17 and IAAI-17 technical programs, Monday through Thursday, February 6–9.  
 IAAI-17 will focus on successful applications of AI technology. The conference will use technical papers, challenge papers, invited talks, and panel discussions to explore issues, methods, and lessons learned in the development and deployment of AI applications; and to promote an interchange of ideas between basic and applied AI. The plan is to have papers in three tracks: (1) deployed application case studies, (2) emerging applications or methodologies, and (3) challenge problem papers. All papers will be original.
