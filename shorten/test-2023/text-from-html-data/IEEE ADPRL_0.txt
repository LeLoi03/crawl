 IEEE Symposium on Adaptive Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning (IEEE ADPRL)  
 Adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) and reinforcement learning (RL) are two related paradigms for solving decision making problems where a performance index must be optimized over time. ADP and RL methods are enjoying a growing popularity and success in applications, fueled by their ability to deal with general and complex problems, including features such as uncertainty, stochastic effects, and nonlinearity.
