  Scope:A new and disruptive paradigm spear-headed by academics and industry experts is taking shape so that applications can leverage resources located at the edge of the network and along the continuum between the cloud and the edge. The Fog/Edge computing paradigm is expected to improve the agility of service deployments, make use of opportunistic and cheap computing, and leverage the network latency and bandwidth diversities between these resources. Numerous challenges arise when using edge resources, which requires the re-examination of operating systems, virtualization and containers, and middleware techniques for fabric management. The conference seeks to attract high-quality contributions covering both theory and practice over system software and domain-specific applications related to next-generation distributed systems that use the edge.
