 iEMSs 2024 at Michigan State University in East Lansing, USA   
 Following a busy day of parallel sessions and workshops, we gathered for an opening reception. For the plenary session on Tuesday, we welcomed Barbara Robson  , Leader of the Tropical Marine Water Quality and Impacts team at the Australian Institute of Marine Science, talking about ‘Assessing model “fitness for purpose” in the context of long-term change’. After a further set of parallel sessions and workshops, the iEMSs committee on Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion met, and conference participants had the opportunity to meet the editors of SESMO  and Environmental Modelling & Software  to ask questions or discuss particular topics.  
 Our final day, Thursday, started without a plenary session, and after several more parallel sessions and workshops, we gathered for a joint lunch and presented the awards for the best student presentations  before closing the 2024 iEMSs biennial conference.  
 #OSIRIS Survey on Computational Reproducibility   
 Researchers of the environmental modelling community are invited to contribute to the important topic of science reproducibility by filling the survey and by providing their views and insights.

  iEMSs 2024 Biennial Conference –   
 Abstract submissions extended to 19 April 2024   
   Call for Abstracts for iEMSs 2024  , abstracts are currently being accepted. Deadline for submission has been extended to 19 April 2024! Submit Abstracts here:  
 Session convenors: please assess all abstracts as they are submitted.  
 To enable travel decisions based on an accepted submission, please consider submitting your abstracts as soon as possible.  
 As a quick reminder and background: the iEMSs Board and Office have decided to move to a model with extended abstracts (max. 2 pages including references)  only. This is because there is substantial additional effort required to manage the review process and to ensure that conference proceedings were edited and made available online open access in an acceptable amount of time. Download figures for full conference papers, and the major hurdles of getting proceedings and full papers of a comparatively smaller conference indexed in Web of Science or Scopus did not justify that effort. In addition, we are publishing SESMO  , our full open access journal, and edit Environmental Modelling and Software  , which provide excellent outlets for full manuscripts which may emerge from iEMSs biennial conferences. Specific communications around opportunities for special issues and general submissions to both journals in the context of iEMSs 2024 as an excellent venue for publishing full manuscripts will be made in due course.  
 Secondly, after working with several different conference management and abstract handling systems over the years, we have decided to invest some efforts in setting up the Open Journal System (OJS), which is used as well to publish SESMO. Along with setting up a persistent conference website as part of the iEMSs domain, the plan is to trial OJS for the 2024 conference, gather feedback and learning points, and if all goes well, we will go with this setup for all future conferences. This will have several benefits, including the ease of generating open access proceedings directly in the iEMSs online presence and close to, if not even before the actual conference. In addition, it would give abstract authors, session organisers and stream convenors the same user experience every time, without the need to adapt to a new system again and again.  
 We will be working with session organisers and stream convenors as we run this new setup for a first time in the run up to June. We may hit a bump or two and experience some hiccups, but the potential advantages operating our own setup will streamline our conference organization in the future and benefit local organisers and scientific committees going forward.

 Takuya Iwanaga   
 Information about the nominated candidate:   
 I am an integrated modeller and research software developer specialising in cross-and-multi disciplinary work to craft systems for holistic and robust integrated decision support under uncertainty. I was awarded the the International Environmental Modelling and Software Society Early Career Researcher award in 2022 for my work on advancing holistic socio-environmental modelling. I am also an associate editor for Environmental Modelling and Software, co-Chair of the Open Modeling Foundation’s Early Career Scholars Working Group, and current Secretary for iEMSs.  
 Reasons why the candidate would be suitable for an iEMSs office or board position and any topical or operational areas of iEMSs they would contribute to:   
 As current Secretary I have been involved in the trial migration to the Open Journal System (OJS) for the iEMSs Conference, and aid in the administration of the Society website.  
 Apart from these duties, I am interested in remaining an active participant in the iEMSs committees such as the ECR committee (of which I am a current member) and potentially joining the Outreach committee as well.  
 The nominated candidate’s previous contributions to iEMSs society activities and advancing the science of environmental modelling and software:   
 To date, I have been involved in organizing sessions (most recently A4 – Tools and software for participatory modeling and decision support). As noted above, I am also supporting the iEMSs conference and trial of the OJS platform.  
 I have (in the past year) changed professional contexts from a terrestrial context to marine (water resources management to reef restoration and adaptation). I have been developing methods and approaches and accompanying tools to aid in holistic decision making under uncertainty in the reef context. Application of these methods and uncertainty considerations are in their relative infancy in this area.
