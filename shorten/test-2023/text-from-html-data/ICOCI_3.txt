  2 Related Work 2.1 Particulate Matter Prediction Models Air pollution is a major environmental concern that significantly impacts public health and the economy. Various techniques have been employed to mitigate air pollution and its related impacts. One approach uses Particulate Matter (PM2.5) prediction models, mathematical and statistical tools to forecast the intensity of fine particulate matter in the air [21]. These models utilize data from various sources, such as satellite imagery, meteorological information, and ground-based measurements of PM2.5 concentrations, to create a spatial and temporal understanding of air pollution. PM2.5 can be emitted from primary sources, such as transportation and industrial activities, or form through secondary sources through chemical reactions with gaseous pollutants. Machine learning models have also been used for PM2.5 prediction, showing promising results. Some of the popular machine learning models employed for PM2.5 prediction are Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) [1, 8], Support Vector Machines (SVMs) [22, 23], Random Forests (RFs) [24, 25], and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs). These models utilize data inputs such as meteorological observations, land use patterns, and satellite images that can help predict PM2.5 concentrations more accurately. It’s worth noting that selecting a model to use in a specific case should be based on the nature of available data and specific prediction goals. Traditional statistical and Machine learning models (ML) have been used in PM2.5 prediction, but they differ in their approaches and assumptions. Conventional statistical models are typically based on predefined algorithms developed using regression analysis or other statistical techniques. These models require that the data meet certain statistical assumptions such as linearity, homoscedasticity, and normal distribution. In contrast, ML models are built on machine learning algorithms that do not involve explicit statistical assumptions. Instead, they learn from data, identifying patterns and relationships without being specifically programmed. They can handle higher-dimensional data, non-linear relationships, and complex data structures. Unlike traditional statistical models, ML models perform better in PM2.5 prediction because they can learn non-linear relationships and assumptions [26]. However, ML models may be considered black-box models that often provide no explanation of how the result was derived and may be difficult to interpret and diagnose. Traditional models are more straightforward, better understand the underlying statistical assumptions, and can be useful in interpreting the nature of the relationship between the predictor and response variable. 2.2 Support Vector Regression Support Vector Regression is a widely held machine learning algorithm to analyze regression based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. It was introduced by Vapnik

  change, transparent, secure, reliable, and trustworthy in public and private environments [6]. The healthcare sector is recognized as one of the sectors that is a possible beneficiary of BCT adoption [7]. Current healthcare systems confront numerous issues, including security, interoperability, privacy, lengthy processes, delays in diagnosis and treatment, difficulties in sharing information, high operational expenses, data control, and data ownership [8, 9]. Health information is fragmented and challenging to exchange due to diverse standards and formats [10]. Institutions often resist sharing data due to privacy concerns and fears of providing competitors with an advantage. The healthcare data ecosystem is excessively fragmented to meet modern patients’ pressing needs [11]. As stakeholders are encouraged to retain their records, verifying their authenticity and accuracy becomes difficult. This situation leads to substantial server maintenance and security costs [10, 12, 13]. BCT offers a promising solution to these problems [14, 15]. It can address the exchange, integrity, confidentiality, privacy, and interoperability issues inherent in healthcare systems [10, 16]. BCT enables sharing a patient’s medical data with international parties while granting patients control over their information [8, 17]. Due to the high sensitivity of medical data, the use of BCT in healthcare facilitates the secure transfer of patient medical records and enhances healthcare data security and transparency [14, 18]. If BCT is developed appropriately, it can lead to a revolution in healthcare and reshape it to make a stable, trustworthy, protected, and sustainable digital ecosystem for better-quality health data management [19, 20]. BCT is considered one of the top technology trends for health IT, notwithstanding the widespread notion that it is still in its infancy [21]. Despite the great potential that BCT brings to the healthcare industry, the adoption rate is significantly low, with a lack of empirical evidence [19, 22, 23]. However, little research has been done to discover the factors influencing BCT adoption in healthcare organizations [24]. Current academic literature on BCT adoption found that there are research shortages in terms of the factors impacting healthcare decision-makers to adopt BCT, and these factors require additional exploration [7, 14, 15, 25]. Therefore, to deliver the maximum benefit of BCT applications in the healthcare context, more research is required to identify the factors influencing hospitals’ adoption of BCT, which motivated our study. This pilot study aims to verify the validity and reliability of the instrument developed to identify the factors influencing BCT adoption in Malaysian hospitals. The questionnaire was developed by adapting Technology-Organizational-Environment (TOE) framework and related studies constructs’ items. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents one of the earliest attempts to investigate the adoption of BCT in Malaysian hospitals at an organizational level. The healthcare sector in Malaysia is subject to rigorous regulations and stands out for its unique approach to providing services. With a vision to become a digital-first nation, Malaysia’s healthcare industry is experiencing rapid growth, with an emphasis on transferring and developing technology to foster innovations, and BCT is one of the leading technologies driving this growth [26, 27] The government of Malaysia is interested in capitalizing on the assets of the country’s current healthcare system to develop a long-term system that is equitable, effective, and efficient as well as adaptive to the quickly changing environment [27, 28]. Consequently,  
  The Factors Influencing Blockchain Adoption in Hospitals

  the healthcare industry must closely monitor changing technology adoption patterns to understand BCT’s possible effects [29]. This paper is planned as follows: The theoretical foundation and proposed model are described in Sect. 2; the methodology used is explained in Sect. 3. The results are presented and discussed in Sect. 4. Lastly, the conclusion is given in Sect. 5.  
  Based on the results obtained from the three methods described above, compelling evidence supports the discriminant validity of the research constructs proposed in the model. Consequently, the measurements have been successfully validated by analyzing construct reliability and validity.  
  5 Conclusion Blockchain technology has the possibility to improve the privacy, security, and authenticity of data, and solve the main issues in the current healthcare sector. However, its adoption is low and several factors may influence the decision. Encouraging healthcare institutions in Malaysia to implement and promote BCT requires an understanding of the factors influencing hospitals’ adoption of BCT. This study validated the instrument developed to examine the impact of technology trust, cost-effectiveness, organization readiness, top management support, competitor pressure, and government support on hospitals’ intention to adopt BCT. Measurements were modified from previous studies to fit the present investigation better. The instrument’s content validity was assessed by obtaining feedback from five academic staff and information system researchers. A pilot test was conducted to examine the reliability and validity of the instrument. The results have provided preliminary support for the model constructs and instruments utilized to evaluate the adoption of BCT in Malaysian hospitals. The reliability of the model constructs was established, with all constructs exhibiting composite reliability and Cronbach’s alpha coefficients that exceeded the recommended threshold. The convergent and discriminant validity analysis exhibited that all constructs have a satisfactory level of validity. As a result, the questionnaire is valid for use in large-scale data collection. In the context of hospitals’ adoption of BCTs, this study is one of the few to evaluate the reliability and validity of a questionnaire based on a TOE framework. This might contribute to a better understanding of BCT adoption in developing countries’ healthcare institutions, specifically Malaysia.  
  the media and popular press as a tool for measuring young people’s intentions to engage in secure behavior related to cloud services [29]. Furthermore, an empirical investigation was conducted to explore the factors influencing employee information security behavior and analyze the relationship between attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control using related theories and models [26]. 2.2 Factors Contributing to Online Game Addiction Figure 1 depicts the factors that contribute to online game addiction as suggested by Yaacob et al. [2], which include Salience, Tolerance, Mood Modification, Problems, Conflict, Withdrawal and Relapse. Such factors categorize individuals with a strong inclination towards online game addiction, who are often driven by escapism and the desire to escape their real-life circumstances. It also indicates a strong propensity to develop addictive behaviors while engaging in online gaming, which may lead to negative habits, such as stress, anxiety and other distractions.

  6 Conclusion and Future Work The study sheds light on the importance of considering protection motivation and the severity of online game addiction in fostering secure intention behavior among adolescents. The findings suggest that protection motivation can positively influence secure intention behavior, while the severity of online game addiction may have a detrimental impact on it. Therefore, interventions addressing both these factors could be essential in promoting safe and responsible online behavior. The findings also highlight the importance of education programs aimed at raising awareness about the risks associated with cybercognition and secure intention behavior. Such programs can play a crucial role in enhancing online safety practices among adolescents. Additionally, counseling and therapy programs may be necessary for individuals exhibiting high levels of online game addiction severity. These programs can address the root causes of addiction and encourage the development of healthy coping mechanisms to ensure better overall well-being. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the relationship between protection motivation, the severity of online game addiction and secure intention behavior. The findings hold potential to guide the development of interventions that promote safe and responsible online behavior while addressing the negative consequences of online game addiction. Nonetheless, there is still ample room for further research in this field. Future work can build upon these findings and further explore the complex relationships between these variables. Conducting longitudinal studies that track changes in protection motivation, the severity of online game addiction and secure intention behavior over time can provide a more nuanced understanding of these relationships. This can help to identify the specific factors that contribute to changes in these variables over time, leading to the development of targeted interventions. Cross-cultural studies should also be considered to expand the scope of this research. While this study focused on a specific population of late adolescent students in Malaysia, exploring these relationships in different cultural contexts can uncover cultural factors that might influence them. This can lead to the development of culturally appropriate interventions since such studies  
  Abstract. This research paper presents the design and development process of the M-Thyroid Care app, a mobile application prototype aimed at facilitating virtual video call-based consultations for thyroid clinics using design-based research. The app offers a convenient and accessible platform for remote consultations, enabling patients and healthcare providers, especially doctors, to engage through video calls. Additional features like chat functionality and file-sharing capabilities are incorporated to facilitate seamless communication and information exchange between patients and healthcare providers. The motivation behind developing M-Thyroid Care stems from the need to address the challenges associated with unurgent illness physical visits, specifically focusing on follow-up appointments for thyroid disorder patients. It is important to note that the app is not intended to replace physical visits but to assist clinics and healthcare providers in managing their time more effectively, allowing for more in-clinic consultations, particularly for new thyroid disorder patients. By eliminating the need for physical visits, M-Thyroid Care offers several benefits. Patients can save on travel, parking, childcare, and other related expenses, resulting in enhanced convenience and cost-effectiveness. Moreover, reducing physical visits can reduce traffic congestion and emissions, aligning with sustainable environmental practices. In summary, M-Thyroid Care represents a significant step towards leveraging mobile technology to improve thyroid healthcare consultations. The insights gained from the design and development process of M-Thyroid Care contribute to the broader understanding of designing mobile healthcare apps for remote consultations, serving as a valuable resource for future app development in telemedicine and mobile healthcare. Keywords: M-Thyroid Care · Mobile Healthcare App · Virtual Consultations  
  telemedicine apps specific to Malaysia have been developed to facilitate virtual consultations, including DoctorOnCall, BookDoc, MyDoc, HealthMetrics, Teleme, MySejahtera, Naluri, and PingDoc. These apps offer a range of features such as video consultations, chat functionality, e-prescriptions, and access to medical records, providing convenient healthcare services for patients. However, among these apps, MyDoc, developed by MyDoc Pte Ltd, a Singapore-based digital healthcare company, stands out due to its comprehensive platform that can be accessed through iOS, Android, and webbased platforms. In addition to virtual consultations and medical record access, MyDoc includes appointment booking services, health monitoring, medication reminders, and health tips, offering a holistic approach to healthcare management. While other appointment apps in Malaysia provide convenient ways to find and book appointments with healthcare providers, the specific scenario of thyroid clinics presents unique challenges. In thyroid clinics, doctors determine the appointment dates and times, and any available doctors may see patients. Therefore, there is a need to design and develop a dedicated app like M-Thyroid Care with a specialized appointment booking feature to streamline the process and ensure efficient scheduling and management of appointments, addressing the specific needs of thyroid clinics. By incorporating tailored features and functionalities, M-Thyroid Care can enhance the overall patient experience and optimize healthcare delivery in thyroid care.

  4 Results This paper focuses primarily on the second phase of the design-based research process, which involves the creation of a solution for the M-Thyroid Care application. During this crucial phase, a mobile application called “M-Thyroid Care” was designed and developed specifically for Android mobile devices. This application’s main goal is to improve the entire experience for both doctors and patients by efficiently addressing the practical issues that thyroid clinics face. 4.1 M-Thyroid Care Application Design M-Thyroid Care has been meticulously designed using a user flow process to establish a clear and structured sequence of steps and interactions for both doctors and patients when utilizing the mobile application. This user flow process serves to illustrate the different paths and decision points that users encounter while pursuing specific goals within the app. Each step in the user flow corresponds to a distinct screen or action that users can engage with during their interaction with the application. The user flow process of M-Thyroid Care encompasses three key stages: login and registration, new appointments, and appointment management. Login and Registration. For the login and registration, the user flow process is illustrated in Fig. 1. The login process is started by the user by launching the M-Thyroid Care app. The user must input their registered information, including their email address and password, in the appropriate boxes on the login screen in order to log in. The user then taps the “Log-in” button after entering the required information. The app then compares the entered credentials with the user data stored in the system to validate them and gives the user access to their main screen if the credentials are legitimate and match the records. This main screen is especially suited to the user’s function within the app, whether they are a patient or a doctor. Users who do not already have an account can register by choosing the appropriate registration option. The user is prompted during the registration process to enter the necessary information, including their name, email address, and preferred password. Once the user submits the registration form, the app starts a phase for email validation. A user can start the password reset procedure in the M-Thyroid Care app by clicking the “Reset Password” link. The software asks the user to input their registered email address when they click the “Reset Password” option. The app validates the email address after receiving it before starting the password reset process. The user’s registered email address is then sent an email with a link to reset their password. The user can access the password reset page on the designated web page by clicking the provided reset link in the email after getting it. The user can then type in and confirm a new password. The app validates the password reset and enables users to log in using their updated credentials once the new password has been successfully set. New Appointment. For the new appointment, the user flow process is illustrated in Fig. 2. In the M-Thyroid Care app, doctors can set up new appointments with their patients by navigating to the current appointment screen. They can perform a patient search, select a time and date, and enter any relevant information. The patient receives an email

  notification with the appointment information after it has been scheduled. On the app’s current screen, the patient can also see the appointment details. This procedure guarantees effective communication and makes it simple for doctors to arrange virtual consultations with their patients while keeping patients updated on their upcoming appointments.  
  Fig. 2. User Flow Process for User Appointment and Appointment Details  
  In addition to the email and password fields, the interface includes a “Forgot Password” tool to aid users with password recovery. This option is usually given as a distinct button or a clickable hyperlink. Upon selection, users are redirected to a password recovery page where they can initiate the process of resetting their password. This process commonly involves sending an email notification to the registered email address containing instructions for resetting the password and regaining access to the account.  
  Fig. 3. M-Thyroid Care Login Interface  
  Fig. 5. M-Thyroid Care Appointment Details Screen  
  The screen design emphasizes user-friendliness and clarity, enabling patients to access and comprehend their appointment details effortlessly. Patients can readily view the scheduled time and date, ensuring they are well-informed about their upcoming medical consultations. Additionally, any remarks or additional information the doctor provides are displayed, offering patients important instructions or details about their appointments. Distinct from patients, doctors possess additional privileges within the Appointment Details screen. They can modify the appointment status to “Ready” to signal their availability and readiness for the appointment. This status change serves as an indication for patients that their doctor is prepared to engage in a video call or consultation. The M-Thyroid Care application utilizes the WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) protocol to facilitate video calls between patients and doctors. WebRTC is a technology framework that enables real-time communication over web browsers without the need for external plugins or software installations. M-Thyroid Care’s integration of WebRTC provides users with a seamless and secure video call experience. WebRTC makes use of a number of standardized communication protocols, including the RealTime Transport Protocol (RTP), the Session Description Protocol (SDP), and the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE). These protocols collaborate to build and maintain  
  Designing and Developing M-Thyroid Care  
  a direct peer-to-peer connection between the patient’s and doctor’s devices, enabling realtime audio and video transmission. There are various stages to integrating video calls utilizing WebRTC within the M-Thyroid Care application. To begin, the application initiates the connection procedure when a doctor sets the appointment status to “Ready” on the Appointment Details screen, indicating their availability for a video call. The SDP protocol is used by the patient’s and doctor’s devices to exchange session descriptions, which include information on media capabilities, network addresses, and encryption settings. Following that, the ICE protocol is used to connect the devices, even in the presence of Network Address Translators (NATs) or firewalls. ICE employs several strategies, such as STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) and TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT), to select the best potential communication network path and solve network traversal challenges. Once the connection is established, the WebRTC framework allows for the real-time transmission of audio and video streams. The RTP protocol is used to packetize and transfer media data between the patient and the doctor, assuring timely delivery. WebRTC also enables advanced features such as adaptive bitrate control and echo cancellation, which improve the quality and performance of the video conversation. From a security standpoint, WebRTC’s built-in encryption techniques ensure the privacy and integrity of the video call from a security aspect. Secure transport protocols, such as Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS), are used to encrypt media streams, preventing eavesdropping and unwanted access to the communication. Moreover, patients and doctors can also use a menu button at the bottom of the screen. This menu button provides a variety of functions to improve the user experience. Users can attach photos, files, and videos to appointments, allowing for the effective sharing of medical reports, test results, and other associated materials. This feature encourages patients and doctors to communicate and collaborate effectively, allowing for a thorough grasp of the patient’s situation. In addition, the Appointment Details screen has a chat button, which allows patients and doctors to communicate in real time. This chat functionality promotes effective and convenient communication by allowing users to clear up any doubts, ask questions, or provide extra information about the visit or the patient’s condition. Following the conclusion of a video call session between a patient and a doctor within the M-Thyroid Care application, the doctor is prompted to set the appointment status to “Completed”, indicating the end of the appointment. This action is an important step in the workflow to ensure proper record-keeping and maintenance of the patient’s medical history. Following the completion of the appointment, the session details are made available in the Appointment History screen, allowing for comprehensive and organized documentation. By setting the appointment as “Completed”, the doctor confirms that the session has ended satisfactorily and that all necessary medical interactions have happened. This is an important step in the appointment lifecycle since it marks the change from an ongoing consultation to a closed session. It allows both the doctor and the patient to clearly realize that the appointment’s objectives have been reached. The Appointment History screen is a repository for past appointment details, ensuring a complete record of the patient’s medical history. This screen gives users, including doctors and patients, access to a list of completed appointments in chronological order. Each appointment entry in the history comprises pertinent information such as the date  
  epochs. Our robust model validation methodology incorporates multiple performance metrics.  
  2 Problem Statement The Covid-19 pandemic has significantly impacted global public health, necessitating effective diagnosis [11]. However, despite some relief from the contagious virus, healthcare institutions worldwide still face a significant number of positive cases. In addition, interpreting chest X-rays for Covid-19 detection presents challenges, with previous studies relying on limited data and radiologists’ expertise [8, 12, 13, 17]. Therefore, there is a critical need for more accurate, efficient, and automated methods utilizing diverse and sufficient data. This paper addresses this issue by employing two distinct chest Xray datasets for Covid-19 detection, classifying the data into COVID (+) and COVID (−), and creating separate train and test sets. The model is trained using TensorFlow, Keras, and a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) to enhance diagnostic capabilities.  
  4.1 Dataset and Justification This academic study employs two distinct chest X-ray (CXR) image datasets for training and evaluating a deep-learning model for Covid-19 detection Fig. 2. Using two datasets is crucial to ensure diverse representation, enhance model generalization, and validate its performance.

  Abstract. BacaDisleksia is an application specifically designed for children with dyslexia learning to read. The application aims to facilitate dyslexic children and ease their reading by carefully considering the Human-Computer Interaction and Interaction Design fundamentals that could facilitate them to read better. However, the design of BacaDisleksia is yet to be empirically confirmed. Therefore, a usability testing was conducted using Tobii eye-tracker to further examine its design. Six dyslexic children as participants were involved in the testing revealing design issues related to BacaDisleksia that can be improved based on eye-tracking data such as heat maps and gaze plots. As a results, this paper presents the eye-tracking usability findings that could inform dyslexia-friendlier design decisions for any application with a similar aim as BacaDisleksia. Such design decisions are crucial in digital innovation to provide better digital solutions for dyslexia and other learners with reading difficulties, in line with one of UNESCO’s aims for having the technology to support inclusivity for children with disabilities, including learning disabilities such as dyslexia.

  H. Husni et al.  
  BacaDisleksia is an application designed and developed with the aim to ease the reading process by offering the children an interactive, self-assessed intervention for a stress-free reading session. Its fundamentals are based on three Interaction Design (IxD) dimensions [2] – text (1D), visual representation (2D), and behavior (5D) – leaving the other two dimensions untouched, i.e., space (3D) and time (4D). The three dimensions are selected based on the needs of children with dyslexia when it comes to an application for reading, as most of the interaction covers text, visual representation, and the application’s behavior. The other two dimensions are not considered, as each child requires a different time and reads at an individual pace (4D). The interaction with BacaDisleksia is mainly using a mouse and very minimal use of keyboards. Since 3D is concerned with tangible means of control, it is not included, as any changes or improved aspects concern this dimension. Besides IxD, the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) interaction model also serves as its base for the design, following the classic [3] interaction model. This application aims to provide an interactive reading tool that can facilitate children’s reading better by introducing features that could ease learning to read, such as Irlen color theory [4] for the reading background. In this paper, we explore the potential of using an eye tracker in a usability study with dyslexic children to uncover design decisions we could have missed when designing and developing the application. Such intricate eye-tracking data could potentially be considered to improve further the design aspects, not only on the user interface but also the interaction that comes with it. What are the usability issues that can be uncovered from BacaDisleksia? How does the eye-tracking help in conducting usability testing with children with dyslexia? What design suggestions can be made to improve the interaction and user experience for the children?  
  2 Eye-Tracking for Dyslexia 2.1 Dyslexia Dyslexia is a neurological learning disability that particularly hinders a child’s reading abilities [5, 6]. Despite having normal intelligence, these children frequently read at substantially lower levels than expected. People with dyslexia often struggle with spelling, reading comprehension, and the ability to learn a second language. Nonetheless, these issues are independent of their overall IQ level, as dyslexia is an unforeseen reading challenge for a child who is intelligent enough to be a far better reader. However, children with dyslexia who happen to be slow readers often, paradoxically, are very fast and creative thinkers with strong reasoning [6]. Dyslexia can be inherited in some families, and recent studies have identified a number of genes that may predispose an individual to develop dyslexia. The main focus of remediation for dyslexia should be on the specific learning problems of affected individuals. The usual course is to modify teaching methods, tools, and the educational environment to meet the specific needs of the individual with dyslexia. That said, a good interactive tool should be designed and developed to suit dyslexics to assist their learning. A study by Lebeniˇcnik [7] spells out that the key problems experienced by dyslexic users are confusing page layout, unclear navigation, poor color

  before the start of the test. At the beginning of the test, the eye gaze of each participant is calibrated. The calibration process may take quite some time to complete. Participants were advised to follow the following regulation to ensure successful calibration and avoid further issues during eye tracking. The regulations are no glasses, no hat, no physical objects that could potentially get between the eye and the eye-tracker, sitting relatively straight in the chair, does not fidget or move too much, and remains at about 20 to 23 inches from the monitor at all times, and remain positioned in the middle of the monitor at all times. 3.3 The Tasks Five tasks have been identified based on the main functions and purpose of BacaDisleksia as listed in Table 1. With the five tasks, the participants were asked to express their thoughts during the test, following the Thinking Out Loud method. The premise is that users keep up a running commentary to say what they think as they attempt their tasks. This can help to better understand usability issues and suggest solutions to the problems faced. However, the tester has to facilitate the process by asking probing questions, considering that the participants are children with limited expression of thoughts and actions. Table 1. The tasks specified for the usability test using an eye tracker. No.

  In this study, the usage of an eye tracker in the usability of BacaDisleksia gives a better understanding and comprehension of the usability problems of BacaDisleksia towards dyslexic children. BacaDisleksia is designed and developed to assist dyslexic children to learn to read with their own preferences on the color of the font, the background, and the levels of difficulties, presumably reducing their cognitive load while attempting to read. To determine its usability issues, the evaluation was made to understand problems encountered during the children’s learning session thus improving the design. In addition to the traditional usability study such as the study of effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction, the usage of eye-tracker provides data visualization in the form of heatmaps and gaze plots. These two visualization data indicate the amount of time and the focus of the eye gaze spent and its movement. The significant intensity of the heatmap accumulated can be observed from participant P5 upon completing Task 5. The participant spent a lot of time at the word, causing the color intensity to darken thus showing the area of eye focus. The significant gaze plot that shows a lot of eye movement can be found in participant P2 task 5. The eye movement of the participant shows that she encountered problems when trying to find the color palette to change the reading background colour. The color palette’s position is located at the bottom side of the interface and besides the word level difficulties (denoted by three facial expressions). Participant P2 eye movement went all over the user interface rather than going straight to the designated palette to complete the task given. The user interface design may need to be reconsidered; for example, moving the color palette to the side of the user interface as the focus of the children may be  
  Eye-Tracking Usability Data of BacaDisleksia  
  distracted by the facial expressions (level of difficulties icons) at the bottom. Besides, the left side of the interface is not as crowded as the bottom side. Although the children successfully completed all tasks, they were having difficulty operating the software because most dyslexic children are not good at using computers or have less experience using a computer. Most of them are novice users and rarely use computers. This can be shown when some of the children had difficulty typing their names, perhaps due to them having dyslexia and thus making it harder for them to find the alphabet. The arrangement of the alphabet on the keyboard is one of the reasons for the delay in completing the task. The children are used to the sequence of ‘ABCs’ that they need to find the alphabet one at a time. They often encounter typing errors and confusion to differentiate the alphabet, such as ‘D’ and ‘O’. One of the children took almost one minute just to log in to the application even though her name only contains five alphabets. She obviously had difficulty differentiating the alphabet. She confused ‘D’ with ‘O’, ‘A’ with ‘R’, and ‘M with ‘N’. However, most children only encountered difficulty operating the computer while logging in. After logging in, they did not have much difficulty. They can operate the software fairly well. This was proven for participant P5. Even though she had difficulty during login which is the first task, she managed to perform well for the subsequent tasks. She understood the task well and knew how to operate BacaDisleksia application with minimal error. This can also be observed in “Find the word ‘bapa’ and spell it outloud” task (Task 4). All the children managed to complete the task on average at the same time. The dyslexic children find the word ‘bapa’, which only has four alphabets in a two-syllable word. Compared to Task 5, which is to find the words ‘sayang’, although it is a two-syllable word, the second syllable ‘yang’ imposed some difficulty to some of the children comes with the diphthong (‘ng’), making it more challenging to spell and read correctly. Thus, more time is needed to find, identify, and read the word. Therefore, the design of how the word should be presented could be considered to assist dyslexic children in reading longer, more difficult words.  
  5 Design Decisions and Recommendation The eye tracking data, provides valuable and insightful design suggestions for the improvement of BacaDisleksia. Of course, the fundamentals remain, but the user interface could be improved further for better interaction, providing enhanced reading experience. Firstly, the namespace in the login interface. As the blank space to fill in their name use a feature that can fill in unlimited alphabet, by limiting the alphabet, children can only enter their nickname in the space which can prevent them from entering their full name thus reducing the error and can improve their emotional distress. There is obviously the pros and cons to it – on the positive note, it is easier for them to spell out short names rather the long ones; on the other hand, it could also be a platform for them to learn to spell their full name. Anyway, it is a matter of choice and what objective we are aiming for. Technically, both can be easily accomplished. Secondly, the representation of the word. Having different levels of difficulty with the word is a great idea, but how the word is represented is also an important element  
  H. Husni et al.  
  to assist dyslexic children. In addition to different syllables having different colors, adding a hyphen in between two or more syllables can also help children who are suffering from severe dyslexia, as suggested by [17, 18]. This would assist in terms of its visual representation, which further enhanced the separation of the syllables in a word and between alphabets. Dyslexic children find crowded words jumpy, making reading difficult and stressful [19]. Eliminating or reducing stress and cognitive load is important for their successful design. Thirdly, the placement of the color palette for choosing the background color. This feature is considered one of the important factors leading to correct spelling and reading. Based on the eye-tracking data, the current position at the bottom of the user interface has caused some distractions to the children. This is probably due to the somewhat crowded space at the bottom of the user interface with many icons and features. Instead of putting it at the bottom of the page, the background color could be place near the font color (or syllable color) selection located at the right side of the user interface. Re-positioning this color palette would satisfy one of the Gestalt Principles as it groups similar, related features, thus reducing cognitive load in terms of interaction. Such design suggestions could be mapped and summarized into suitable Interaction Design (IxD) dimensions for design recommendation. The IxD dimensions considered include text (1D), visual representation (2D), and behavior (5D). There are also potential considerations of careful design of time (3D) and space (4D) to enhance the learning experience for the children using BacaDisleksia. However, based on the findings and new insights obtained from the eye-tracking usability conducted, much of the design decisions and recommendations fall under 2D and 5D, leaving 1D not so much affected. This suggests improving the representation of the words and the layout of the user interface following Gestalt Principle and mapping it back to what children with dyslexia really need to read better and more accurately using an application. The login user interface suggests considering the third IxD dimension, i.e., time (3D), towards improving the interaction. The time recorded to accomplish each task, as depicted in Table 2, could also point out areas of the interaction that can be further improved. By providing the mapping of IxD dimensions and existing principles in HCI, having the characteristics of children with dyslexia and their specific needs serving as the foundation of such inclusive design, a reading application such as BacaDisleksia could be leveraged as an assistive technology for facilitating reading to these struggling readers. This could lead to positive development in inclusive design for children with learning disabilities, as careful consideration is crucial, and adaptation to such specific needs requires careful design, understanding, and empathy.  
  6 Conclusion Eye-tracking usability could uncover unnoticed issues that potentially lead to insightful design improvement. The eye movement, eye gaze, and the children’s focus can be evaluated with the tasks prepared for them. The study results are presented in the form of heat maps and gaze plots. From the testing, all of the children completed all the tasks given even though a few children took longer to complete the task. The heat map and gaze plot of these participants were analyzed and compared to children with little

  Abstract. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a frequent neurodevelopmental disorder affecting children and adults, which is routinely diagnosed based on subjective observations and behavioural assessments. Recent advancements in neuroimaging, particularly in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), have provided a better understanding of the functional brain network impairments linked to ADHD. The human brain naturally consists of resting-state networks (RSNs) that are spatially distinct and functionally homogenous. Therefore, identifying ADHD biomarkers using the human brain’s RSNs is a promising approach. In order to make accurate statistical inferences in brain science, it is necessary to utilize brain atlases for localizing network-ofinterest (NoIs). However, locating the spatial components of these RSNs using human brain functional atlases poses challenges due to a lack of disease-specific atlases and atlases concordance issues. This research (1) conducts a study and addresses six RSNs that are frequently referenced in ADHD literature: (Auditory-, Cognitive Control-, Dorsal Attention-, Default Mode-, Sensorimotor-, and Ventral Attention-) Networks (2) Introduces a framework that attempts to enhance the generation of ADHD-specific brain reference, named “Hexa-Net”; This comprehensive approach may improve the reliability and applicability of ADHD studies to a fresh level via segregating and integrating the brain into (NoIs) by evaluating predetermined brain atlases. We hypothesize that the Hexa-Net Model can offer a more precise and unbiased method for identifying ADHD-related impairments. As a result, this framework serves as a practical guide for analyzing biomarkers from rs-fMRI scans to aid in diagnosing ADHD.

This image clarify that the parcellations defined by different atlases lack consistency and is adopted from [18] to visualize the “Brain Atlases Concordance Problem”: The Superior Temporal gyrus defined at different ways by four different atlases (from left to right AAL1, CerebrA, Hammersmith and Harvard Oxford (HO)).  
  Insufficient attention has been given to standardizing brain atlases [21]. As far as researchers know, no ADHD-specific brain functional atlas or reference is obtained from rs-fMRI data; thus, neuroimaging studies targeted at comprehending the functional connectivity and cognitive performance of the ADHD brain may be restricted without a frame of reference. One challenge arises when different catalogues/atlases assign the same label to RSNs despite their distinct spatial composition. To overcome these challenges with the target of creating an ADHD-specific brain reference, this work suggested an approach in the context of unifying and integrating multiple brain networks from predefined brain atlases into one model, this work proposes a systematic framework for conducting a methodical evaluation of several functional brain parcellations regardless of their generating approaches and the number of

  delineated networks to identify and label multi-source RSNs into single brain reference accurately. An introduction to ADHD, its diagnostic criteria, and the contribution of neuroimaging of the disorder diagnosis was provided above; then, the rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2. Dives into the state of arts on methods identified ADHD-based (RSNs) and the commonly used pre-computed brain atlases. Then Sect. 2 offers a schematic framework for selecting a parcellation tailored to ADHD brain investigations. Additionally, in Sect. 3, the researcher discusses how to use the suggested framework could standardize brain RSNs identification in ADHD research. Furthermore, Sect. 4 concludes the work.  
  2 Related Works 2.1 The Role of RSNs in Identifying ADHD Functional and structural connectivity alterations have been documented in various neuropsychiatric conditions [22]. Evidence revealed that individuals with ADHD experience dysregulation of neural networks (i.e., across multiple brain regions) as DAN, DMN, and AUN, not just specific ones, as proofed by extensive research in this field [23, 24]. This section explores the question of how many networks are thought to have dysfunctional behaviour in ADHD. The exact delineation of brain regions and networks is an essential concept in neuroscience; function, connectivity, architecture, and topography are crucial in defining these regions [22, 25]. Variability in network nomenclature across studies limits the integration of findings. Recent research indicates that ADHD may arise from alterations in brain connectivity patterns, particularly in functional connectivity networks (RSNs) among different brain regions that coordinate cognition and activity [24]. Acknowledging that various atlases may utilize different terminology when describing identical anatomical regions and (RSNs) is essential. In depth, the Cognitive Control Network (CCN) simultaneously known as Fronto-Parietal Control Network (FPCN) or Executive Control Network (ECN) as stated in [26, 27], while Yeo, Krienen [28] used the term Ventral Attention Network (VAN) which is referred to Salience Network (SN) in [29] and Cingulo-Opercular Network in [17]. Furthermore, “Affective or Motivational Network” is sometimes referred to as “Limbic Network”; Sect. 4 provides more information about this challenge. Another issue is that RSNs are frequently categorized by authors who often exhibit biases that arise from their subjective understanding of the network’s spatial or functional configurations. Finally, some atlases offer individual maps for subdivisions within the same RSN, and they require integration to represent the complete RSN; For instance, some scholars have employed the Sensorimotor Network (SMN) to signify the incorporated Sensorimotor and Auditory Networks (AUN). Conversely, others have deemed it appropriate to split it into two discrete (RSNs): the primary SMN and the Auditory Network (AUN) [17]. Three theories have been introduced here, from the perspective of RSNs, to advance the study of ADHD Brain Connectivity. These theories are based on previous studies and aim to build upon existing knowledge:

  that could interpret the visual world, and retinal fundus image is one of the implemented AI imaging subjects [2]. Retinal fundus image captured to define staging of diabetic retinopathy (DR), which is one of the chronic diseases. DR is a complication related to long-term diabetic diseases. It is pathologically affected by prolonged high blood sugar level that causes damage to the blood vessels in the retina. Damaged blood vessels can be seen as enlargement and leakage of the blood vessel. There are two types of DR: nonproliferative (NPDR) and proliferative (PDR). NPDR is a type of DR that is less severe and does not cause symptoms. PDR is a well-known type of DR that creates new fragile blood vessels in the retina [3]. There are a lot of people that have lost their eyesight because of DR. Earlier diagnosis and treatment, DR can be prevented from progressing to blindness. In order to diagnose DR, an ophthalmologist will look for abnormal signs such as haemorrhages, microaneurysms, and hard exudates that appeared on the retinal fundus image [4]. The examination of retinal fundus images is frequently employed in the current day to assist ophthalmologists in gathering essential information about a patient’s retina to detect DR [5]. In Malaysia nowadays, we are facing a shortage of ophthalmologists [6]. With the increasing trend of DR, it burdens ophthalmologists with more workload and fewer staff. Consequently, it contributes to long appointment waiting times and worsened DR staging prognoses. Furthermore, the procedure for treating the DR is usually made through an appointment with an ophthalmologist. Most patients only meet the ophthalmologist when the eye vision has blurring and or even blindness has set in. Problems also appeared as most of the retinal fundus images captured always faced low image quality, such as low contrast, low illumination, and colour inconsistency. Hence, due to aging populations, a shortage of ophthalmologists, and medical sustainability challenges, an efficient and accurate system is needed to make the procedure and the results accurate [7]. Therefore, this system’s existence can help the ophthalmologist make an early diagnosis and prognosis for the patient as the image can be automatically enhanced. This motivational approach may directly increase efficiency and creativity for eye care facilities infrastructure, specifically in rural areas. The research aims to design and construct an AI-based system for eyecare facilities that can improve retinal fundus images for detecting DR patients in rural areas. One of the most significant aspects of screening DR is detecting abnormal fundus images. Some problems, like low contrast and blur image, may seriously affect the diagnostic stages. The authors used three methods for improving the fundus image: Retinex, Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and Low-Light Enhancement. These methods perform better in handling low-contrast images and blurred images [8]. So, based on this system, ophthalmologists can precisely identify a patient with a DR problem. Hopefully, it will improve systematic DR screening program, human resources, and infrastructure distribution that align with the population’s needs especially in rural areas. This study consists of six topics: introduction, related work, methodology, result and evaluation, and conclusion.

  DR classification. The system’s function has been designed and implemented, as well as the system’s interface. The image processing approach is built using MATLAB software. The system has been tested to ensure that there is no bug. HUSM ophthalmologists test the system by employing the system in the last step. 3.1 Image Processing A flow chart of image processing is shown in Fig. 2. First, the fundus camera captured retinal fundus image and converts RGB to Hue Saturation Value (HSV). Retinex, CLAHE, and Low-light enhancement are three types of enhancement methods applied on the converted HSV image. Finally, the visual quality of the enhanced retinal fundus image is measured using the Mean Squared Error (MSE), Peak-Signal Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM).

  5 Conclusion and Future Work In this paper, image enhancement methods including Retinex, CLAHE and Low-light were applied to automate enhancing low quality retinal fundus image to support the diagnosis of DR. The results of the experiments demonstrated that DRES (AI-based system) can improve retinal fundus images significantly, using Retinex enhancement method. The results tested in the DRES system showed that Retinex enhancement was the best method. Retinex had the highest performance value compared to CLAHE and Lowlight enhancement. The features using Retinex enhancement such as hard exudates and haemorrhage was clear enhanced rather than original retina image. This study explored different image enhancement techniques for the same dataset to determine the variation of the output image. Although DRES helps overcome issues of related to the lack of ophthalmologists visiting rural areas for elderly and multi-morbid DR patients, the biggest challenge for

  Abstract. The challenge to dengue prevention lies in sustaining the preventive activity among the community, which commonly occurs periodically, i.e., when there are dengue outbreaks, with health officers under the Communication for Behavioural Impact (COMBI) campaign. In this paper, a mobile application is specifically developed based on the COMBI Behavioural Change model, which focuses on persuading users to adopt and sustain new habits. The application was carefully designed to reflect the stages of behavioural change. Combining both quantitative and qualitative approaches, an experiment was performed over a four-week study with eight participants, and based on the empirical findings, it is found that with careful design, users can be persuaded to take up the new habit. Two traits that are deemed important are understanding the ‘why’, and the trait of being responsible citizens. In addition, at the end of the study, users felt comfortable continuing with the cleaning activities without the application. Thus, more thoughts should be considered for the application to remain relevant in the sustainable phase. Keywords: Dengue Prevention · Persuasive Technology · Behavioural Change  
  Many case studies in tropical and subtropical countries around the world succeed in preventing and controlling dengue through community participation [13–17]. The key to success is the sustainability shown by the community in the activity, and for sustainability to happen, behavioural change must occur, or it would become a periodic event. But behaviour change is not easy to achieve. In Malaysia, many awareness activities have been carried out by the Pejabat Kesihatan Daerah (District Health Office) of every state through COMBI [18, 19]. However, the impact is still very small and unsustainable [20, 21]. Sustainable community participation is paramount to the surveillance system that is a part of the national health information system. By doing so, a harmonized effort across national dengue surveillance systems can inform the critical data of the disease’s burden, which is necessary to assess progress in reaching mortality and morbidity reduction goals [19]. In this study, we designed an experiment to investigate the effect of usage of a mobile application that is designed based on the COMBI Behavioural Change model [22]. In particular, the created features of the application were intended to translate each of the phases we identified for the behavioural change to be initiated, progressed, and sustained. We deployed the application for a four-week user study with 8 participants. Our study explores, in the specific domain of behavioural change, how persuasive applications can create change in user attitudes and sustain it. Both qualitatively and quantitatively, we examine how the features of the application affect the users’ perceptions and awareness of their activities, creating the potential for behaviour change.  
  2 Experiment Design We developed a working prototype mobile application based on the found model derived from self-previous work [22] with 8 users for 4 weeks. In this section, we describe the design of the application and the methods of the experiment. 2.1 System Description 2.1.1 Data In Malaysia, the dengue prevention initiative recommended by COMBI and the Ministry of Health is to spend at least 10 min per week cleaning. Based on this guideline, we collected data on the types of activities performed by each user and the time spent to conduct the activity. We also recorded the images of places involved in the cleaning activity. In addition, to support the eco-system of COMBI at the community level, data on the COMBI team that one joins with its leader are also considered. All recorded data are presented to users, where they can see their performance, either weekly or monthly, i.e., the accumulated time spent on cleaning and the activities performed. If the user is the COMBI leader, he/she can also monitor the accumulated time of his/her members. The ability to review past activities is an important feature as part of a persuasive design strategy [23].

  Contemplation. In this phase, no prevention activity is engaged, but there is already an intention to do so. This phase’s intervention strategies are education, advice, and comparison. The trigger element is the spark. As soon as the Get Started button is clicked, it brings a user to the login screen, where there are options to either sign up with their Google account or proceed with the registration process (Fig. 2 first and second images). Figure 2, the third image, where the user is ready to start, can first explore what he/she does as part of the prevention activity. One can learn more from News, FAQ, and Community pages to set goals and compare how others are doing.

  Preparation. User in this phase has started to be involved in the prevention activity, where the intervention strategies are setting goals and comparison. Facilitator is the trigger for this phase. In the set of images in Fig. 3, they show the flow of screens when recording their cleaning activity, by first taking a picture, starting the cleaning time, stopping the cleaning time, and choosing the type of cleaning activity they have performed. Every step of the sequence facilitates the user to accomplish the activity. Competence. In this phase, the user has been consistently involved in prevention activity for a certain amount of time, where the intervention strategies are engagement, communication, and reward. Signal is used as the trigger. Figure 4 shows the community screens where one could connect and engage with other users. Maintenance. The final phase refers to when the user has been consistently involved in prevention activity for a longer period that has broken the old habit. Communication and reward are the intervention strategies applied, and the signal is the trigger. Consistent users can view their past activities (Fig. 5).

  4-week Field Experiment. At the beginning of the 4-week study, we created a Telegram group as a platform to touch base with participants. We held an introductory session with the participants via Google Meet to share the aim of the study and provided them with brief information about the application. We informed the participants that we wanted to understand how they would use the application to help fight dengue through cleaning activities. A short survey was distributed at the end of the second week as an interim to gauge the participants’ motivation level. The chronological recorded time and activities for the four weeks may provide evidence of the possible behaviour change on the individual level in a semi-longitudinal manner. We hypothesized the frequent logged time and activity would reflect the participant’s attempt to change his or her habit of dengue prevention. Post-completion Survey. At the end of the 4-week use period, we posted the URL link to the final survey via Telegram. Through the survey, our goal is to evaluate these concerns; (i) user experience with the application and (ii) the transition one had throughout the 5 phases, although we did not explicitly mention the phase to them. In addition, we asked about their current awareness of dengue prevention and whether they will resume this habit.  
  3 Results We obtained the results of the participants at the end of the experiment. Our analysis showed each individual’s persuasion toward behaviour change is varied and gradual. We also present the results of the detailed findings of every phase. 3.1 General Performances Before the study, none of the participants knew much about COMBI cleaning initiatives as part of dengue prevention by the Ministry of Health (MoH) Malaysia. The participants were briefed about the common activities recommended during the introductory session, but they were free to add other cleaning-related activities. Over four weeks, turning over water containers is the most frequent activity. While the least frequent are the bottom four as in Fig. 6, where the participants add these activities to the cleaning activities. Over the course of four weeks, the pattern of the weekly participation is only consistent for three participants: P2, P3, and P6. In addition, what is noticeable from the data (see Fig. 7), all weekly participants did not spend close to 10 min per week as recommended by MoH. Nonetheless, as newcomers who just started, and even more so for the three consistent participants, this can be considered an accomplishment. 3.2 Behavioural Change Phases We are also interested in understanding the experiences the participants went through as they used the application. Without disclosing the phases to the participants, we inquired about their experiences in the final survey as they were at specific stages and the respective application screens.  
  Persuading People to Fight Dengue and Sustaining It  
  Maintenance. Going into the final week, most participants have shown positive changes in their behaviour. There were incidents where they forgot to use the application but continued with the prevention activity. This is a sign of the activity adopted to be sustainable. “…without the app also I will have habits already now as I was doing for 4 weeks. (P3)” “(I) Always want (to) carry out with the apps, but since I just do it straight away, I forget (about) it and just realize after finishing the cleaning. (P8)” To keep it more engaging, another participant wishes the community to be taking a more active role in sharing what they do on the platform. “It was cool to me, and I was eager to see what people posted in the community, I think it would be more fun if we could see people posting their activities to know what they do every week. (P2)” In sustaining the new habit, the participants had mixed reactions to doing the cleaning activities with the application or without. Some who are already comfortable with the cleaning activities do not feel the urge to keep using the application unless more features are added to enhance the experience and make it more impactful. “Yes because my living area had many dengue cases, without the app, it was attractive to me at first since I wanted to learn more about the info to avoid dengue. If there are more updates, news, games, and people involved in the app, I might consider to continue using the app.” (P2) “Yes, I would continue even without the applications as cleanliness is essential to build a safe and healthy environment. However, with the application that is able to record and share the cleaning activities, it is able to spread awareness of dengue diseases in our community, besides motivating them to perform cleaning more. (P4)”  
  4 Discussion The results of our study answered our research question on the role played by an application if properly designed can persuade people and sustain a new habit. We also have discovered other pertinent findings from the study. Here we articulate three remarks derived from the analysis of the result. 4.1 Adopting New Habit Through Persuasion We learned that providing the Why is very essential in the persuasion of behaviour change. This is supported in psychology [24] to get everyone on the same page. Cleaning activities are trivial, but understanding how it impacts dengue prevention gives users a new perspective. We also noticed that self-responsibility is another trait that we found contributed to behaviour change. Seeing how others do and how others can see one’s contribution also play roles in persuading oneself to continue doing the activity.

  Heuristic Evaluation, and Remote Usability Testing. Usability testing aims to evaluate digital products’ effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction. All the above methods do not involve eye-tracking to analyse eye fixation to explain human behaviour while using a website. Eye-tracking in a web-usability test is a technique where the eye movement is recorded while the participant performs the tasks given during the test. The eye will not be fixed in one position for too long but normally moves several times per second. The eye-tracking software usually captures the fixation and saccades. The data from the eye tracker are analysed through several methods: gaze replay, gaze plots, and heat maps [3]. The eye-tracking patterns analysed from the data collected will be correlated to the usability problems. Data from eye-tracking can be used to assist in a better understanding of user reactions. The motivation to study the usability of the UUM Student portal is that the students will use it frequently throughout their study period. Problems related to the interface or system identified during the test will help improve the website’s usability. Suggestions can be made to improve and elevate the user experience. This study aims to identify the usability problems of the UUM Student Web Portal through usability testing using eye-tracking data. The second objective is to provide suggestions for improvement to enhance the user experience while using UUM Student Web Portal. This paper discusses the related work in which eye-tracking is used to gain insight into a webpage’s usability. Then, the method, results, and suggestions to improve the usability of the UUM Student Portal are also discussed in this paper.  
  taken to complete a task. The participants spend too much time using the site’s search option to find and register for courses. Thus, the search options must be re-designed to increase Coursera’s efficiency. The participants’ opinions examined the satisfaction of Coursera. Most participants state it was difficult to use, while a group of participants are satisfied with Coursera’s usability. Some factors that reduce user satisfaction are no language support provided and only a part of the website is translated into Turkish. Language support and translation are also essential to improve the usability of the website. In the second part of the study, the eye-tracking study was carried out to support the Coursera usability study. The test took place at the eye-tracking laboratory with three participants who were not involved in the study’s first phase. The participants are also given nine tasks, similar to the first phase tasks. The data from the eye tracker is visualized as heat maps and gaze plots. The data from heat maps and gaze plots shows that the participant did not focus on the search bar, which is the most important function of the task. The statement is made based on the evidence from the heat zones on the heat maps which shows the participants focus more on the menu and content part. These findings suggest that the search bar may need to be re-designed and to be placed in a more visible area. Zardari et al. [6] also use eye tracking and other usability tests to evaluate e-learning portals. Three usability experts were involved in this study for heuristic evaluation using the 10 usability heuristics by Nielsen. From the heuristic evaluation, problems that are related to navigation are detected. For example, when the user browses to any other page, the current page in the navigation bar becomes highlighted to show the current position of the user. But in the portal, the highlighted navigation bar was different from the page that was visible. Nielsen [7] advises that one should create a system that is similar to the real world. For the eye-tracking component of this study, twenty students are involved. The data collected from the eye-tracking session are dynamic gaze maps, gaze fixations and heat maps. The data collected from the eye tracker provides additional information regarding the portal’s user interface (UI) elements. Heat maps showing the higher heat around the menu suggest that the user faced some difficulty to find the desired feature or button. This situation can be associated with the complexity of the interface. It can be concluded as the eye-tracking evaluation can help to locate usability problems regarding its UI. For example, the higher fixations showed signs of confusion and may lead to the discovery of the usability problems of the webpage. Additionally, Goldbergs and Kotval [8] investigate the correlations between eye-tracking metrics and usability problems. Table 1 shows the summary of the eye movement metrics and their related cognitive process or usability problems. Integrating eye trackers in a usability test could enhance the findings. The data visualization from the eye tracking can provide extra information that will lead to the discovery of trends or patterns in eye movement that can suggest the possible usability problems of a website.

  education, finance, and retail [1–5]. Moreover, dashboards have become an indispensable tool for organizations seeking to improve their operational efficiency and elevate their decision-making processes. There has been a growing trend in the adoption of dashboards in the field of education, with universities increasingly utilizing dashboards to facilitate data-driven decisionmaking. Dashboards offer a visual representation of key performance metrics and data, enabling university administrators to identify areas of strength and weakness in various academic and administrative functions. This facilitates effective resource allocation, strategic planning, and decision-making. Furthermore, dashboards can be customized to cater to the specific needs of different stakeholders, such as students, faculty, and administrators. With the increasing availability of data in universities, the trend towards dashboard utilization is expected to continue, with future research focusing on developing more sophisticated dashboard models that incorporate advanced analytics techniques and machine learning algorithms [6–8] to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of data-driven decision-making. The primary objective of higher education institutions such as universities is to provide quality education and produce graduates who are well-rounded. In Malaysia, universities aspire to become centers of excellence for education, leading referral centers for all aspects of education scholarship, and premier resource centers for various studies. However, the current economic situation presents significant challenges for these institutions in terms of achieving their objectives. Despite the challenges, universities in Malaysia are determined to become the world’s top university. To achieve this goal, it is essential to address issues such as the development of a comprehensive decision-making process for students. Students are critical to universities, as they are the fundamental basis of these institutions. Thus, it is vital for universities to prioritize the well-being of their students, considering their function as the primary revenue source, reputation enhancers, key players in the research and innovation framework, future alumni, and deserving beneficiaries of a safe and supportive educational environment, aligned with the social obligations of universities. The top management of universities plays a crucial role in developing appropriate policies and making informed decisions that benefit the students. To address this challenge, higher institutions like universities recognize the need for a platform that can provide the university’s top management with a well-organized and systematic presentation of the university and student data. An innovative approach such as the business intelligence approach is necessary to provide the required perspective to solve the problem at hand. The business intelligence approach encompasses the processes, technologies, and tools that organizations use to collect, analyze, and present data that enables the analysis of information to optimize decisions and performance [9, 10]. The aim of this research paper is to present a new university dashboard model that integrates all essential components of student data on campus, implemented in a higher education institution in Malaysia. This model will provide extensive and regular monitoring of various student data segments, enabling top management to gain a more comprehensive perspective on the students’ condition on campus. To ensure the usability of the dashboard model while balancing the target audience’s needs with technicality and

  information, we will evaluate it using the Datus model. The Datus model is a comprehensive framework that supports organizations in designing and implementing effective dashboards, considering multiple factors such as data sources, data quality, visualization techniques, user requirements, and performance indicators. The remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows: Sect. 2 presents related works to address the issues of existing methods in designing a university dashboard model. Section 3 outlines the proposed dashboard model and its methodology for developing the dashboards. Section 4 presents and discusses the procedure of evaluation and the evaluation results of the proposed models in detail. Finally, Sect. 5 provides concluding remarks, including a discussion of potential future research areas.  
  2 Related Work Mihaela et al. [11] presented a performance dashboard model designed to enhance the efficiency of measuring, monitoring, and managing organizational performance for executives. Their work included a SWOT analysis to implement a performance management system and dashboard for Romanian universities, currently undergoing significant changes to remain competitive in the market. The study focused on the critical components of a performance dashboard that can provide accurate and timely information to university management. Although the proposed dashboard model covered six dimensions of university focus, including research, finance, business processes, staff and workplace satisfaction, student teaching and learning, and faculty, the authors did not provide detailed explanations for refining each component. The student segment, for example, only covers a few parameters such as enrollment, retention rate, student outcomes, and students living on campus, which does not offer a comprehensive view of student life on campus. The dashboard’s requirement was considered weak due to the absence of a user acceptance test model to confirm its relevance. This study proposes a well-constructed requirement for the university’s performance dashboard, including all necessary and accurate information related to students on campus. The proposed dashboard model evaluates and refines each focus of the student through a series of processes with top management, leading to high user acceptance. Erna et al. [12] introduced a tactical dashboard model designed to present program study information at a university in Indonesia. The primary objective of this research was to develop a dashboard model that emphasized accurate presentation of pertinent information based on the university’s requirements. While the proposed dashboard model describes a well-refined process for identifying the appropriate parameters, the refinement process was based on assumptions and not on any specific dashboard development model or collection requirements obtained from targeted audience feedback. As a result, the proposed model is considered inadequate, as it did not receive proper evaluation to ensure it met the needs of the intended audience. Therefore, in this proposed study, the authors aim to incorporate targeted audience feedback to create a stronger foundation for developing a suitable dashboard for top management. Additionally, the study aims to balance the needs of top management with the technicality of the dashboard and the information displayed on it.  
  T. S. Li et al.  
  Mohd Tuah et.al [13] introduced a smart system that uses data analytics and a dashboard to facilitate university students’ self-monitoring, progress tracking, and management of important information related to their final year project. The system was developed using a Rapid Application Development methodology to create the prototype. To ensure that the dashboard meets user requirements, the author utilized Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to measure system acceptance and user behavior intention in using the proposed system. Although TAM has shown significant impacts, it does not fully account for social and contextual factors that may influence technology adoption. TAM primarily focuses on individual users’ perceptions of the technology’s usefulness and ease of use, ignoring how social context and relationships between users and their peers may affect their adoption behavior. Therefore, an alternative model, Datus, was utilized in this paper, which recognizes social influence and trust as critical factors that may influence technology adoption. Datus considers the influence of interpersonal and social network relationships, providing a more comprehensive view of user behavior and representing user feedback towards the dashboard’s quality and usability more accurately.  
  3 Methodology This section outlines the proposed dashboard model development process, which employs Agile methodology to achieve research objectives. The Agile methodology was chosen for this research project due to its suitability in addressing the challenges of changing requirements from stakeholders. The ability for universities to adapt quickly to the uncertainties and fast-paced changes in business is crucial for improving efficiency and meeting stakeholder expectations [14].  
  Fig. 1. Agile software development methodology  
  The Agile methodology employed in this research involved five stages: brainstorming, design, development, quality assurance, and deployment. These stages are illustrated in Fig. 1, and their particulars are as follows: Brainstorm: In the requirement gathering phase, the university’s top management was involved in three iterations of the process. Meetings were held with various stakeholders to identify the necessary information for the dashboard. The framework draft was subjected to an initial iteration, followed by gathering feedback from the strategic and corporate planning division staff member from a higher education institution, and then underwent subsequent revisions. Further feedback was obtained to create the final framework, which formed the basis for the storyboard design.

  in our lives, it is essential to educate Internet users from a young age about Internet safety issues [2]. By fostering a solid cybersecurity knowledge and practices foundation, young people can better navigate the digital world and reduce their vulnerability to potential threats. In addition, Information Technology (IT)-related organizations particularly need robust cybersecurity awareness [3]. Employees in these organizations should be equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to identify, prevent, and respond to cyber threats effectively. By implementing comprehensive CSA programs in educational institutions and IT-related organizations, it can foster a culture of security and vigilance that empowers individuals to protect their digital assets actively. Investing in cybersecurity education and awareness benefits individuals and strengthens the overall security posture of organizations and the broader digital ecosystem. Malware awareness is paramount among higher education students, as cybercriminals often target them due to their limited experience and knowledge in dealing with digital threats [4]. In addition, the prevalence of malware attacks on college and university networks has been steadily increasing, with institutions reporting numerous incidents involving ransomware, phishing, and other forms of malicious software [5]. Given the vast amount of sensitive information stored in educational institutions, students must be well-informed about the risks and types of malware and how to protect themselves [2]. Therefore, educational institutions are critical in equipping students with the necessary skills to identify and avoid malware threats [6]. By incorporating malware awareness into their cybersecurity curriculum, higher education institutions can ensure that students develop a solid understanding of the primary attack vectors and the proactive steps they can take to secure their devices and data [4]. Furthermore, regular training sessions and workshops can help students stay up-to-date with the latest malware trends and defense strategies [7]. The lack of malware awareness among students can have severe consequences for individuals and higher learning institutions [8]. On a personal level, students unaware of malware prevention strategies risk exposing sensitive data, such as academic records and financial information, to cyber criminals [6]. Malware attacks can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and damaged reputations, affecting students’ prospects and wellbeing. Higher learning institutions also suffer from the consequences of inadequate malware awareness [9]. Generally, cyberattacks can compromise institutional data, disrupt academic activities, and erode the institution’s credibility. Furthermore, the financial costs of recovering from a cyberattack can be immense, diverting resources from essential academic programs [7]. Given these potential consequences, this study aims to investigate and develop suitable and relevant malware awareness programs for higher-education students. Although organizations conducted awareness programs, limited studies were conducted on the effectiveness of the materials and the methods of conducting these programs. While the importance of malware awareness is recognized, there is a need for more comprehensive research that evaluates the specific materials, resources, and instructional approaches employed in these programs. On the other hand, equipping the students with the knowledge to recognize and prevent cyber threats can foster a more secure digital environment, safeguard personal and institutional data, and promote academic success [10]. Investing in the research and

  approximately ten to twelve minutes, ensuring a concise and focused material delivery. Subsequently, a ‘Question and Answer’ (Q&A) session was conducted, fostering open dialogue and addressing students’ concerns or queries. Finally, post-test questionnaires containing identical questions to the pre-test were administered to the students after the Q&A session. The post-test evaluated the student’s knowledge and understanding of malware prevention strategies due to exposing them to the malware awareness material. They were also encouraged to provide open-ended comments on the awareness program. This valuable feedback would inform the program’s continual refinement and improvement for future iterations. Figure 2 illustrates the procedure for the malware awareness program.  
  Fig. 2. The procedure of the awareness program  
  The results of the pre-test and post-test assessments of the malware awareness program provide valuable insights into the program’s effectiveness in enhancing knowledge of malware prevention strategies among higher learning institution students. The results show that the program has successfully improved students’ knowledge of various aspects of malware prevention. In addition, the improvements in the scores across the ten questions indicate that the program has effectively addressed misconceptions and enhanced knowledge in areas such as identifying security attacks, understanding malware-spreading mechanisms, and avoiding risky online behavior. The effectiveness of the malware awareness program can be measured by the significant improvements in the post-test scores compared to the pre-test scores. The results highlight the program’s success in achieving its objectives and providing students with the necessary knowledge and skills to protect themselves from malware attacks. The program’s success can also be attributed to its focus on delivery techniques, such as group discussions and presentations. These techniques have been proven effective in enhancing knowledge retention and promoting active learning [18]. Overall, the results of the pre-test and post-test assessments demonstrate the effectiveness of the malware awareness program in improving college students’ knowledge of malware prevention strategies. Again, the program’s success can be attributed to its engaging delivery techniques, which have enhanced knowledge retention and promoted active learning. In conclusion, the malware awareness program has enriched college students’ ability to recognize and combat malware threats. Furthermore, by addressing the students’ diverse levels of understanding, the program has successfully cultivated a more secure and informed digital environment for its participants.  
  5 Conclusion In conclusion, the malware awareness program has successfully improved college students’ understanding of malware prevention strategies. The significant improvements in the post-test scores compared to the pre-test scores highlight the program’s efficacy in addressing misconceptions and enhancing knowledge in various aspects of malware prevention. The results also emphasize the importance of engaging delivery techniques, such as group discussions, case studies, and interactive presentations, which have been proven effective in enhancing knowledge retention and promoting active learning. However, while the malware awareness program has achieved notable success, there is room for future improvements to ensure that students are well-equipped to protect themselves from the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats. One area of potential future work could be the development of more advanced and adaptive learning modules that consider the students’ existing knowledge and tailor the content accordingly. It would provide a more personalized learning experience and could help improve students’ understanding of malware prevention strategies. Additionally, hands-on activities, such as simulated malware attacks or practical exercises in identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities [19], could further enhance students’ skills and reinforce the knowledge gained from the program. It may also be beneficial to explore integrating the malware awareness program into the core curriculum of college courses, ensuring that all students have access to this essential knowledge  
  5 Conclusion In our study, a comparative evaluation was carried out to analyze and compare existing works in ITS, specifically to gauge how feedback was provided to students and the technique used in modeling the student model. Table 1 has depicted the feedback and hints and the techniques used in various ITSs to support various purposes of student learning. ITSs in the programming domain were created with the goal of assisting in the teaching of programming concepts and algorithms, such as using pseudocode and flowcharts, as well as providing proper guidance for students to write code correctly. The results of the comparative evaluation point to the use of Constraint-Based modeling, Model Tracing, Natural Language Processing, and Deep Learning as student model techniques. While delayed feedback is the most appropriate feedback for helping students learn to code, previous research on The LISP Tutor [5] indicates that instant feedback is also beneficial. However, the feedback message may distract the students, causing them to miss out on the experience of a real programmer. On the other hand, ITS in Computer Science education are primarily designed to assist students in learning programming concepts and algorithms such as pseudocode and flowcharts. Clustering techniques such as Bayesian networks are frequently recommended for these ITS. Many researchers have used this technique, which has been shown to help students by providing appropriate feedback. In ITS, both immediate and delayed feedback can be used to help students learn more effectively.  
  Analysis of the Effectiveness of Feedback Provision  
  exchange of ideas [17] and encourage the creation of innovative and imaginative solutions from diverse perspectives, resulting in a broad and varied range of ideas. Brainwriting potentially reduces the impact of status differentials, interpersonal conflicts, domination by a few members, pressure to conform to group norms and deviations from the main topic [14]. Additionally, it may eliminate production blocking, minimize social loafing, and encourage thoughtful processing of shared ideas [18]. Van Gundy [19] categorized Brainwriting into six types: Nominal Group Technique (NGT), Collective Notebook (NCB), Brainwriting Pool, Pin Cards, BattelleBildmappen-Brainwriting (BBB), and the Successive Integration of Problem Elements (SIL) method. According to van Gundy, the first four techniques are pure Brainwriting since they do not involve group discussion of written ideas during the idea-generation process. In contrast, the last two techniques (battelle-bildmappen-Brainwriting and the SIL method) are hybrids as they incorporate oral brainstorming and silent Brainwriting. Brainwriting is a robust approach to promoting idea generation and collaboration, which can result in more innovative and effective solutions.  
  3 Research Methodology As discussed earlier, this study aims to improve the design of Portal GREaT. The UX approach was used in this study to generate ideas for improving the web application. Therefore, this study conducted a simple e-voting session and a Brainwriting workshop to achieve the goal.  
  Azure. Therefore, the color of the portal will be improved by applying Azure. Apart from that, the study also held a workshop in which participants used the Brainwriting method to generate ideas for improving the web application. A UX research expert led the workshop, and 24 participants from the technical staff are currently working on our project. They had at least three years of experience in web application development. The following section will discuss the findings obtained from the workshop.  
  4 Discussion The goal of the workshop was to put the Brainwriting method into practice. As a result, the following procedures were followed: 1. Defining the Theories The majority of the participants are software developers. They have good programming skills but lack web design. Therefore, the workshop began with the instructor explaining the concept of web design and UX. Then, it continued with an explanation of some characteristics and principles of good design and the importance of UX. The instructor also explained the Brainwriting method and how it can be used for ideas generation. 2. Group Formation Following an introduction to the concepts and theories, the participants were divided into six (6) groups of four (4). 3. Explanation of Problem The project leader was asked to explain the problems that needed to be solved. The leader stated that the application needs to be improved. The existing application was created ad-hoc, and the requirements are constantly changing. As a result, the application’s goal is unclear, and the design is unstructured. When the group clearly understands the problem, they can begin the Brainwriting process. 4. Idea Generation Each team was given a piece of digital paper and asked to write down their ideas using Miro.com as a support tool for implementing the Brainwriting method. Each group is assigned a duration (5 min) to record their ideas on digital platforms. When the timer goes off, each team passes their sheet of paper to the group next to them. The following group reads the ideas and adds their own, building on what has been written previously. This process is repeated until each group has had an opportunity to contribute to each idea. Figure 2 depicts the outcome of this step. 5. Reviewing the Ideas Every group will have a collection of ideas refined and improved by multiple group members by the end of the Brainwriting session. When the Brainwriting session is finished, the group can go over the ideas and try to understand the suggestions made by each group. Table 1 shows the ideas generated by each group.  
  Unlocking the Potential of Enhancing User Experience in Portal GREaT  
  Fig. 2. Findings from the idea generation step  
  6. Prioritization of the Idea After everyone has grasped the ideas generated by each group, all participants are asked to evaluate and prioritize the ideas. The ideas are prioritized based on “Most Rational”, “Most Delightful”, “Darling”, and “Long Shot”, which reflect their feasibility, impact, and alignment with the problem statement. “Most Rational” refers to a decision or action based on logical and objective reasoning without being influenced by emotions or biases. It is the most sensible and reasonable option available. While “Most Delightful” refers to something extremely pleasing, enjoyable, or satisfying. It is the most pleasurable and delightful experience one can have. Then, “Darling” is an endearing term to describe someone or something cherished or beloved. It is often used to express affection or fondness towards a person, pet, or object. Finally, “Long shot” refers to a possibility or outcome that is unlikely or has a low probability of success. It is a risky option or an unlikely event worth attempting but may not be expected to succeed. Figure 3 depicts the outcome of the prioritization process. According to the outcome of this process, most participants agreed that the idea generated by Group 2 is feasible and necessary to implement. Group 2’s concept focuses on improving the design by focusing on various user categories. Users are divided into three groups: graduates, industry, and public users, with each group having different module or feature requirements. Furthermore, the banner size must be reduced. On the other hand, the idea from Group 6 is considered a “Long Shot” where the group proposed additional functions to assist users with disabilities. Adding this functionality is a good idea. However, it may necessitate extra time and budget to implement. In the future, the group can include this functionality, where the features can be identified by  
  Abstract. STEM education is vital in today’s learning curriculum. Incorporating Design Thinking into STEM projects such as smart farming, particularly in rural schools in Malaysia where access to technology and resources are scarce, allow teachers and students to experience an enriching teaching and learning experience. In this paper, we employ the Design Thinking approach to gauge the effectiveness of implementing STEM projects such as smart farming to the teachers and students in rural schools. A survey is carried out to measure the effectiveness of the approach and it is shown that the Design Thinking approach helped both teachers and students to develop innovative solutions to benefit the society. Students and teachers also demonstrate increased creativity, problem-solving skills, empathy, and collaborative learning when they solve STEM problems using the Design Thinking approach. Keywords: STEM Education · Internet of Things · Smart Farming  
  To address this shortcoming, the MCMC-UUM MakerSpace Laboratory in Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM) have designed STEM-related projects to inculcate interests among teachers and students alike. Two schools namely Sekolah Kebangsaan Telaga Mas (Telaga Mas National Primary School) and Sekolah Kebangsaan Sungai Batu (Sungai Batu National Primary School) were chosen to be the pioneer in this project. A smart farming project was initiated in each school where both students and teachers were given the exposure on developing and implementing smart farming based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology based on the Design Thinking [2, 3, 10] approach. The teachers and schoolchildren were assisted by student volunteers from UUM. In this paper, we document the experiences of seven teachers and 20 schoolchildren from both schools, as well as 12 UUM student volunteers who participated in this project. A survey based on the phases in Design Thinking was adapted to gauge the participants understanding on project implementation and reflection from each of them is recorded to gain better insights on the project. The experiences the teachers, schoolchildren and student volunteers undergo would set a pathway and best practices for school and small community development, as well as deliver actionable and sustainable solutions which benefit the community. The research questions and research objectives related to the STEM smart farming project aim to gauge the following: Research Questions 1: How effective is the Design Thinking approach in allowing participants to understand societal problems and formulating a smart farming solution? Research Question 2: How effective is the Design Thinking approach in nurturing creativity, innovation and problem solving among participants of smart farming project? Reflecting on the research questions above, the following research objectives are outlined: Research Objective 1: To investigate the awareness on Design Thinking approach among teachers and students when implementing the smart farming project. Research Objective 2: To investigate the effectiveness of Design Thinking approach in nurturing creativity, innovation and problem solving among teachers and students (participants) in smart farming project. This paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, this paper provides an overview of the related concepts of STEM education, IoT-based smart farming and the implementation of smart farming in both schools. In Sect. 3, this paper describes the sampling and instrument used in this study. The findings and results are then presented in Sect. 4, while Sect. 5 discusses pertinent observations from this study. Section 6 concludes the paper.  
  6 Conclusion STEM education plays an important role in both teaching and learning. It is vital that STEM education is expanded to not only in smart farming, but to include a diverse sector which will bring positive change to the community. A structured teaching approach such a Design Thinking presents opportunities for all to explore various problem-solving approach that can bring benefits to everyone. In this paper, we seek to measure the effectiveness of the Design Thinking approach in implementing a smart farming project. Our findings show that Design Thinking help improve learning experiences. This project, however, has its limitations such as a small number of participants and the projects conducted is is limited to smart farming projects only. In our future work, we aim to have a larger sample and involve various types of projects to cover the diverse communities that the MCMC-UUM MakerSpace Laboratory serves.  
  is described through the desire of a lecturer to assess himself through the emoji he sees on the application screen. When a lecturer has the highest degree of importance or rank / often appears in meeting the needs of completing a student’s final project, the representation of the central core will be present, and present peripheral elements related to shame [16]. 2.3 Shame Humans are taught to have shame since childhood. Some forms of shame such as shame to be disrespectful, and shame to do not comply with the norms adopted by a community. The meaning of the word shame shows that shame is closely related to ethics and morality. Shame as one of the basic emotions, continues to develop according to age levels and social changes that occur. For example, the meaning of shame in the younger generation is related to self-doubt, events that cause negative judgments, non-ideal physical appearance, violations of moral principles and inappropriate etiquette [18]. Shame triggers a person to modify his behavior so that it is easier to adapt to the environment. Shame arises when group performance is higher than personal performance [19]. Shame is a determining factor of social behavior [20]. In several studies in the field of psychology, it was found that shame arises when someone judges himself to feel unable to do something [21], feelings of helplessness and failure [22].  
  Fig. 1. Four steps of action research  
  mind when they heard the word’shame in guiding the final project’. The responses are then ranked by the participants according to their degree of importance. The data obtained by using the hierarchized evocation method can be analyzed in stages, (1) lexical analysis and categorization of the attributes that appear. At this stage, attributes that are semantically the same will be categorized in the same category and then their frequency is calculated, (2) statistical processing by calculating the percentage of the frequency of occurrence of the categorized attributes. The result of calculating the percentage of frequency is accompanied by a sequence of degrees of importance or ranking, which is used as a reference to determine the central core of social representation of “embarrassment in guiding the final project through the ELISTA application”. The responses that often appear and get the highest order in the degree of importance are the central core of social representation, while the responses that appear infrequently but get the highest order in the degree of importance and the responses that occur frequently but get low rankings are not counted as the central core of shame. 3.1 Pre-action There are two activities carried out in the pre-action. The first is to determine the type of response that will be counted as response time. This is important to identify because not all responses from lecturers are counted in response time. The second is to prepare an algorithm for calculating the lecturer’s response time. The pseudocode to calculate the average response time has input in the form of requesting guidance from students, response times from lecturers, other response times if there are responses from students. Lecturer responses are classified in the form of text and text accompanied by files. The time that will be calculated as response time is presented in the following table (Table 1).  
  Enhancing Supervisor Response Time  
  J. Marzal et al.  
  Meanwhile, the calculated baseline component includes the number of applications for supervising, the number of lecturers who have used the Elista application for supervising, the number of lecturers with a small response time of or equal to 2 days, between 2 days to 4 days, between 4 days to 6 days, between 6 to 8 days, and large from 8 days. 3.2 First Cycle This research aims to address the issue of extended response times among lecturers. To achieve this, the researchers first categorize the lecturer response times based on their speed of response, relying on past experience to determine the classification. Typically, the supervising lecturer provides guidance once a week. After processing the data on lecturer response times, specific actions were undertaken to tackle the problem.: 1. Create a feature to display the response time with the information submitted are: • If the average response time is small equal to 2 days, then the message that appears is Very Good in the green box, • If the average response time is more than 2 days and up to 4 days, the message that appears is Good in the blue box, • If the average response time is more than 4 days and up to 6 days then the message that appears is Normal in the yellow box, • If the average response time is more than 6 days and up to 8 days, the message that appears is the response time is Poor in the orange box, • If the average response time is more than 8 days then the message that appears is the response time is Very Poor in the red box, • And if you don’t have a response time, the message that appears is “you don’t have a response time” in the black box. 2. To strengthen the message about the response time zone, the service zone is equipped with text and emoji. Emojis can express emotions [24], and feelings easily [25]. 3. Disseminate the feature to all lecturers through various WhatsApp groups of lecturers and leaders. After the socialization is carried out, the response time reflection feature is applied within one month. The subjects in this study were all lecturers. At the end of cycle one, the researcher re-measured the response time and the number of lecturers who used Elista as a guidance tool. Figure 3 is an example of the response time display on a supervisor’s user account. 3.3 Second Cycle Based on the evaluation of the first cycle, the thing that will be done to increase response time is to display personal response times and peer response times on a supervisor’s account. It is hoped that with friends in one work unit seeing the response time, everyone will try to increase their respective response times. The information displayed is the name of the lecturer, the number of responses, the time, and the response zone. With this display, people may try to manipulate their behavior to avoid embarrassment by speeding up response times.  
  Enhancing Supervisor Response Time  
  Fig. 4. Percentage of users and response time per cycle.  
  From Fig. 4 above, it can be seen that there is an increase in the percentage of lecturers who have a response time and the percentage of supervisors who have a response time of a minimum normal category. Based on this graph, it can be temporarily concluded that displaying personal response times on a supervisor’s personal account that can be seen by the lecturer or colleagues in a study program can increase the response time. Supervisors will try to increase their response time so they do not feel embarrassed if they are labeled as slow lecturers in responding to the needs of student assignments. Meanwhile, the display of group response times will also encourage supervisors to increase their response times. This is based on group shame where the lecturer jointly avoids group shame. As a triangulation of the conclusions obtained above, an open questionnaire was distributed to the supervisors. This activity aims to find out the central core of shame in managing the final project. The response percentage is called high if it is greater than 10%, and the response ranking is called a high category if it is smaller than 2. These criteria are determined arbitrarily. Central core shame is the response of respondents who belong to the category of high percentage and high ranking. Based on the information in the following table, the central cores in the management of the final project are: 1) embarrassed if the personal response time is red, and 2) the work unit response time is red (Table 2).

  final projects. By prioritizing response times and fostering effective communication, educational institutions can create an enriched and streamlined learning experience that benefits both lecturers and students alike. As we move forward, it is essential to embrace these findings and explore innovative approaches to further enhance academic practices and elevate the overall quality of education through platforms like ELISTA.  
  Abstract. School disengagement is one of the pressing topics for educational equity in many countries worldwide, which will lead to school dropout. Dropping out of school has adverse consequences, including negative effects on employment, lifetime earnings, and physical health. Several attempts have been made to solve engagement issues, for example, the development of an intelligent tutoring system (ITS), which is useful to know when a student has disengaged from a task and might benefit from a particular intervention. However, predicting disengagement on a trial-by-trial basis is a challenging problem, particularly in complex cognitive domains. This paper emphasizes the MyBuddy mobile application developed as a smart classifier to identify the level of school disengagement risk among at-risk students in secondary schools. The working engine of MyBuddy is translated from a computational model that comprises fourteen predictors of four main entities: student, family, school, and surroundings. This application employs advanced mathematical models to analyze the data and generate risk scores indicating the dropout likelihood. This empowers counselors to proactively intervene and provide targeted support to the students who require it the most. MyBuddy offers a centralized platform to access and analyze aggregated data from multiple schools. This functionality allows them to smartly identify patterns, trends, and systemic challenges contributing to dropout rates. With comprehensive datadriven insights, district and state officers can design effective interventions and allocate resources strategically to mitigate dropout risks.

  24 November 2022, 10 August 2022, and 6 October 2022, respectively. To begin with, low-fidelity wireframes and mockups were developed to visually represent the app’s overall structure, layout, and navigation. These initial prototypes served as a foundation for gathering feedback and insights from the end users. The prototypes were then shared with school counselors, district officers, and state officers, who were the primary users of the MyBuddy app. Through interviews, focus groups, and usability testing sessions, the users were encouraged to explore the prototypes and provide feedback on various aspects of the design, functionality, and user experience. The feedback obtained from the users was meticulously analyzed, considering their suggestions, concerns, and observations. The development team carefully considered the feedback and identified areas where improvements could be made to enhance the app’s usability, effectiveness, and user satisfaction. This analysis phase involved comparing the users’ expectations and preferences with the existing design, allowing a deeper understanding of the users’ needs and goals. Based on the insights gained from the feedback analysis, subsequent design iterations were created, incorporating the suggested improvements and addressing the identified issues. These iterations gradually refined the app’s design, ensuring it aligned more closely with the users’ requirements and expectations. The development team actively engaged with the users throughout the iterative process, fostering a collaborative and participatory environment. Regular feedback sessions and usability testing allowed for ongoing dialogue and knowledge exchange between the development team and the end users. This iterative feedback loop ensured that the design decisions were grounded in user insights and that the app evolved in response to user needs. Figure 1 illustrates selected interfaces of MyBuddy application. By embracing an iterative design process, MyBuddy benefited from continuous user input, enabling the development team to create a user-friendly interface and improve the overall user experience. The iterative approach allowed for a gradual refinement of the app’s design and functionality, ensuring that it effectively addressed the needs and constraints of school counselors, district officers, and state officers involved in dropout prevention efforts. 4.3 Development of MyBuddy Application MyBuddy prototype is developed based on the requirements garnered during requirement gathering sessions. Sketches and wireframes with a low level of detail were developed to illustrate the underlying architecture of the application as well as the user flows. Subsequently, a high-fidelity prototype was meticulously developed using Android Studio, allowing for a vivid visualization of the application’s interface and functionality. A database is created for this application to store students’ data that will be used to detect their risk of school dropout. This prototype will undergo extensive testing, including the incorporation of priceless user input and incremental modifications. Ultimately, it serves as the basis for the subsequent phase of large-scale development that will come after it. Figure 2 illustrates the main interface of MyBuddy application with fourteen predictors. Data of students need to be keyed in by School Counsellors. It involves 14 variables belonging to four main entities: students, family background, peers, and surrounding

  flag, medium risk is indicated with a yellow flag, while low risk will be indicated with a green flag, as shown in Fig. 3(a). District and State Education Officers can also view the whole report of student risk, as shown in Fig. 3(b). 4.4 Evaluation of MyBuddy Evaluation of MyBuddy application involves four steps: technical testing, usability testing, acceptance testing, and market testing. Technical testing was conducted on 25 July 2023 involving IT experts from different institutions on three dimensions: design and layout, interactions and simplicity, and functions and performance. The results of technical testing indicate a positive response by IT Experts. However, the experts give comments on improving the application in each dimension. Based on the results and technical testing feedback, the MyBuddy application’s improved version has been produced and will be used in other upcoming tests.  
  5 Challenges of MyBuddy Implementation Implementing MyBuddy may face challenges such as technological infrastructure limitations, data management and privacy concerns, user training and adoption difficulties, stakeholder engagement, integration with existing systems, cultural and contextual factors, resource allocation, scalability and sustainability, evaluation and continuous improvement, and stakeholder communication and buy-in. 5.1 Ethical Issue Integrating MyBuddy and similar applications in education raises important ethical considerations that must be carefully addressed. This section discusses three primary ethical concerns associated with using these applications: data privacy, bias in modeling, and potential stigmatization of students. By exploring these considerations, educators, policymakers, and developers can better understand the challenges and work towards ensuring such technology’s responsible and ethical use. One of the key ethical concerns when utilizing applications like MyBuddy is the protection of students’ data privacy. These applications collect and analyze sensitive information, such as attendance records, academic performance, and social indicators, to identify at-risk students. Implementing robust data privacy measures to safeguard this information and ensure compliance with applicable data protection regulations is crucial. Schools, developers, and policymakers must establish clear guidelines and protocols for data collection, storage, access, and sharing to maintain confidentiality and protect students’ personal information. Another ethical consideration is the potential for bias in the mathematical models used by applications like MyBuddy. The algorithms and models to predict dropout probabilities should be developed and tested carefully for fairness, accuracy, and inclusivity. It is essential to critically examine the training data used to develop these models to prevent the reinforcement or amplification of biases that may exist within the educational

  Abstract. The growth of e-commerce has brought about a growing concern regarding its impact on the environment. Activities such as excessive packaging, delivery, and returns have contributed to increased carbon emissions, resulting in a significant carbon footprint. To promote a sustainable e-commerce environment, a study is needed to assess the carbon footprint contribution of online businesses. This paper presents a framework for conducting a preliminary investigation into the carbon production and emissions of identified e-commerce organizations. The framework was formulated by analyzing the relevant literature from similar studies. It comprises a 3-phase research activity: Phase 1 involves identifying carbon footprint factors through a literature search; Phase 2 includes conducting a case study on an online business to construct a carbon consumption profile; and Phase 3 involves developing a measurement method to assess the carbon consumption of online businesses. The proposed framework can provide a preliminary understanding of e-commerce’s carbon footprint contribution and enable authorities to assess the level of carbon consumption and devise action plans to reduce its impact on the environment. However, challenges and implications are associated with implementing the framework, which is discussed in the paper.

  the advancements in Internet technology, online payment security, and speedy delivery methods. The covid-19 pandemic also contributes to the demand for online shopping. The positive growth of e-Commerce has resulted in various benefits to the economy. However, there is a need to ensure that the sector players do not harm the environment due to the activities of searching, packaging, shipping, and returning items [4]. Research shows e-commerce players contribute to carbon production and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The negative effects of e-commerce on the environment are increasing due to the problem of transporting individual shipments, using special packaging materials, and issues with product returns [5]. For instance, in terms of packaging, online retailers’ continuous use of cardboard, plastics, Styrofoam, and other packaging materials when shipping their products generates a continuous stream of waste. Besides excessive packaging waste pollution, the carbon emissions due to the transportation (delivery and return) activities associated with online purchasing also harm the environment. Studies on the environmental impact of e-commerce are diverse as researchers focus on different angles such as logistics [5–7], particularly the last mile delivery i.e. the process of shipping the products from delivery hubs directly to the customer’s door [8, 9]. Research also focuses on e-commerce consumer behavior and its environmental impact [10, 11]. Assessing the environmental impact of e-commerce is a non-trivial task due to the different factors and elements contributing to the problem. Furthermore, the emergence of new retail models such as omnichannel retail incorporating click-and-collect and ship-from-store functionalities, along with the introduction of new delivery services, has added to the complexity in understanding the e-commerce industry’s environmental impact [12]. Promoting sustainable carbon consumption practices among online businesses is the ultimate goal of the authorities. With long-term economic growth in mind, a comprehensive plan that consists of standards, taxes, subsidies, communications campaigns, and education needs to be devised. To come up with this plan, a preliminary investigation needs to be performed to understand the severity of the situation. This paper provides a framework that can be used to perform a preliminary investigation on the existing scenario of the e-commerce industry toward building a carbon footprint profile for it. The framework outlines the preliminary investigation’s objective, method, and output in three phases. Using this framework, a preliminary investigation of e-commerce carbon footprint contribution can be performed to build a model that can aid in promoting sustainable carbon consumption among e-commerce. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews relevant literature and discusses how carbon footprint has been defined and explored in previous research. Section 3 presents the proposed framework to perform a preliminary investigation of the current scenario of carbon footprint contribution among e-commerce. Section 4 discusses the challenges and impact of implementing the framework, and Sect. 5 concludes the paper.

  For rail, air and sea transport:  
  where E is Emissions (kg CO2e), F is fuel consumption (liters) D is the distance traveled (km) and Ef is Emission factor (kg CO2e/liter for road or kg CO2e/km for rail, or kg CO2e/km/passenger for air and kg CO2e/km/tonne for sea), In each case, the emission factor is a value that reflects the amount of greenhouse gas emitted per unit of fuel or distance traveled. Regression Analysis. Shopping online has the potential to reduce the environmental impact compared to traditional brick-and-mortar retail, although the degree of impact depends on specific circumstances. However, due to the complexity of the factors involved, most studies that compare the carbon footprints of online and traditional retail provide a limited view. To provide a more comprehensive assessment, a study published

  ti software. The secondary data will be subjected to content analysis. The participants will be determined by contacting the liaison officers or representatives at Lazada through LinkedIn and their company website. 3.3 Phase 3: Developing Carbon Contribution Measurement Method The third phase is to propose a measurement method and matrix suitable to measure carbon contribution for e-Commerce, logistics, and courier players based on best practices and industry standards across other sectors and/or jurisdictions. To achieve this objective, a literature search will be conducted on the best practice and industry standards in other countries or other sectors to devise the carbon contribution calculation. The output of this phase will be the measurement method for carbon contribution calculation for retailers, logistics, and courier players. The literature revealed various approaches for measuring carbon contribution, therefore, this phase will involve a thorough search of the literature to identify the most suitable approach. Once the approach is identified, the next step is to conduct an analytical approach on the identified carbon contributing factors and elements from Phase 1 and the carbon profile of the identified online business from Phase 2. Both this information will be analyzed to be incorporated into the construction of the carbon footprint measurement method.  
  4 Implementation Challenges and Impact The paper presents a framework for the preliminary investigation of the e-commerce carbon footprint contribution. This section discusses some challenges that may arise in implementing the proposed framework. We also discuss the implication of implementing the preliminary investigation using the proposed framework. 4.1 Implementation Challenges Conducting a preliminary investigation related to carbon footprint profiling of ecommerce comes with challenges such as data acquisition, ensuring the sufficiency of data to create the carbon footprint profile and the challenges of developing a model with insufficient data. One of the main challenges in conducting research related to carbon footprint profiling is gaining access to relevant organizations and their data. Acquiring data from these organizations can be difficult, especially if the organization is unwilling to cooperate or if the data is confidential. Also, it may be challenging to contact some organizations, which might make the research process more challenging. Researchers may need to build relationships with pertinent groups, explain the significance of the research and the advantages of participation, and reassure them that their data would be handled with privacy and security in mind to solve this difficulty. The unavailability of adequate data to build a model is another problem in carbon footprint profiling research. This is particularly true for small and medium-sized businesses, which could lack the tools or capability needed to gather and disclose information  
  S. S. Kamruddin et al.  
  on their carbon impact. Furthermore, it may be difficult to develop the model because of missing or faulty data effectively. We could need to leverage various data sources, including publicly available databases or secondary data, to address this problem, and we might need to create statistical models to estimate the missing data. Even with the best efforts, there may occasionally not be enough data to build a carbon footprint model. This could happen if the company hasn’t gathered data on particular parts of its operations or if the data is unreliable or erroneous. We may need to employ alternate strategies to study the potential effects of missing data in certain situations, such as creating scenario-based models or performing sensitivity analyses. Another strategy is to use proxy data, such as industry benchmarks or data from organizations with comparable purposes, to calculate carbon emissions. 4.2 The Impact of Implementation When the framework is implemented, the outcome of the preliminary investigation can provide the following implication; by identifying the contributing factors of the carbon footprint and constructing a carbon footprint profile for the e-commerce industry and its players, the preliminary investigation can provide valuable insights into the current practices and the severity of the existing carbon footprint produced by e-commerce companies. This information can help businesses make informed decisions about reducing their carbon emissions and developing more sustainable practices. For example, the researchers can identify which activities and processes have the highest carbon footprint and suggest ways to reduce emissions through changes in these areas. The development of a measurement/model/matrix can be used as a measuring scale to measure and evaluate the future carbon footprint contribution of the e-commerce industry. Furthermore, it may be used to create a standard and compare the carbon footprint of different companies and industries. Another benefit of the measurement/model/matrix is that it can be used to monitor carbon reduction progress and set achievable targets over time. This could motivate businesses to take action to lessen their carbon footprint and foster a culture of sustainability within the e-commerce sector.  
  5 Conclusion In conclusion, a carbon footprint profiling study can significantly benefit the e-commerce industry by providing a guideline to reduce carbon emissions and contribute to environmental sustainability. Establishing relationships with organizations, using different data sources, and devising alternative solutions can overcome the challenges faced in this research, such as gaining access to relevant organizations, dealing with incomplete data, and having difficulty adopting innovative modeling approaches. Identifying the contributing factors and constructing a carbon footprint profile can enable the e-commerce industry to gain insights into their operations’ carbon emissions, enabling them to make informed decisions on reducing their carbon footprint. Additionally, constructing a carbon footprint measurement/model/matrix can be viewed as an initiative to develop a standardized and transparent method of assessing carbon consumption, setting targets for reduction, and monitoring progress over time.

  Abstract. The significance of financial planning in individuals’ lives cannot be understated. People are transitioning from traditionally paper-based or tangible methods of tracking their finances to more digital-based approaches. However, recent studies indicate that the study on personal financial management systems is limited, and the traditional software did not meet the users’ needs. The current software lacks the ability to offer practical recommendations to users and direct them towards achieving their financial objectives. This study aims to design a personal financial management software that implements artificial intelligence techniques. A rule-based expert system technique was adopted to provide practical recommendations and support users in achieving their financial goals. Besides that, a prototype of the proposed system will be developed and evaluated by domain experts using a user perception survey. The results reveal that the respondents are satisfied with the design of the proposed system. The outcome of this study could provide practical recommendations that users can use to make informed financial decisions and accomplish their financial objectives.

  assets. It is an essential skill that needs to be learned and practised because it enables people to achieve their life goals. While managing personal finances is important, only some have the knowledge or capability to do this. Besides, even the most economically astute person can become confused or short-sighted. Munohsamy [2] explains the significance of personal financial management, stating that it allows for a higher standard of living, which leads to better health and less financial stress. Muske & Winter [3] also mention that long-term financial security is seen to be possible with good personal financial management. However, they discovered that only a few individuals applied the suggested personal money management strategies. Technology-related tools are believed to make personal financial management easier in daily life. People now, especially the younger generation, are expected to be able to adapt to technology in managing their finances. According to Hokin [4] spending without limits and goals is the biggest problem in personal finance. This issue may be solved when someone specifies their purpose with supporting tools that are able to manage their own personal finance. Therefore, when developing a personal financial management application for the users to support money management and decision making, it is critical to understand what they want to do so that these applications meet their needs and expectations rather than imagined ones. This research aims to (i) determine the requirements of the prototype for a rulebased personal financial management expert system, (ii) construct a prototype for a rule-based personal financial management expert system. (iii) evaluate the rule-based personal financial management expert system prototype.  
  2 Problem Statement Personal finance can help people better understand where money is spent and where it comes from. The user can draw conclusions based on this information and make better decisions for better financial capability. Moreover, it is important for an individual to understand that planning and budgeting can help avoid problems, such as overspending and budget gaps, especially for those with debt or loans. Next, the requirements for personal financial control keep increasing, and it is impossible for everyone to keep a lot of information in mind simultaneously. The main problem with personal finance is that people spend without knowing their limits and without having a plan. Therefore, many people start analysing their expenditures and budget. Unfortunately, there are some people who lack the time and information to deal with this. According to Vasyliuk & Basyuk [5], people sometimes only know the approximate value of their expenditure. However, the real statistics of the financial data are different from this figure. Vahidov & He [6] also highlight concerning trends in the personal finance domain that researchers have overlooked. Therefore, there is a need for a system that can help users keep track of and manage their financial data. However, the current study on the personal financial management system is still limited, especially in the requirement model for a personal financial management system. According to Lewis & Perry [7], the study on how users track their financial transaction every day is very limited, and little is known about how users keep track of their

  daily financial activities. Although some existing commercial software, such as Manilla, Quicken and FinanceWorks, currently supports personal financial management, they found out that most of the software was not used by users due to a mismatch with the needs, security, and inconvenience. They also show that the fulfilment of the users’ needs and requirements are the keys to successful personal financial management software. Moreover, the current commercial application requires in-app purchases and a high monthly subscription to function properly which is not affordable for most users [8]. In addition, Xie [9] found that most traditional software consists of meaningless operations and redundant functions. They suggest that personal financial management software users should focus on the data rather than spend energy and time to understand the complex user interface. This is supported by Kozhevnikov et al. [10], which mention that most of the current popular personal financial management applications have been created for a long time with outdated technology, inflexible user interfaces and a lack of important features. They also mention there is a need to identify the requirement or design for creating a next generation personal financial management information system. Apart from that, the current personal finance application lacks the capability to provide users with actionable advice [11]. As a result, the application cannot guide users towards achieving financial stability. Considering that most users make purchase decisions based on unconscious factors is crucial. ABased on the literature reviewed above, further research is still needed, particularly in designing an effective personal financial management system. To address this gap, this study proposes a new design for a personal financial management system that leverages AI capabilities to offer practical recommendations and support users in making informed decisions to achieve their financial goals.  
  3 Related Work According to Nafed [12], expert systems are classified as one of the most significant areas of artificial intelligence. It can be considered an artificial intelligence technique [13]. An expert system is an intelligent computer program that utilizes knowledge and inference techniques to address complex problems that typically require consultation with domain experts. In the same context, Jackson [14] defined an expert system as a software application that utilises knowledge and reasoning of a specialised subject matter to solve problems or provide advice. Giarratano & Riley [15] suggest that an expert system consists of two distinct components: an inference engine and a knowledge base. Moreover, Holsapple et al. [16] suggested the application of an expert system in financial management, including portfolio analysis, credit analysis, insurance, and security trading. In this study, a comparison and analysis will be conducted among three popular personal financial management applications, namely Money Manager, Dollarbird, and Goodbudget. Additionally, the important requirements of this application will be identified and elicited. Table 1 shows the results of the comparative analysis based on observations.  
  /  
  Based on the findings presented in Table 1, this study reveals that the selected popular personal finance management application could store and visualise the daily transaction of the users. However, these applications cannot revise the budget and provide actionable advice to users. As a result, this study reaches a similar conclusion to the study conducted by Althnian [11], which mentioned that these applications lack the ability to lead users to financial wellness. The common features of these applications such as adding, modifying, and visualising transaction will be gathered, analysed, and transformed into the requirements of the proposed system. In summary, expert systems can be used in a wide area of application, especially in financial management. The main reason is that it can be used to solve problems related to control, simulation, selection, design, prescription, diagnosis, planning, prediction, monitoring, and others [12]. The proposed system will focus on the area of personal financial planning due to the limited study in that domain. Personal finance management is an important domain researcher always overlook [6]. Apart from that, the problemsolving paradigm of the proposed expert system will be planning.  
  4 Methodology The research methodology used in a study is determined by the research objectives and the consideration by the researcher [17]. The mixed research approach, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative methods, will be employed in this study for data collection and analysis. The requirements will first be obtained through qualitative means such as observation and document analysis, followed by the creation of a prototype to demonstrate these requirements. The validity of the design will then be evaluated quantitatively. The study will adhere to the Design Science Research in Information Systems framework proposed by Vaishnavi & Kuechler [18], a widely adopted approach in various fields including computer science and engineering, as depicted in the accompanying Fig. 1.

  After Tim records his financial transactions, the system enables him to sort and visualise his financial data using various charts through the analysis module. As an example, Fig. 8 shows the pie chart of Tim’s expenditure categories in 2023. Figure 9 displays the visualisation of Tim’s expenditures using a bar chart for the year 2022. Additionally, the system will calculate the average expenditure for each transaction. Furthermore, the analysis module of the system will summarise Tim’s financial data and enable him to view his personal financial report, as illustrated in Fig. 10.  
  1 Introduction Rice is a staple food for many people worldwide, including Malaysians. Meeting domestic rice demand is difficult because of distracting variables such as rising population, changes in land use, soil quality, weather patterns, plantation diseases, and restricted access to innovation, technologies, and resources [2, 3]. A reliable system for forecasting future rice yield is required to achieve food security. However, because of the variability of the factors influencing rice output, developing a one-size-fits-all forecasting model is difficult. Moreover, the conventional practice often relies on historical data and expert recommendations and may not consider all factors influencing rice production in forecasting rice yields [17]. To overcome these challenges, machine learning approaches appear as recent alternatives to build prediction models for crop yields. It has a wider ability to capture complex relationships between various characteristics and may incorporate massive amounts of data, such as climate data. However, further study is needed in Malaysia on the utility of integrating weather-related information into machine learning models for rice crop prediction. In recent years, there has been a rise in interest in using machine learning approaches to create prediction models for crop output [2–4] and examine the influence of climate on agricultural productivity. Due to the continuous interaction of various variables impacting rice production, predicting rice yields using machine learning models can be challenging. Climate is one of the impacting factors in agriculture, including rice. A previous study has revealed that climatic conditions influence rice production in Malaysia [2, 3]. However, it is unclear how much climatic data can increase the accuracy of rice crop estimates in Malaysia. This study investigates the effectiveness of including climate data in predicting rice production in Malaysia using linear regression. Our hypothesis was that including climate data in the prediction model could increase the accuracy of rice yield estimation in Malaysia, as climate is crucial to rice production. This study aims to provide insights into the possible benefits of integrating climate data for rice production prediction in Malaysia by including it in a regression model. In relation to this, the yearly rice yield information, as well as season indicators for the main and secondary plantation seasons of 10 years from states in Malaysia, were employed in the modeling. In addition, climatic data as predictors such as wind speed, temperature, humidity, and rainfall were also included in the model. This study is organized as follows: a complete overview of related studies, methodology, findings, and a discussion of the research’s significance for agricultural practices and future research in Malaysia. The study is expected to contribute to the growing body of literature on the impact of climate change on agriculture in Malaysia, as well as give important insights for policymakers and farmers in this country.

  distribution, and pricing decisions. Traditional approaches to yield prediction have relied on statistical models and expert knowledge. However, recent advances in machine learning and data science have led to the development of more accurate predictive models for crop yields [5]. Rice yield prediction models can be modeled based on three approaches that are mechanistic, statistical/machine learning, and deep learning-based [19]. Regression modeling is a popular technique under statistical machine learning models for developing predictive models in agriculture. Regression models aim to establish a relationship between a dependent variable (in this case, crop yield) and one or more independent variables (such as climate data, soil quality, and agricultural practices). Regression models can be simple or complex, depending on the number and type of independent variables used. The quality of the data and the correlation among the variables used to generate the model might have an impact on regression performance. [6]. There has been growing interest in using regression models to predict crop yields with climate data recently. Climate factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind speed are essential predictors of crop yields in many regions [7]. By incorporating climate data into regression models, researchers have developed more accurate and reliable predictions of crop yields [2, 3]. [18] replicated factors influencing rice production by combining typical independent variables such as temperature, precipitation, sunlight hours, and relative humidity to develop a deep learning-based rice yield forecast model. Other rice yield prediction models based on deep learning can be seen in [19]. In Malaysia, machine learning in combination with climatic data has proved very useful for predicting rice yields. As a staple crop, thus forecasting rice harvests is critical for guaranteeing food security and economic stability [1]. In Malaysia, researchers discovered that adding climate data into regression models may greatly increase the accuracy of rice yield predictions [2, 3]. Because climate involves many types of predictors, an experiment using a different climate predictor may yield a different result. This study emphasizes the need of using climate variables when developing forecast models for rice yields in Malaysia. To summaries, regression modeling and the integration of climate information are important input for predicting crop yields in agriculture. Regression models may be used to create correlations between dependent and independent variables, and using climate data as an independent variable can enhance forecast accuracy. In the context of rice production prediction in Malaysia, adding climate data has shown to be a significant method for boosting forecast accuracy and guaranteeing food security in the country.  
  3 Methodology This study’s methodology section focuses on predicting rice yields in Malaysia using regression modelling techniques, with a particular emphasis on the role of climate data in this process. We employed a series of steps to achieve this, including data collection and analysis, data preparation, and regression modelling. Figure 1 provides a flowchart of these steps and their interconnectedness in the overall process.  
  Abstract. The gig economy has paved the way for sharing economy growth especially e-hailing applications, as more women turn to e-hailing applications for convenience in commuting and travelling. However, women are concerned about whether to trust or not to trust e-hailing applications due to the openness of their digital and spatial crowdsourcing nature. Additionally, the user’s locations are exposed to risks like stalking, identity theft, and physical safety, which can be extremely dangerous, especially for women. The paper begins by introducing the e-hailing industry and the gig economy. It then discusses women’s unique challenges in using e-hailing applications and their trust towards these platforms. This paper dives deep into the heart of the matter by employing a quantitative approach through the survey to investigate women’s trust in e-hailing apps using the UTAUT as the underpinning theory. The results show that e-hailing applications greatly influence women’s trust while puzzlingly having no significant impact on their trust towards e-hailing drivers. From eye-opening insights to practical recommendations, this study sheds light on the crucial role of trust in the sustainable growth of the e-hailing industry focusing on women. Keywords: Gig economy · E-hailing · Trust · Risk · UTAUT · women in sharing economy  
  Nowadays, e-hailing services are in great demand as they have many advantages from a consumer perspective [2]. E-hailing applications have provided women with greater mobility options, enabling them to navigate urban environments conveniently and safely. The e-hailing platforms provides transparent driver information and ease of requesting rides for women as alternatives to traditional taxis [3]. However, there are possibilities of risks involved such as physical safety like driver’s inappropriate behaviour [4], assaults and harassment in sharing rides services [5]. Thus, addressing women’s safety concerns is needed from both e-hailing companies and society. Companies must prioritize implementing strict policies and comprehensive training programs to foster a safe and respectful environment for passengers and drivers. Furthermore, data privacy concerns loom large in the digital era. E-hailing applications collect vast amounts of personal information from users, including location data, contact details, and transaction history. Women users, in particular, may be at risk of potential misuse or unauthorized access to their data [6]. The success of the E-hailing application is dependent upon the active participation of all customers, including women, who represent the target group selected for the current study. Likewise, customer trust has a major role in the success of applications, including E-hailing applications in particular, where trust is an attribute that develops over time due to customer interactions, and trust varies according to the application areas. For example, trust varies from the woman’s perspective [7]. In the online booking (E-hailing) application, privacy and security are two important factors for achieving trust. At the same time, there are negative factors affecting the success of E-hailing applications that can be identified by risks, including physical risks represented by sexual harassment, murder, kidnapping, and hate crimes, and the risks of hacking sensitive information of women by the platform itself, as it works through smart mobile phones and other devices that are often its security are weak and result in many risks [3, 8]. Most studies in this domain focus on the economic aspects and ignore the risks, despite various reported security incidents related to e-hailing applications like Uber, Grab, etc. [8]. Risks associated with e-hailing may influence women’s trust in e-hailing platforms. A useful theoretical framework for researching the adoption of technology, particularly e-hailing apps, is the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) by Venkatesh et al. [9] which help to provide a thorough understanding of users’ intention to embrace and use technology. It includes important constructs from multiple technology acceptance models. The relevance and applicability of UTAUT in predicting and explaining user acceptance of e-hailing services have been shown in studies such as in Liu et al. [10]. Thus, this article unpacks the relationship between women’s trust and the adoption of e-hailing applications through the lens of UTAUT theory.  
  2 Literature Review 2.1 E-Hailing The rise of the gig economy has shown significant adoption of digital technology such as e-hailing applications. E-hailing applications allow people to book rides services through mobile or internet-based applications at a specific time and at an appropriate price [2]. With the launch of an application-based electronic recall service, the public  
  RO2: To examine the influence of women’s trust in drivers on their intentions to use e-hailing applications. RO3: To investigate the moderating effect of risk on women’s trust in e-hailing applications and drivers on their intentions to use e-hailing applications. This study employed a quantitative approach using a survey for data collection. The study developed a questionnaire instrument that distinguished between trusting the e-hailing application and trusting the drivers. The survey consisted of 22 questions and collected demographic data from participants using four data structures. Responses were measured using a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from ‘strongly disagree’ (1) to ‘strongly agree’ (7). Table 1 provides an overview of the final miscatalogue, including combinations and relevant item codes. Table 1. Items of questionnaire Construct

  5 Results and Discussion 5.1 The Influence of Women’s Trust in E-Hailing Applications on Their Intentions to Use the Applications The study indicates that women’s trust in e-hailing applications directly affects their intentions to use these applications. The structural model that was used in the study examined the relationships between different variables and found that trust in the applications was a significant predictor of women’s intentions to continue using them. In more detail, the study suggests that women who trust e-hailing applications are more likely to continue using them in the future. This trust may be related to factors such as the service’s reliability, the drivers’ safety, and the application’s ease of use. When women feel they can trust the application to provide a safe and reliable ride, they are more likely to use it again. It is important to note that trust is just a factor that influences women’s intentions to use e-hailing applications. There are other factors that were not covered in this study  
  K. A. Abdullah and M. Mahmod  
  such as pricing. The results of this study suggest that trust is an important factor in determining whether women will continue to use e-hailing applications over time. By building trust with their users, e-hailing applications can increase the likelihood that women will continue to use their services in the future. 5.2 The Influence of Women’s Trust in Drivers on Their Intentions to Use E-Hailing Applications This study showed women’s inclinations to use these apps are directly influenced by how much they trust the drivers of e-hailing services. The structural model employed in the research to analyse the correlations between various variables discovered that women’s intentions to continue using e-hailing services were significantly predicted by their confidence level in the drivers. Trust in drivers may be influenced by their skill level, dependability, and safety. Women are more likely to continue using the e-hailing service if they believe they have confidence in the driver to provide a secure and dependable journey. E-hailing apps may boost the possibility that women will continue using their services by establishing trust with their customers and ensuring that their drivers are capable, dependable, and safe in the future. 5.3 The Risks Affecting the Trust of Women Who Use E-Hailing Applications The effect of risk on the relationship between women’s trust in e-hailing applications and intent to use and women’s confidence in drivers of recall applications and intent to use was investigated. It was found that there is a significant effect of risk on the relationship between trust in e-hailing applications and women’s intention to use them. The study proved that the increase in risk affects the relationship between trust in e-hailing applications and the intention to use. Concerns related to information security, such as theft and unauthorised use of personally identifiable information, tracking, prosecution or harassment after information penetration, mitigate the intention to use e-hailing applications. This study is consistent with the results of previous studies, which proved that the privacy problem impacts the intention to use e-hailing applications [26–28]. Perplexingly, no risk influenced the relationship between confidence in e-hailing application drivers and women’s intention to use e-hailing applications. The current study did not provide any evidence regarding the risks women may face, such as kidnapping, rape, and harassment, that may affect the relationship between trust and intention to use. The study contributes to showing that trust in E-hailing applications affects women’s intentions to use E-hailing applications. The study hypotheses are supported by the use of risk as a moderator between the effect of trust in E-hailing applications and the intention to use E-hailing applications. Study findings indicate that trust in E-hailing drivers does not significantly impact customers’ intentions to use E-hailing applications. At first, study findings may seem surprising, but given that E-hailing applications connect strangers, it is likely that the application already considered most of the risks. Concerns related to information security such as theft and unauthorized use of personally identifiable information, tracking, prosecution, or harassment after information penetration mitigate the intention to use e-hailing applications. As a result, the study findings are consistent  
  The Application of UTAUT Theory to Determine Trust Among Women  
  Abstract. The housing department in Wisma Darul Aman plays an important role in planning, coordinating, and developing housing schemes for low-income Malaysians. However, the manual process of recording and storing applicant information on paper is time-consuming for the staff, and retrieving applicant information can be challenging. Thus, the main objective of this study is to design and develop the Housing Interview Management System (HIMS) for the housing department. The system manages applicant information, enabling storage, retrieval, modification, and deletion, while generating scores based on their responses, offering a more accurate and efficient solution for the Wisma Darul Aman housing department. To design and develop the system, Prototyping Software Development Methodology was used, which consists of identifying the requirements through interview sessions with housing department staff, designing the system, building the prototype using PHP and JavaScript, conducting user evaluation among housing department staff, refining prototype, and implementing and maintaining the system. The findings of the evaluation show that the system is useful and easy to use. Most respondents expressed high satisfaction with the system, indicating that the system worked as desired and effectively facilitated the housing interview process. The study highlights the significant potential of the HIMS to streamline the housing department’s interview process, contributing to improved affordable housing delivery for low-income Malaysians.

  by reducing paper use and minimizing data loss. This system will also save time and energy for administrative staff, increase their satisfaction, and be more environmentally friendly. Moreover, the system is designed to be user-friendly and easy to maintain. It enables staff to add, update, and retrieve applicants’ information quickly and efficiently. The system can also generate applicant information, and scores obtained more clearly and accurately. Furthermore, the system can detect whether an applicant has previously applied for a PPR house, which is believed to improve the quality of hires significantly [9]. Overall, this system is expected to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of housing programs, particularly in public housing authorities [8, 9]. 2.1 Tools for Housing Interview Management System Development The HIMS was developed using a combination of PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming languages, while XAMPP was utilized as the database management system. PHP and related technologies are popular in web-based development [4] and can be easily deployed on web servers. Additionally, Miro was employed during the initial stages of the system design to provide a visual representation of the system’s architecture and design. The stand-alone application using PHP and XAMPP allows for efficient storage and retrieval of applicant information, minimizing data loss and reducing errors in the manual process. This system is expected to improve efficiency and accuracy in the housing interview process, leading to increased satisfaction for the staff.  
  3 Methodology of the Study The software development life cycle (SDLC) was selected as the appropriate model for this project, as it encompasses the stages of the software development process and ensures the efficient implementation of high-quality software in meeting the specified requirements. Additionally, prototyping methodology, a software development approach where a prototype is built, tested, and refined until satisfactory [10], was employed to develop the HIMS due to its simplicity and ease of understanding. Figure 1 shows the phases of the prototyping model.  
  Fig. 1. Phases of prototyping methodology [10]  
  3.1 Requirements To develop the HIMS, it was essential to understand the concept, the individuals involved in the process, and the requirements. The requirements-gathering process involved examining the interview form utilized by the Housing Department during the interview process. The form was analyzed to comprehend the entire interview process, including the calculations involved and how the assessments were evaluated. 3.2 Quick Design A simple framework design was created to give users a high-level system overview. The design was created using an online software called Miro and was developed based on the project scope and requirements, including the appearance and features of the system. The framework includes various components, including interview questions, to store applicant information. This would enable the staff to understand the flow, conveniently digitize all the interview details into the corresponding fields, and effortlessly maintain or refer to the stored information. 3.3 Build Prototype The prototype is developed based on the data collected from the quick design and is a scale-down working model of the system. The project mainly focuses on developing a stand-alone application for the working environment using Visual Studio Code (VSC) and Xampp for data storage. The system development process incorporated all the requirements collected during the initial stage. 3.4 User Evaluation After the system was created, it was converted into an actual application and tested in the real world. The staff evaluated the HIMS based on the requirements, functionality, and performance. They shared their comments and ideas for further enhancement or implementation during the next round of system redesign. The strengths and weaknesses of the HIMS were identified through user evaluation. 3.5 Refine Prototype The refined prototype is where the current system development will be revised for the next redesigning or rebuilding prototype. After collecting the ideas and comments from the staff, the HIMS has been reconsidered to achieve the user’s requirements and the project scope. This evaluation and refined prototype were developed in loop mode until the staff was satisfied with this system. 3.6 Implement and Maintain After the final system was developed based on the prototype, it went through testing before sending to production. As the HIMS met all the requirements and satisfied the staff after the re-evaluation process, it is now complete and ready to be used during the interview session.

  2 Related Work It’s interesting to hear that consumer online shopping behavior is influenced by multiple factors such as attitude, psychology, product price, privacy, perceived benefit, and accessibility. Attitude towards online shopping has continued to be found to be an important predictor of online purchasing behavior. A recent study by [5] found that attitude towards online shopping significantly positively affected online purchase intention. A study by [6] indicated that how people feel about online shopping is related to how much they spend and how they plan to spend it. In the current situation where the pandemic has caused budget constraints, customers may be more willing to turn to cheaper products to save money. Additionally, one study from [7] suggested that transactional characteristics can be used to divide customers into different groups. By using this, we can know the behavior of each cluster. Three methods for grouping things were used: KMeans,

  KModes, and KMedoids. Psychological factors have also been found to be influential in online shopping behavior. According to a study by [8], several psychological elements can promote and affect consumers’ online shopping behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. Product price continues to be an important factor in online shopping behavior, and recent research has explored how price sensitivity differs across product categories. Consumers may buy more if they think your price is cheaper than competitors’. However, the response may be disappointing if the price is substantially greater than planned. According to [9], product prices are divided into three dimensions: fair price, fixed price, and relative price. In contrast, price strategy can be categorized as odd pricing, bundle pricing, and discount pricing strategy. Several studies have shown that the price of a product is more important and relevant to consumer purchasing behavior [10]. Moreover, perceived risk plays a big role in how consumers buy things online. According to [11] the decision to buy something via the internet is heavily influenced by how secure and confidential consumers believe their information to be. A recent investigation by [12] found that financial and privacy risks are some of the risks online shoppers face. The accessibility of online shopping platforms is also an important factor in online shopping behavior. A recent study by [13] determined that accessibility is an important factor for the reputation of online shopping malls. However, [14] stated that accessibility factors do not much impact the development of customer attitudes. Customers in India prefer face-to-face contacts with insurance agents due to a lack of accurate product information on websites. Perceived benefit, trust and security also as stated by [15] has positive relationship with online purchase behavior. An empirical study [16] found that trust and perceived benefits determine consumer attitudes toward online shopping, and factor analysis and structural path model analysis were used to test the hypothesized relationships of the research model. This finding shows that the better the perceived benefit, the higher the likelihood of online buying behavior among consumers. To sum up, the identified factors that influence online purchasing behavior play a significant role in shaping consumers’ decisions and actions in the online marketplace.  
  panel of experts of four people with strong backgrounds in marketing, e-commerce, and information systems from each faculty. The process of collecting data is around 3 months, from Feb 2023 until Mei 2023. The survey, a questionnaire, was divided into three main components. Section A covers the consumer’s demographics, Section B focuses on measuring the factors that affect how people buy things online. This study looked at eleven factors: attitude, perceived risk, trust and security, psychological, hedonic motivation, promotion, product price, privacy, emotional, perceived benefit, and accessibility. In Section C, respondents were asked how they bought things online. Additionally, we utilized modified scales from past research to develop scales for measuring various constructs. Table 1 illustrates the references from which the measurement scale has been adapted and modified as per the study. Sections B and C were measured using a five-point Likert scale (from strongly disagree to strongly agree).  
  4 Results and Discussion 4.1 Respondent Background The background characteristics of the respondents that have been highlighted include their gender, age, level of education, ethnicity, annual income, employment status, state, how often they use online shopping sites, how much they spend on average, and what kind of products they buy. A summary of the respondents’ profile is presented in Table 1. Table 1. Respondent’s Profile Demographic Information Gender Age  
  5 Conclusion This paper has presented the important variables that influence Malaysian consumers’ online purchase behavior. The grouping of factors has been identified as the major determinants of online purchasing behavior. When people shop online, these variables significantly influence their choices and actions. To improve the online shopping experience for Malaysian consumers, businesses must recognize and address these factors to create effective marketing strategies, optimize pricing strategies, address privacy concerns, highlight the advantages of their products, and improve accessibility. Businesses may more effectively meet the wants and preferences of Malaysian customers by considering these influencing elements, ultimately boosting their online sales. According to the findings, accessibility, attitude, perceived risk, psychological effects, product pricing, privacy, and perceived advantage all impact online purchasing behavior. Acknowledgement.

  development [1, 2]. In addition, it has ensured increased productivity, reduced poverty, and created employment opportunities for the rural population [1, 3, 4]. Besides, agricultural expansion in sub-Saharan Africa is hampered by agribusiness firms’ lack of new advanced technological capabilities, management and staff incompetence, and infrastructure and resources [3, 5, 6]. Other challenges include poor implementations of ICT services, which leads to the resistance of agribusiness partitioners in agricultural business industries. This indicates that companies do not prioritize the strategic implementation of ICT in their operations. On the other hand, ICT has played a crucial role in the progress and improvement of countries, especially when it is used effectively. The successful implementation of ICT in the agriculture industry in developed countries has led to significant advancements in the efficiency and productivity of the agriculture value chain. However, the adoption of ICT in the agriculture industry in sub-Saharan Africa was slow, and major transformations still need to occur [7]. Several studies have discovered that using ICT in agribusiness can enhance productivity, reduce costs, and improve the livelihoods of farmers and agribusiness practitioners. It also contributes to the overall operations of agribusiness activities and the value chain process. Nevertheless, adopting ICT services is not always straightforward, and various factors can influence an individual’s intentions to use these services [8]. A few agricultural businesses in Somalia have started utilizing technology to stay competitive and access global markets [9]. However, they face significant challenges, such as a lack of management and staff expertise, inadequate infrastructure and resources, and the absence of innovative technologies. These obstacles may impede the adoption and effectively using new technologies, lower productivity, and hamper overall progress. Hence, this study analyzes the relationship between PU and PEOU on intention to use ICT services and how these factors influence ICT services adoption among agribusiness practitioners in Somalia. In addition, this research strengthens the literature on ICT service adoption regarding agribusiness. Furthermore, it provides insights into factors that may enhance the adoption and use of ICT services in Somalia’s agribusiness sector. This study employs TAM theory to explain ICT services’ adoption by agribusiness practitioners in Somalia. Here, the results inform strategies and policies that can improve the adoption and use of ICT services in the agribusiness sector, improve productivity, and promote overall progress in Somalia. The remaining sections of the paper will follow a specific structure. First, there will be an overview of the literature review. Subsequently, the research framework and hypothesis development will be discussed. The research setting will then be introduced, followed by an examination of the methodology applied in this study. Consequently, the data analysis will be presented, and the study’s findings will be explained. Finally, the paper will conclude by summarizing the primary research points.  
  2 Literature Review 2.1 ICT in Agriculture Literature on using ICTs in agriculture suggests that ICTs can enhance efficiency, productivity, and competitiveness in the agricultural sector. For example, ICTs Services have been employed in agriculture with precision farming. This method utilizes drones,  
  sensors, and Global Positioning System (GPS) technology to enhance crop yields and decrease expenses [10]. According to Ayim et al. [7] study, various obstacles impede the adoption of ICT in African agribusiness, such as inadequate policies, limited expertise, and insufficient technological infrastructure. Another study indicated that personal ICT gadgets such as phones, radios, and televisions could improve climate-smart agriculture adoption by providing farmers with timely information and forecasts. This access to information can significantly enhance farmers’ welfare and facilitate the uptake of other agricultural innovations, such as biological control. Furthermore, this study emphasizes the importance of providing farmers with ICT tools to enhance their decision-making abilities and promote sustainable agriculture. Therefore, policymakers and agricultural practitioners should prioritize adopting ICT tools to improve farm productivity and sustainability [11]. Additionally, it is found that ICT use in small agribusinesses in Nigeria’s native communities. The researchers have established that social factors are crucial in these communities and that a balance between designing ICT solutions and addressing social elements is necessary to increase the acceptance of ICT advancements, such as Internet access, computers, and online portals [12] Lokeswari [13] has determined that adopting ICT services among agricultural staff is influenced by various factors such as infrastructure, education, content availability, affordability, and PU. Despite awareness of the benefits of ICT, the lack of infrastructure and technical knowledge is a significant barrier to adoption. Hence, efforts should be made to improve ICT infrastructure, provide relevant training and education, and develop affordable and accessible ICT solutions to increase adoption and use among rural farmers [13]. 2.2 ICT Services in Agribusiness Several factors, including access to technology, education level, business size, and existing technology usage influence the adoption of ICT in small-scale agribusiness enterprises in Somalia. Additionally, limited knowledge and skills and inadequate infrastructure were identified as significant barriers to adopting ICT. In addition, government policies and regulations may have a substantial role in enhancing ICT adoption and supporting the growth of small-scale agribusiness enterprises in Somalia [9]. Nevertheless, other research has shown that ICT can drive sustainable agribusiness innovation [14]. For example, precision agriculture technologies, such as precision planting and fertilization, can improve crop yields while reducing the use of resources and minimizing the environmental impact [15]. Similarly, using ICT in supply chain management can improve the traceability and transparency of food products, leading to more efficient and sustainable production and distribution processes [16]. Furthermore, food sustainability transitions are enhanced using information and communication technologies (ICTs), improving resource productivity, reducing inefficiencies, lowering management costs, and improving chain coordination across agro-food value chains [16]. Conversely, ICT services refer to the many services offered through information and communication technology. (ICT). It covers various topics, such as telecommunications, software, hardware, the internet, cloud computing, IT support, e-commerce, and many more [17]. Additionally, these ICT services have played an essential role in facilitating
