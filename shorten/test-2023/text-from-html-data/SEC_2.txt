  SEC 2023 – Trustworthy Edge Computing Workshop  
  Organized in conjunction with ACM SEC 2023, Wilmington, DE, USA, Dec. 9th 2023  
  Edge computing has become a topic of significant interest in academic and industrial research, driven by the fundamental improvements in latency, bandwidth savings and energy efficiency it offers with respect to offloading application workloads. While many envisioned applications in edge computing are relevant in the context of real-time analytics and feedback, most of the research today approaches edge computing from a “best effort” perspective, focusing on expected/average system behavior.
