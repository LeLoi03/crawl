  The approach will be both theoretical and practical, through invited talks, tutorials, workshops, posters, presentation of demos and functional prototypes. Besides, we offer the possibility to carry out a limited number of virtual presentations for those who want to participate but have serious difficulties to travel. The proceedings will include all the presented communications to the conference. As in previous editions of IWANN, we are arranging the publication of the proceedings with Springer-Verlag as Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series, and the books will be available shortly after the Congress in order to allow the authors to incorporate suggestions and improvements from the presentations. It is also foreseen the publication of extended versions of selected papers in special issues of several prestigious journals. Previous congresses led to special issues of Neural Computing and Applications, PLoS One and Neural Processing Letters. We are working to have at least the same collaborations.  
 We hope to see you in A Coru√±a next June. Do not miss on the deadline  !!
