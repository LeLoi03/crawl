 Time zone: Anywhere on Earth(AoE)    
  Full paper abstracts due: January 24, 2023  
  Full papers due: January 31, 2023  
  Full paper notifications: April 4, 2023  
  Camera ready papers: April 26, 2023  
 Publication date:  accepted papers will be published open access for one month on the ACM Digital Library up to two weeks prior to the conference opening date (exact date TBA)  
 Full paper authors are required to submit an abstract by midnight January 24, 2023 AoE. Paper submission (deadline: midnight January 31, 2023 AoE) is not possible without a submitted abstract. We recommend authors waiting for notification from the other conferences to submit an abstract, even if they do not ultimately submit a paper. Immediately after the abstract deadline, PC Chairs will desk reject submissions that lack informative titles and abstracts (“placeholder abstracts”).  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 Submission Guidelines  
 See this brief checklist to strengthen an IR paper   , for authors and reviewers.  
 Full research papers must describe original work that has not been previously published, not accepted for publication elsewhere, and not simultaneously submitted or currently under review in another journal or conference (including the other tracks of SIGIR 2023).  
 Submissions of full research papers must be in English, in PDF format, and be at most 9 pages (including figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any content except references) in length, with unrestricted space for references, in the current ACM two-column conference format. Suitable LaTeX, Word, and Overleaf   templates are available from the ACM Website   (use “sigconf” proceedings template for LaTeX and the Interim Template for Word). ACM’s CCS concepts and keywords are not required for review but may be required if accepted and published by the ACM.  
 For LaTeX, the following should be used:  
 documentclass[sigconf,natbib=true,anonymous=true]{acmart}  Submissions must be anonymous and should be submitted electronically via EasyChair:  
  At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for, and present the work at the conference.  
 Anonymity  
 The full paper review process is double-blind. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submission must not include author information and must not include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent. However, it is acceptable to refer to companies or organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments or deployed solutions if there is no implication that the authors are currently affiliated with these organizations. While authors can upload to institutional or other preprint repositories such as arXiv.org before reviewing is complete, we generally discourage this since it places anonymity at risk. If the paper is already on arXiv, please change the title and abstract so that it is not immediately obvious they are the same. Do not upload the paper to a preprint site after submission to SIGIR—wait until a review decision to avoid reviewers seeing the paper in daily digests or other places. Breaking anonymity puts the submission at risk of being desk rejected.  
 Authors should carefully go through ACM’s authorship policy   before submitting a paper. Please ensure that all authors are clearly identified in EasyChair before the submission deadline. To support the identification of reviewers with conflicts of interest, the full author list must be specified at submission time. No changes to authorship   will be permitted for the camera-ready submission under any circumstance or after submissions close. So please, make sure you have them listed correctly when submissions close.  
 Desk Rejection Policy  
 Submissions that violate the preprint policy, anonymity, length, or formatting requirements, or are determined to violate ACM’s policies on academic dishonesty   , including plagiarism, author misrepresentation, falsification, etc., are subject to desk rejection by the chairs. Any of the following may result in desk rejection:  
 Figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgements, or any other content after page 9 of the submission. 
  Formatting not in line with the guidelines provided above. 
  Authors or authors’ institutional affiliations clearly named or easily discoverable. 
  Links to source code repositories that reveal author identities, or extended versions of the current paper. It is recommended to hold these for the final published version and | submit source code for artifact review | . 
  Addition of authors after abstract submission. 
  Content that has been determined to have been copied from other sources. 
  Any form of academic fraud or dishonesty. 
  Lack of topical fit for SIGIR. 
 Relevant Topics  
 Filtering and recommendation (e.g., content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, recommender systems, recommendation algorithms, zero-query and implicit search, personalized recommendation). 
  Document representation and content analysis for search or recommendation (e.g., cross-lingual and multilingual search, NLP: summarization, text representation, linguistic analysis, readability, opinion mining and sentiment analysis, clustering, classification, topic models for search and recommendation). 
  Knowledge acquisition (e.g. information extraction, relation extraction, event extraction, query understanding, human-in-the-loop knowledge acquisition). 
  Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing for Search and Recommendation.  Research bridging ML, NLP, and IR.  
 Core ML (e.g. deep learning for IR, embeddings, intelligent personal assistants and agents, unbiased learning).
