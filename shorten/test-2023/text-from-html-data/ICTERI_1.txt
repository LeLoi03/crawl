 MROL 2023 at a Glance   
 This Workshop is designed to consider the state of the art and potential benefit of new and emerging adaptive technologies application within the open systems of higher education. The aim is to explore the use of open education and research methods, resources and technologies for forming the creative and ICT competent person in view of European Research Area development. That have to meet the priorities of open education, open science, open communication and open data access and delivery, the wide use of cloud-based learning tools, platforms and infrastructures to support learning and research. Workshop topics are related to big data, smart data, data and resources of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), adaptive data processing and analytics, smart learning and research environments to provide effective technologies for data access and processing within the open pedagogical systems of higher education.  
 The Workshop aims at:  
 Workshop Language: English   
 No Fees   
 The Workshop does not charge any conference fee. Participation is FREE; ICTERI 2023 sponsors cover expenses.  
 ICTERI 2023 will run in a hybrid mode  , which combines physical assembly and virtual participation for those colleagues, who are unable to attend physically due to valid reasons.  
 The Scope of MROL   
 Nowadays, an effective and promising approach to open pedagogical systems design is the use of the cloud computing technologies to provide ICT support for the functioning and development of the computer-based educational and research environment. Innovative technological solutions for learning environment organization and design using cloud computing (CC) and ICT outsourcing show promise and usefulness. The challenges of making the ICT infrastructure of the university environment fit the needs of its users, taking maximum advantage of modern network technologies, and ensuring the best pedagogical outcomes leads to the search for the most reasonable ways of its modernization.
