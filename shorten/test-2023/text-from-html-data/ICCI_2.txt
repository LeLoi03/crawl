 Abstract  
 IEEE ICCI*CC'23: Stanford University, August 19-21, 2023. Themes: Fundamental Challenges to Basic Research on the Theories and Methodologies of AI and Cognitive/Intelligent Computing. • What is the next generation of intelligent computers underpinned by discoveries in intelligence science: General cognitive computers vs. pretrained AI systems? [Ref. 1: The Odyssey to Cognitive Computers.] • May the classic preprogrammed (von Neumann) computers deal with infinitive and unpredictable real-world problems at run-time? [Ref. 2: Cognitive Computing and Autonomous AI (AAI).] • Will the pretrained AI systems (such as Chat-GPT) be able to exhaustively cover the entire state space of machine reasoning beyond the coverage of their training models: Enumerational knowledge (empirical) vs. human knowledge (Induction/deduction-based)? [Ref. 3: What can’t Chat-GPT do?] • Will intelligence science enable AI systems to learn human inference mechanisms rather than let them to collect infinitive factors and unstructured knowledge by so called large-language models? How are the essential forms of human intelligence and wisdom generated beyond big data and empirical learning? [Ref. 4: Intelligent Mathematics.]

 It is recognized that the kernels of human knowledge and theories of abstract sciences have been archived in mathematical forms with indispensable generality and abstractedness. Intelligent Mathematics (IM) is contemporary mathematics for manipulating complex mathematical entities in the brain and intelligence systems known as hyperstructures (H) for formalizing rigorous expressions, inferences, and computational intelligence generation. H are nonnumerical abstract entities beyond those of real numbers (R) and bits (B). Therefore, IM becomes highly demanded across modern Abstract Sciences as counterparts of classic entity-oriented Concrete Sciences. IM is particularly demanded in Intelligent Science underpinning classic AI, autonomous AI (AAI) and contemporary Cognitive Computers (kC). In other words, IS may only be advanced based on IM rather than pretrained AI or preprogrammed technologies, because the inherent limitations of classic approaches may not be able to solve the fundamental challenges towards autonomous intelligence generation by kC. A pinnacle of IM is the recent proofs of the world top-ten hardest problems known as the Goldbach conjecture and the Twin-Prime conjecture by the author. IM has led to unprecedented theories and general methodologies for implementing kC towards autonomous intelligence generation by autonomous inference machines.

 The emergence of abstract sciences as a counterpart of classic concrete sciences is presented in this work. The framework of abstract sciences encompasses data, information, knowledge, and intelligence sciences from the bottom up. It is found that intelligence is the ultimate level of cognitive objects generated in human brains aggregated from data (sensory), information (cognition), and knowledge (comprehension). However, there is a lack of rigorous studies and coherent theories towards the theoretical framework of abstract sciences as the counterpart of classical concrete sciences. This paper explores the cognitive and mathematical models of abstract mental objects in the brain. The taxonomy and cognitive foundations of them are explored. A set of mathematical models of data, information, knowledge, and intelligence is formally created in intelligent mathematics. Based on the cognitive and mathematical models of the cognitive objects, formal properties and relationship of contemporary data, information, knowledge, and intelligence sciences are rigorously explained.

 A Cognitive Computing Methodology for Software Requirement Elicitation and Formal Specification

 Autonomous software requirement analysis and specifications is not only an ultimate goal of cognitive computing, but also a persistent challenge to theories and technologies of software engineering. A cognitive computing model is demanded to autonomously elicit and rigorously refine software requirements in order to generate a set of formal specifications. This paper presents a novel methodology for the design of a cognitive computing method for Software Requirement Elicitation and Specifications (SRES) based on the latest advances in software science and intelligent mathematics. SRES is implemented as an interactive system for capturing software requirements and generating formal specifications. The SRES methodology and experiments are demonstrated for solving real-world and complex software engineering problems enabled by cognitive computing theories underpinned by intelligent mathematics.

 On the Goldbach Theorem: A Formal Proof of Goldbach Conjecture by the Theory of Mirror Prime Decomposition (Keynote)    
 Conference Paper    
 Full-text available    
 Dec 2022 
 Yingxu Wang 
 This keynote lecture presents the proof of Goldbach Conjecture based on the author's recent discoveries: a) The universality and infinity properties of the set of Mirror Primes (Pu) adjacent to arbitrary even numbers; and b) The recursive property of Pu, P, and N beyond classical discrete or random treatments. They lead to the establishment of the Theorem of Mirror Prime Decompositions (MPD) as a necessary counterpart of the axiom of Euclidean Prime Factorization. The MPD theorem enables a formal proof of the Goldbach conjecture to be a rigorous theorem in number theory. The philosophy of this work are underpinned by the basic research initiative on Intelligent Mathematics (IM), which provides a set of unprecedented mathematical means for rigorously modeling and manipulating nontraditional abstract entities in contemporary sciences such as AI and computational intelligence in data science, knowledge science, and intelligence science for enabling machine knowledge learning, autonomous intelligence generation, and symbiotic human-machine societies.

 Towards the Pinnacle of Cognitive AI (CAI) beyond Pretrained and Preprogramed Technologies (Keynote)   
 July 2022    
 Yingxu Wang 
  The theoretical bottlenecks and technical challenges towards fully intelligent and autonomous AI are fundamentally rooted in current technologies of pretrained AI and preprogramed computing. Basic studies in contemporary Intelligence Science have revealed that the natural intelligence of the brain is not directly generated by data nor implemented by predetermined behaviors. This leads to ... [Show full abstract]  contemporary transdisciplinary investigations into the nature of general intelligence shared by human and machines, their theoretical foundations, and novel mathematical means for expressing and manipulating the unprecedented intelligent entities across the real and abstract worlds. It is discovered that human and machine intelligence is dually aggregated from (sensory | data), (neural signaling | information), (semantic networks | knowledge), and (autonomous behaviors | intelligence) in a recursive framework, where the former are embodied in neural structures of the brain, while the latter are represented in abstract (mathematical) forms in autonomous AI. Therefore, natural intelligence (NI) and AI are equivalent counterparts in philosophy and mathematics sharing a unified theoretical foundation of intelligence science represented by the Hierarchical Intelligence Model (HIM), which are compatible to those of human brain as revealed by the Layered Reference Model of the Brain. The unified theoretical framework of intelligence science based on HIM and LRMB has triggered Cognitive AI (CAI) and symbiotic human-machine intelligence underpinned by Intelligent Mathematics (IM). IM has shed light to the solving of challenging NI/AI problems by a rigorous and generic methodology. A pinnacle of IM is the recent proofs of the world top-ten hardest problems: the Goldbach conjecture and the Twin-Prime conjecture. Paradigms of IM encompass inference algebra, concept algebra, semantic algebra, real-time process algebra (RTPA), system algebra, causal probability algebra, big data algebra, image frame algebra, relation algebra, etc. IM leads to unprecedented theories and methodologies for implementing cognitive computers and cognitive robots towards a symbiotic NI and AI coherently sharable by human brain and intelligent machines in order to achieving the ultimate aims of intelligence science and autonomous computing.
