 Program     
 Welcome to the 14th International Conference on Computational Creativity, ICCC’23!   
 Computational creativity is the art, science, philosophy, and engineering of computational systems which, by taking on particular responsibilities, exhibit behaviors that unbiased observers would deem to be creative. As a field of research, this area is thriving, with progress in formalizing what it means for software to be creative, along with many exciting and valuable applications of creative software in the sciences, the arts, literature, gaming, and elsewhere.  
 ICCC’23 will take place June 19 – June 23, 2023, at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada.
