 ICCS 2023 – Prague, Czechia  
 “Computation at the Cutting Edge of Science”  
 The International Conference on Computational Science  is an annual conference that brings together researchers and scientists from mathematics and computer science as basic computing disciplines, as well as from other various application areas, who are pioneering computational methods in sciences such as physics, chemistry, life sciences, and engineering, as well as in arts and humanitarian fields, to discuss problems and solutions in the area, identify new issues, and shape future directions for research.  
 ICCS 2023 in Prague, Czechia, will be the twenty-third edition in this series of highly successful conferences.  
  Standing on the Vltava river, Prague is a political, cultural , and economic hub of central Europe.  
 Out of the submitted full papers to the main track and thematic tracks, we will select some 30% high-quality papers for presentation at the conference and publication in the proceedings. These are published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series  and indexed by Scopus, EI Engineering Index, Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation Index (included in ISI Web of Science), and several other indexing services  . The papers will contain linked references, XML versions and citable DOI numbers.  
 As the conference theme this year is “Computation at the Cutting Edge of Science”  , papers highlighting the role of Computational Science in assisting multidisciplinary research will be particularly welcomed.  
 This conference will be a unique event focusing on recent developments in: scalable scientific algorithms; advanced software tools; computational grids; advanced numerical methods; and novel application areas. These innovative novel models, algorithms and tools drive new science through efficient application in areas such as physical systems, computational and systems biology, environmental systems, finance, and others.  
 ICCS is committed to enhancing diversity and inclusion in the conference, without regard to race, age, religion, ethnicity, nationality, ability, gender identity, sexual orientation, or gender expression.  
 ICCS is an A-rank   conference in the CORE classification.  
 We look forward to welcoming you to this exciting event in Prague!
