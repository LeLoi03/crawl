 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Cyber Security (IEEE CICS)  
 Computational Intelligence constitutes an umbrella of techniques, has proven to be flexible in solving dynamic and complex real-world problems. These techniques typically include Machine Learning, Fuzzy Logic, Evolutionary Computation, Intelligent Agent Systems, Neural Networks, Cellular Automata, Artificial Immune Systems, Game Theory and other similar computational models. These techniques are widely used in different cyber security applications such as online behavior monitoring, e-fraud detection, robust decision support modules to enhance the protection of computing devices and information infrastructure at different levels.
