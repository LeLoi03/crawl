 INVITATION TO ATTEND    
 We invite you to join us for the 2023 Australasian Computer Science Week (ASCW).  
 Monash University, Caulfield Campus, Melbourne, 31 January – 3 February 2023   
 ACSW is the premier event for Computer Science researchers across Australasia, organised under the governing auspices of Computing Research and Education (CORE) Association of Australasia.  
 2023 will be the first opportunity for our communities to come together in the one location since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As such the conference is planned to be a physical event, and we encourage authors to travel to Melbourne to deliver their talk, and network with delegates in-person.  
 More information regarding invited speakers and programmed events will be released via the website as planning proceeds. We encourage you to check the website regularly for updates.  
 Early registration closes 13 January.   
 We look forward to seeing you in Melbourne.
