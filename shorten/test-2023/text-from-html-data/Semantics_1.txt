  21/Sep   
 International representatives from business and research organisations will gather this September, in Leipzig (Germany) for the 19th edition of SEMANTiCS and Language Intelligence 2023 conference, to exchange ideas on data and information management, artificial intelligence, and  
  digital transformation. Donâ€™t miss out on this exceptional opportunity to be part of SEMANTiCS / Language Intelligence 2023, where the worlds of Knowledge Graphs, Multilingual Artificial Intelligence, and semantic technologies converge.  
  At SEMANTiCS researchers, industry experts and business leaders can develop a thorough understanding of trends and application scenarios in the fields of Machine Learning, Data Science, Linked Data and Natural Language Processing. Indeed, this edition will focus on the use of  
  knowledge graphs and artificial intelligence in semantic technologies. SEMANTiCS is organised in conjunction with LANGUAGE INTELLIGENCE 2023, which will showcase the latest developments in Multilingual Artificial Intelligence: speech interaction, deep meaning processing and multilingual communication and cognition. Both conferences will take place from September 20-22, 2023, at the Hyperion Hotel in Leipzig (Germany).  
  SEMANTiCS has a longstanding reputation for bridging the gap between academic research and practical industry applications, creating an environment where ideas flourish, and knowledge is shared. By changing venues between Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands, SEMANTiCS ensures the Semantic Web community across Europe can unite, collaborate, and shape the future of semantic technologies. Besides, the organising committee comprises a diverse pool of members from different countries: Germany, the USA, Italy, Spain, the UK, Austria, and the Netherlands.
