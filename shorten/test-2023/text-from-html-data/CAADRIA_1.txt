  The Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA) promotes teaching and research in CAAD in Asia, and has members on six continents.  
 CAADRIA was founded with the following objectives:  
 To facilitate the dissemination of information about CAAD among Asian schools of architecture, planning, engineering, and building sciences. 
  To encourage the exchange of staff, students, experience, courseware, and software among schools. 
  To identify research and develop needs in CAAD education and to initiate collaboration to satisfy them. 
  To promote research and teaching in CAAD that enhances creativity rather than production. 
  CAADRIA is one of the four founding organizations of the International Journal of Architectural Computing (IJAC), and supervises one issue each year. IJAC is published by Multi-Science in both paper and electronic versions.
