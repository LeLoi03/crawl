 19th International Conference on  
 Trust, Privacy & Security in Digital Business (TrustBus 2022)  
  on Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA 2022)   
 Recent computing paradigms, such as cloud computing, big data and the Internet of Things open new horizons to businesses, improving effectiveness and ensuring that businesses remain competitive in the global marketplace. These developments have occurred in a remarkably short time span, with technologies sometimes advancing too fast for society and governments to keep pace, and leading to resulting, concerns around trust and the extent to which information security and user privacy can be ensured.  
 Topics  
 In answer to these concerns, the 19th International Conference on Trust, Privacy and Security in Digital Business (TrustBus 2022) will provide an international forum for researchers and practitioners to exchange information regarding advancements in the state of the art and practice of trust, privacy and security in digital business. We are interested in papers, work-in-progress reports, and industrial experiences describing advances in all areas of digital business applications related to trust, privacy and security, including, but not limited to:  
 Accountability, Transparency and Intervenability 
  Anonymity and pseudonymity
