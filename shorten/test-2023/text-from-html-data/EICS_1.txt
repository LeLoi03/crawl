EICS   
 The ACM SIGCHI Symposium on  
 Engineering Interactive Computing Systems  
 EICS is an international conference devoted to all aspects of engineering usable and effective interactive computing systems, ranging from traditional workstation-based interactive systems to those involving new and emerging modalities (e.g., gesture), applications (e.g., mobile and ubiquitous games) and development methods (e.g., extreme programming).  
 EICS focuses on tools, techniques and methods for designing and developing interactive systems. EICS brings together people who study or practice the engineering of interactive systems, drawing from the HCI, Software Engineering, Requirements Engineering, CSCW, Ubiquitous & Pervasive Systems, and Game Development communities.  
 EICS papers are published in the ACM journal Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction - EICS track  (or PACMHCI-EICS). More information on PACMHCI-EICS can be found here  .
