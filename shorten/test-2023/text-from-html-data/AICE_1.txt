 AiCE began over 20 years ago as an organisation that sought to bring a broader focus to computing. Members included engineers, scientists, medical specialists and others who used information and communications technology (ICT) frequently in their professional lives, but would not qualify for membership of a professional ICT society. The conference series [1]   in recent years has focused increasingly on cybersecurity and ethics, whilst still being broad, inviting contributions on a wide variety of ICT ethics.
