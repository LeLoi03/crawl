 Object-oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications (OOPSLA)  
  OOPSLA (Object-oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications) is now part of SPLASH (Systems, Programming Languages, and Applications: Software for Humanity).  
 The SPLASH Steering Committee  serves as the OOPSLA Steering Committee.  
 The scope of OOPSLA includes all aspects of programming languages and software engineering, broadly construed. Papers that address any aspect of software development are welcome, including requirements, modeling, prototyping, design, implementation, generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance, reuse, replacement, and retirement of software systems. Papers may address these topics in a variety of ways, including new tools (such as languages, program analyses, and runtime systems), new techniques (such as methodologies, design processes, code organization approaches, and management techniques), and new evaluations (such as formalisms and proofs, corpora analyses, user studies, and surveys).  
 Most Influential OOPSLA Paper Award  Each year a “Most Influential” OOPSLA paper is chosen and an presentation is made at OOPSLA. More details about this award and past winning papers can be found here  . SIGPLAN also makes several other awards including an “Outstanding Dissertation Award.” Please consider making a nomination for one of these awards. More details about the SIGPLAN awards can be found here  .
