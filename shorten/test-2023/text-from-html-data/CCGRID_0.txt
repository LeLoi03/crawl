  IEEE/ACM CCGRID 2023 
 IEEE/ACM CCGRID 2023  
 The 23rd IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing  
  In conjunction with the 7th IEEE International Conference on Fog and Edge Computing (ICFEC 2023)  
 May 1–4, 2023    
  Bangalore, India   
 The 23rd IEEE/ACM international Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing (CCGrid 2023) is a leading forum to disseminate and discuss research activities and results on a broad range of topics in distributed systems, ranging from computing clusters to widely distributed Clouds and emerging Internet computing paradigms such as Fog and Edge Computing to support Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data applications. The conference will feature keynotes, technical presentations, posters, workshops, tutorials, as well as the SCALE challenge featuring live demonstrations and the ICFEC 2023 conference. The conference places special emphasis on all aspects of equity, diversity and inclusion in systems research. The conference will be held as an in-person event.  
 TOPICS OF INTEREST   
 The conference covers diverse aspects of distributed systems and applications in the context of Cluster, Cloud, and Internet computing environments. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:  
 HARDWARE SYSTEMS AND NETWORKING | Storage and I/O Systems; Sustainable and Green Computing; and Architecture, Networking and Data Centers for Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing. 
  SOFTWARE SYSTEMS AND PLATFORMS | Programming Models and Runtime Systems; Resource Management and Scheduling; Performance Modeling and Evaluation; and Energy-efficient software/applications for Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing. 
  APPLICATIONS AND TRANSLATION | AI/ML, Cyber-Physical Systems, e-Health, IoT, Digital Twins, Autonomous systems, Cyber-Security, Privacy, and Enterprise applications for Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing; Applications for Cloud-to-Things continuum. 
  CALL FOR RESEARCH PAPERS:  [CLOSED]  
 CALL FOR POSTERS:  The research poster session offers a chance to present early research ideas, late-breaking results, and novel perspectives on Cluster, Cloud and Internet computing at the CCGrid conference. We welcome submissions from academia, industry and labs to submit posters in the topics of interest to CCGRID. The authors are invited to submit two-page extended abstracts for the poster, excluding references, using the IEEE 2-column format for conference proceedings.  
 CALL FOR EARLY CAREER & STUDENT SHOWCASE POSTERS:  Early Career and Students' Showcase of CCGrid 2023 provides a forum for students and early career researchers a chance to have discussions, solicit feedback on their research, and gain mentorship on their careers from experts attending the conference. We invite poster submissions to this showcase on novel research ideas, work-in-progress, or a summary of the dissertation work conducted in the topics of interest to CCGRID. The first author of the submission must be a student enrolled in a Doctoral or Masters degree program at an academic institution, a postdoctoral researcher, or an early career researcher having a Masters' or Doctoral degree within the last five years. The authors are invited to submit two-page extended abstracts for the poster, excluding references, using the IEEE two-column format for conference proceedings.  
 CALL FOR SCALE CHALLENGE SUBMISSIONS:  IEEE TCSC International Scalable Computing Challenge (SCALE 2023) is sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Scalable Computing (TCSC). The objective of the SCALE Challenge is to highlight and showcase real-world problem-solving using computing that scales. Participants in the challenge will be expected to identify significant current real-world problems where scalable computing techniques can be effectively used, and design, implement, evaluate and demonstrate solutions. Problems that have a social impact are of particular interest. Authors are invited to submit six-page technical paper, excluding references, describing the nature of the problem being solved, the solution technique, and offer preliminary evidence of the scalability achieved.  
 PROCEEDINGS:  All accepted posters, SCALE challenge papers and workshop papers will be published as a companion proceeding (CCGRIDW) through the IEEE CS Conference Publication Services and available online at IEEE Xplore digital library.
