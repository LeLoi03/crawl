 IDA aims at being an accessible symposium by keeping the registration fees low. Moreover, it traditionally encourages students to participate in the symposium and therefore offers special students rates.

 Note: the early registration deadline has been extended from March 18 to March 25!   
 Registration is only possible through this website.  
  Registration is non-refundable under any circumstances.
