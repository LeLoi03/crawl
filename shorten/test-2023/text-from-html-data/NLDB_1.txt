 The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has recently experienced several exciting developments. In research, these developments have been reflected in the emergence of neural language models (Deep Learning, Word Embeddings, Transformers) and the importance of aspects such as transparency, bias and fairness, a (renewed) interest in various linguistic phenomena, such as in discourse and argumentation mining, and in new problems such as the detection of disinformation and hate speech in social media, as well of mental health disorders that increased during the recent pandemic. Regarding applications, NLP systems have evolved to the point that they now offer real-life, tangible benefits to enterprises. Many of these NLP systems are now considered a de-facto offering in business intelligence suites, such as algorithms for recommender systems and opinion mining/sentiment analysis.  
 It is against this backdrop of recent innovations in NLP and its applications in information systems that the 28th edition of the NLDB conference takes place. We welcome research and industrial contributions, describing novel, previously unpublished works on NLP and its applications across a plethora of topics as described in the Call for Papers.  
 Call for Papers NLDB 2023 invites authors to submit papers for oral or poster presentations on unpublished research that addresses theoretical aspects, algorithms, applications, architectures for applied and integrated NLP, resources for applied NLP, and other aspects of NLP, as well as survey and discussion papers.  
 Authors should follow the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) format and submit their manuscripts as a PDF via Easychair.  
 Important Dates Full paper submission: 14 March 2023 Paper notification: 10 April 2023 Camera-ready deadline: 24 April 2023 Conference: 21 - 23 June 2023
