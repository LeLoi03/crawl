 The IEEE World Congress on Services (SERVICES), a hybrid event, is the premier international forum for sharing and discussing the latest advancements and emerging trends related to services computing technologies. IEEE SERVICES 2023 is built around the six technical conferences listed below, focusing on cloud computing (CLOUD), edge computing & communications (EDGE), digital health (ICDH), web-based services (ICWS), quantum software (QSW), and software services engineering (SSE). Moreover, it will feature two diversity & inclusion (D&I) symposia on women in services computing (WISC) and young experts on services computing (YESC), respectively. Finally, it will feature two special cross-conference symposia with renowned speakers and invited paper presentations, the IEEE John Vincent Atanasoff Symposium on Modern Computing and the IEEE Cark K. Chang Symposium on Software Services Engineering.
