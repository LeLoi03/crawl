 International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management (EKAW)*  
 Monthly Featured   
 The biennial International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management (EKAW)  , formerly the European Knowledge Acquisition Workshop (EKAW) series 1)  , is concerned with all aspects of eliciting, acquiring, modeling and managing knowledge, and its role in the construction of knowledge-intensive systems and services for the semantic web, knowledge management, e-business, natural language processing, intelligent information integration, etc.  
 EKWA is held alternately with K-CAP  – the International Conference on Knowledge Capture.  
 Of Special “Knowledge Management” interest:
