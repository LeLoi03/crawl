 About 
  Accepted Papers 
  Call for Papers 
  Formal techniques can help analyse programs, precisely describe program behaviour, and verify program properties. Modern programming languages are interesting targets for formal techniques due to their ubiquity and wide user base, stable and well-defined interfaces and platforms, and powerful (but also complex) libraries. New languages and applications in this space are continually arising, resulting in new programming languages (PL) research challenges.  
 The workshop has a broad PL theme. The most important criterion is that submissions will generate interesting discussions within this community. The term “Java-like” is somewhat historic and should be interpreted broadly: FTfJP solicits and welcomes submissions relating to programming languages in general, beyond Java, including submissions related to C#, Scala, and similar languages, and submissions on more general topics that may be relevant to such languages.  
 Example topics of interest include:  
 Language design and semantics 
  Security 
  Pearls (programs or proofs) 
  FTfJP welcomes submissions on technical contributions, case studies, experience reports, challenge proposals, and position papers.

 Both types of contributions will benefit from feedback received at the workshop. Submissions will be peer reviewed, and will be evaluated based on their clarity and their potential to generate interesting discussions. Reviewing will be single blind, there is no need to anonymize submissions.  
 The format of the workshop encourages interaction. FTfJP is a forum in which a wide range of people share their expertise, from experienced researchers to beginning PhD students.  
 All questions about submissions should be emailed to Aaron Tomb aarontomb@gmail.com
