 The Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC)  brings together leading researchers and practitioners, along with a diverse group of security professionals drawn from academia, industry, and government, gathered to present and discuss the latest cybersecurity results and topics. With peer reviewed technical papers, invited talks, panels, national interest discussions, and workshops, ACSAC continues its core mission of investigating practical solutions for computer and network security technologies.  
 As an internationally recognized forum where researchers, practitioners, and developers meet to learn and to exchange practical ideas and experiences in computer and network security, we invite you to submit your work. In addition to peer-reviewed papers on novel applied research, we also welcome case studies on real-world applications, panels featuring world experts, and workshops consisting of 1-2 day sessions on hot cybersecurity and privacy topics.
