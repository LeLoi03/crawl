  SUBMISSION   
 ABOUT SETTA   
 Formal methods emerged as a disciple area in computer science and software engineering half a century ago. An international community is formed researching, developing and teaching formal theories, techniques and tools for software modeling, specification, design and verification.  
 However, the impact of the theories, techniques and tools on the improvement of qualities of the daily used software systems is far from being convincing to software engineering practitioners. The gap between the development of formal methods and the advances in software technologies is not being seen becoming narrower. More precisely, the relation between formal methods and software technologies is not clearly understood.  
  presentations from PhD students on their research. 
 The purpose of the symposium  is to bring international researchers to exchange research results and ideas with the Chinese computer science and software engineering community. It is the hope to develop understanding of the research of different groups so as to build up closer and interest-driven research collaboration. The symposium is aiming at its academic excellence and its objective is to grow up to become a flagship conference on formal software engineering conference in China.  
 To achieve these goals and contribute to the sustainability of the formal methods research, it is important for the symposium to attract young researchers into the community. Thus, this symposium encourages participation of young researchers and students.
