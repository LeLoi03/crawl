 The open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and expression are central to the aims and goals of ISAAC. These require an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and that embraces diversity. ISAAC is committed to providing an environment that is free of discrimination and harassment, and expects all participants to honor that commitment. 
  If you experience or witness discrimination, harassment or other unethical behavior at the conference, we encourage you to seek advice and remedy through one or more of the following options: 
  Consult with the SafeToC counselors of ISAAC. 
  Report to the conference chair, the PC chairs or the Steering committee chair. The chairs are entitled to remove registered participants from the conference (without refunding the conference fees) if they are deemed to pose an ethical risk to other participants.
