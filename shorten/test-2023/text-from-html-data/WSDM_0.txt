 WSDM (pronounced "wisdom") is one of the premier conferences on web-inspired research involving search and data mining. The 16th ACM International WSDM Conference will take place in Singapore (in-person conference with virtual elements), during February 27 to March 3, 2023.   
 WSDM is a highly selective conference that includes invited talks, as well as refereed full papers. WSDM publishes original, high-quality papers related to search and data mining on the Web and the Social Web, with an emphasis on practical yet principled novel models of search and data mining, algorithm design and analysis, economic implications, and in-depth experimental analysis of accuracy and performance.
