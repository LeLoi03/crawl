 20th International Conference on  
  Relational and Algebraic Methods in Computer Science  
  RAMiCS 2023  
 RAMiCS 2023 will take place in Augsburg from 3 to 6 April, 2023  .  
 Theoretical aspects include semigroups, residuated lattices semirings, Kleene algebras, relation algebras, quantales and other algebras; their connections with program logics and other logics; their use in the theories of automata concurrency, formal languages, games, networks and programming languages; the development of algebraic, algorithmic category-theoretic, coalgebraic and proof-theoretic methods for these theories; their formalisation with theorem provers.  
 Applications include tools and techniques for program correctness, specification and verification; quantitative and qualitative models and semantics of computing systems and processes; algorithm design, automated reasoning, network protocol analysis, social choice, optimisation and control.  
 Proceedings  
 The proceedings are available from 30 March 2023 through 30 April 2023 via this link  .

 Submissions must provide sufficient information to judge their merits. Additional material may be provided in a clearly marked appendix or by a reference to a manuscript on a web site. Experimental data, software or mathematical components for theorem provers must be available in sufficient detail for referees. Deviation from these requirements may lead to rejection.  
 As for earlier RAMiCS conferences, we intend to publish a journal special issue with revised and extended versions of a selection of the best papers.
