  About @WAS | History 
  DEXA 2024 | conferences and workshops were held in Naples, Italy from 26 - 28 August 2024 
  iiWAS | and | MoMM | 2024 will be held in Bratislava, Slovakia from 2 - 4 December 2024. 
  The success of the iiWAS series of workshops and conferences and the prospect of continuing the organization of these events in the forthcoming years have encouraged some of us to propose the creation of a non-profit International Organization for Information Integration and Web-based Applications & Services (@WAS). @WAS, in the spirit of the iiWAS conference series, aims at fostering collaborations and exchanges of ideas and information among students, professionals, and researchers interested in the field of information integration and Web applications and services.  The scope of @WAS actions is threefold:  steering the organization of the iiWAS, MoMM and DEXA conferences and workshops,  editing or endorsing scientific publications (books, journals, special issues of journals, and proceedings of meetings), and  organizing or endorsing events (workshop, seminars), and projects.
