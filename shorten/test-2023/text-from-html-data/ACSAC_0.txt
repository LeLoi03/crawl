 The Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC)  brings together cutting-edge researchers, with a broad cross-section of security professionals drawn from academia, industry, and government, gathered to present and discuss the latest security results and topics. With peer reviewed technical papers, invited talks, panels, national interest discussions, and workshops, ACSAC continues its core mission of investigating practical solutions for computer and network security technology.  
 ACSAC will be held at the AT&T Conference Center in Austin, Texas. The hotel is 8 miles from the airport, with many attractions and restaurants within walking distance or a short ride.
