 About The 16th ICMV 2023, Yerevan, Armenia   
 It was on occasion of the 15th ICMV in Rome where we discussed the next topics and location for the forthcoming 2023 conference. Among the conference chairs there was an agreement to put stronger attention to recent findings in tomography and to use as conference place the Russian Armenian University in Yerevan where important contributions to the field were delivered. Thus we had 3 interesting days in Armenia filled with nice presentations and stimulating discussions during Nov. 15-18, 2023   
  - Camera-Based and Mobile Recognition (chaired by Konstantin Bulatov)  
  - Advanced Imaging and Tomography (chaired by Ehrenfried Zschech)  
  - Document Analysis, Recognition, and Forgery Detection: Pioneering Solutions for the Digital Age (chaired by Vladimir Artazarov)  
  - a Poster Session (chaired by Marina Chukalina)   
  The conference ended as usual with an award ceremony for the best papers given in all sessions. 7 awardees could be recognized for their outstanding presentations.
