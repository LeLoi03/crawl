 Call for Papers 
 RTNS is a friendly and inclusive conference with a great sense of community that presents excellent opportunities for discussion and collaboration.  
  This 31st occurrence of RTNS is a special one. First, this 31st edition will be the first occurrence outside France. Second, RTNS offers now two deadlines: one in September, and a second in January (more details below).  
  Important dates  
  First round  
  Abstract submission: Sept. 18th, 2022  
  Paper submission: Sept. 22th, 2022  
  Notification: Nov. 10th, 2022  
  Second round  
  Abstract submission: Jan. 13th, 2023  
  Paper submission: Jan. 17th, 2023  
  Notification: Feb. 25th, 2023  
  Original unpublished papers on all aspects of real-time systems and networks are welcome. Note that RTNS prefers original results, raising questions and discussions, to technical advances understandable only by a few experts.  
  RTNS covers a wide spectrum of topics in real-time and embedded systems, including, but not limited to:  
  * Real-time applications design and evaluation: automotive, avionics, space, railways, telecommunications, process control, multimedia.  
  * Hardware support for real-time systems: hardware/software co-design, power/temperature-aware techniques, design of predictable hardware, multi-core and many-core platforms, hardware accelerators, cache-related issues, interconnect, and memory.  
  Double submission model  
  --------------------------------------  
  RTNS 2023 adopts a double submission model, with two rounds.  
  Submissions done at the first round may be:  
  Rejected: no re-submission possible to the second round  
  Accepted: accepted papers will receive a DOI, the list will be published on the conference WEB site, and the author may put an author version on their own web page. The publication will occur after the conference.  
  Under major revision: the paper may be re-submitted in the second round and will be evaluated again by the same reviewers.  
  Submissions done in the second round may be only accepted or rejected.  
  Submission Guidelines  
  --------------------------------------------  
  Authors are invited to submit English-language research and application papers representing original, previously unpublished work, not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. The papers are limited to 10 two-column pages (not including references) in ACM conference format. The proceedings will be published by well known editor (ongoing discussions). RTNS accepts only full papers. All accepted papers can extend to 11 pages (excluding references) with the extra page only to address reviewers’ comments but not to add new content.  
  RTNS tends to be a community, not a bunch of individual experts. Then, authors are invited to present the results in a way such that the main ideas can be understood by any real-time researcher and lead to discussions and exchanges.  
  As in previous editions, some specific proposal will be done to authors of outstanding papers (discussions still ongoing). Best papers and best student papers awards will be presented at the conference, along with an award for the best presentation.
