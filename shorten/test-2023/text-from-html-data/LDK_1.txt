 Call for Papers  
 Submission Deadline: extended to 27 March 2023  ; final extension: 31 March 2023   
 Invited Speakers  
 We are happy to announce Diana Maynard (University of Sheffield), Ruben Verborgh (Ghent University), and Ruth Wodak (Lancaster University/University of Vienna), as keynote speakers for LDK 2023.  
 Paper Submission  
 We welcome submissions of relevance to the topics listed below. Submissions can be in the form of:  
 Long papers: 9–12 pages; 
 Papers should be submitted via OpenReview at the following address:  
 All articles must represent original work: when submitted, the submission must not have been previously published*, and the material in it must not have been/be submitted for review at another journal or conference while under review at LDK 2023.  
 *This excludes papers on preprint archives, such as arXiv, which we do not consider to have been previously published.  
 The conference will be hybrid (face-to-face and remote). Note that at least one author of each accepted paper must register to present the paper at the conference (either remotely or on-site). There will be no registration fee administered for participating in LDK 2023.  
 Presentation format   
 Accepted submissions will be selected for oral or poster presentation based on recommendations from the reviewers. This decision will not reflect any difference in the quality of the papers, and there will be no distinction between oral and poster presentations in the published proceedings. Authors of accepted short papers or posters are welcome to present their work as a demo in addition to the regular presentation.
