 Overview  
 The Twelfth International Conference on Model & Data Engineering (MEDI) will be held from 2 to 4 November 2023 in Sousse, Tunisia. Its main objective is to provide a forum for the dissemination of research accomplishments and to promote the interaction and collaboration between the models and data research communities. MEDI 2023 provides an international platform for the presentation of research on models and data theory, development of advanced technologies related to models and data and their advanced applications. This international scientific event, initiated by researchers from Euro-Mediterranean countries, aims also at promoting the creation of north-south scientific networks, projects and faculty/student exchanges.  
 Why Sousse?  
 The city is host to many international conferences and other important regional and international events. We have chosen Sousse to host the MEDI-2023 for its exoticism and modernity.
