 ICPRAM 2023 will be held in conjunction with ICAART 2023    and ICISSP 2023    .   
  Registration to ICPRAM allows free access to the ICAART and ICISSP conferences (as a non-speaker).  
  Although the conference is back to the normal mode (i.e., in-person) speakers are allowed to present remotely if unable to travel to the venue (hybrid support).    
 The International Conference on Pattern Recognition Applications and Methods is a major point of contact between researchers, engineers and practitioners on the areas of Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, both from theoretical and application perspectives.
