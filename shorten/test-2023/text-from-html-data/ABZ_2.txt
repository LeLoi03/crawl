  Abstract:  This document presents the case study for the ABZ 2023 conference. The case study introduces a safety critical interactive system called AMAN (Arrival MANager), which is a partly-autonomous scheduler of landing sequences of aircraft in airports. This interactive systems interleaves Air Traffic Controllers activities with automation in AMAN. While some AMAN systems are currently deployed in airports, we consider here only a subset of functions which represent a challenge in modelling and verification.

  Abstract:  Event-B is a state-based correct-by-construction system design formal method relying on proof and refinement where system models are expressed using set theory and First Order Logic (FOL). Through the generation and discharging of proof obligations (POs), Event-B natively supports the establishment of properties such as safety invariant, convergence and refinement. Other properties, relevant to system verification, may be studied as well, but need to be explicitly formalised by the designer, or expressed in another formal method. This process compromises reusability and is error-prone, especially on larger systems. Recently, the reflexive EB4EB framework has been proposed for formalising Event-B concepts as first-class objects. It allows manipulating these concepts using FOL and set theory in Event-B. In this paper, we propose a rigorous methodology for extending the EB4EB framework, to support new system analysis mechanisms associated to properties that are not natively present in core Event-B. Thanks to the reflexive nature of this framework, new generic and reusable system properties and their associated POs are expressed once and for all, and for any refinement level. For specific systems, designers instantiate these properties and the associated POs are automatically generated and submitted to Event-B’s provers. This methodology is used to define three analyses: deadlock-freeness, invariant weakness analysis and reachability, all of which are demonstrated on a case study.

  Abstract:  The present paper describes an Event-B model of the Arrival MANager system (called AMAN), the case study provided by the ABZ’23 conference. The goal of this safety critical interactive system is to schedule the arrival times of aircraft at airports. This system includes two parts: an autonomous part which predicts the arrival time of an aircraft from external sources (flight plan information, radar and weather information, etc.) and an interface part that permits to the Air Traffic Controller (ATCo) to submit requests to AMAN like changes regarding the arrival times of aircraft. To formally model and verify this critical system, we use a correct-by-construction approach with the Event-B formal method and its refinement process. We mainly consider functional features of the case study; all proof obligations have been discharged using the provers of the Rodin platform under which we carried out our development. To help users understand how AMAN works and its main functionalities, a visualisation of the Event-B models was achieved using the VisB component of ProB. Our models have been validated using ProB by applying scenarios related to different functional aspects of the system.

  Abstract:  While refinement can help structure the modeling and proving process, it also forces the modeler to introduce features in a particular order. This means that features deeper in the refinement chain cannot be validated in isolation, making some reasoning unnecessarily intricate. In this paper, we present the AVoiR (Abstraction-Validation Obligation-Refinement) framework to ease validation of such complex refinement chains. The triptych AVoiR framework operates as follows: 1) We first simplify a complex model by abstracting away the noise, i.e., removing the information unrelated to properties under analysis. 2) Using the Validation Obligations (VOs) technique, we formalize the validation tasks of the desired property. 3) Finally, we trickle down the validation results by establishing the noiseless model as a parent of the initially investigated model through the standard refinement relationship. Furthermore, by using the technique of VO refinement, we establish the VOs of the abstract model on the initial model. We use a case study from the aviation domain to show the proposed framework’s effectiveness.
