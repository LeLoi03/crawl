 ESOP is an annual conference devoted to fundamental issues in the specification, design, analysis, and implementation of programming languages and systems. ESOP seeks contributions on all aspects of programming language research including, but not limited to, the following areas: programming paradigms and styles, methods and tools to specify and reason about programs and languages, programming language foundations, methods and tools for implementation, concurrency and distribution, applications and emerging topics.  
 Contributions bridging the gap between theory and practice are particularly welcome.

 Submissions and Review Process  
   ESOP 2023 has just one paper category: regular research papers of maximal 25 pages (excluding bibliography). Submissions are required to follow Springer's LNCS format. Formatting style files and further guidelines for formatting can be found at the Springer website:  
 Additional material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final version - for example, details of proofs - may be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page limit. Reviewers are at liberty to ignore appendices and papers must be understandable without them.  
 The review process is double-blind, with a rebuttal phase. In your submission, omit your names and institutions; refer to your prior work in the third person, just as you refer to prior work by others; do not include acknowledgements that might identify you.  
  Accepted papers will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.  
 Artifacts   
  ESOP 2023 will have a post-paper-acceptance voluntary artifact evaluation. Authors will be welcome to submit artifacts for evaluation after paper notification. The outcome will not alter the paper acceptance decision.
