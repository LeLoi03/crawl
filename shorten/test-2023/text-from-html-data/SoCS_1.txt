 The Seventeenth International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS 2024) from June 6-8, 2024 in Kananaskis, Alberta, Canada. The symposium co-chairs were Ariel Felner and Jiaoyang Li.  
 The International Symposium on Combinatorial Search is meant to bring researchers in such areas together to exchange ideas and cross-fertilize the field. SoCS serves researchers and submissions in all fields that use combinatorial search, including artificial intelligence, planning, robotics, constraint programming, meta-reasoning, operations research, navigation, and bioinformatics. Papers exploring the boundaries between combinatorial search and planning & scheduling research are particularly welcome, given the co-location with the 2024 International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS 2024). The papers included in this issue have been organized into three categories — technical papers, position papers, and extended abstracts.
