 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Data Mining (CIDM)  
 IEEE CIDM 2023 organized by the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society Data Mining Technical Committee is one of the largest and best attended symposia of the of the IEEE Symposium Series of Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI 2023). IEEE CIDM 2023 will bring together researchers and practitioners from around the world to discuss the latest advances in the field of computational intelligence applied to data mining and will act as a major forum for the presentation of recent results in theory, algorithms, systems and applications.  
 Topics  
 Topics related to all aspects of data mining and machine learning, such as theories, algorithms, systems and applications, particularly those based on computational intelligence technologies, are welcome; these include, but are not limited to:
