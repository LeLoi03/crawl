  Abstract: This presentation examines how generative AI empowers manufacturers to build a world-class supply chain by streamlining operations, optimizing logistics, and improving supplier relationships. Generative AI enhances efficiency, reduces costs, and enables smarter, data-driven decisions across the supply chain. Using case studies, attendees will discover how AI fosters innovation, agility, and resilience, transforming supply chain management. The presentation will also explore challenges such as workforce adaptation, technology integration, and ethical considerations, offering insights into how companies can leverage AI to achieve superior supply chain performance and maintain a competitive edge.

  Keynote title: The long and winding road to success in B2B enterprise integration Governance dynamics, Data Platforms, Digital Twins and the promises of AI   
  Abstract: B2B integration has been receiving much interest over the past few decades. The history of B2B enterprise integration has witnessed fascinating successes and dramatic failures. Technology has made spectacular advances, through the emergence of webservices and APIs, Cloud-based integration platforms (iPAAS), data platforms, open data and federated architectures such as data spaces. Recently, digital twins and the rise of scalable AI based integration Agents add to the impressive technology stack that can be brought to the table in B2B projects. Still, the complexity of these projects goes beyond solving technical challenges. Several projects we have studied and contributed to in our research show that achieving sustainable value and success in B2B integration requires a combination of Technical, Ethical, Legal, Social and Business elements. Through a series of examples and longitudinal case studies from various industry sectors, I will show in this talk what lessons were learned and what the researchers can contribute to making B2B integration a less windy road to success.
