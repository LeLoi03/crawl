 On Fully-Secure Honest Majority MPC Without Round Overhead  
  Abstract   
 Fully secure multiparty computation (or guaranteed output delivery) among n  parties can be achieved with perfect security if the number of corruptions t  is less than n  /3, or with statistical security with the help of a broadcast channel if \(t<n/2\)  . In the case of \(t<n/3\)  , it is known that it is possible to achieve linear communication complexity, but at a cost of having a round count of \(\varOmega (\textsf{depth}(C) + n)\)  in the worst case. The number of rounds can be reduced to \(O(\textsf{depth}(C))\)  by either increasing communication, or assuming some correlated randomness (a setting also known as the preprocesing model). For \(t<n/2\)  it is also known that linear communication complexity is achievable, but at the cost of \(\varOmega (\textsf{depth}(C) + n^2)\)  rounds, due to the use of a technique called dispute control. However, in contrast to the \(t<n/3\)  setting, it is not known how to reduce this round count for \(t<n/2\)  to \(O(\textsf{depth}(C))\)  , neither allowing for larger communication, or by using correlated randomness.   
 In this work we make progress in this direction by taking the second route above: we present a fully secure protocol for \(t<n/2\)  in the preprocessing model, that achieves linear communication complexity, and whose round complexity is only \(O(\textsf{depth}(C))\)  , without the additive \(n^2\)  term that appears from the use of dispute control. While on the \(t<n/3\)  such result requires circuits of width \(\varOmega (n)\)  , in our case circuits must be of width \(\varOmega (n^2)\)  , leaving it as an interesting future problem to reduce this gap. Our \(O(\textsf{depth}(C))\)  round count is achieved by avoiding the use of dispute control entirely, relying on a different tool for guaranteeing output. In the \(t<n/3\)  setting when correlated randomness is available, this is done by using error correction to reconstruct secret-shared values, but in the \(t<n/2\)  case the equivalent is robust secret-sharing, which guarantees the reconstruction of a secret in spite of errors. However, we note that a direct use of such tool would lead to quadratic  communication, stemming from the fact that each party needs to authenticate their share towards each other party. At the crux of our techniques lies a novel method for reconstructing a batch of robustly secret-shared values while involving only a linear amount of communication per secret, which may also be of independent interest.

 Broadcast-Optimal Two Round MPC with Asynchronous Peer-to-Peer Channels  
  Abstract   
 In this paper we continue the study of two-round broadcast-optimal MPC, where broadcast is used in one of the two rounds, but not in both. We consider the realistic scenario where the round that does not use broadcast is asynchronous  . Since a first asynchronous round (even when followed by a round of broadcast) does not admit any secure computation, we introduce a new notion of asynchrony which we call \((t_{d}, t_{m})\)  -asynchrony. In this new notion of asynchrony, an adversary can delay or drop up to \(t_{d}\)  of a given party’s incoming messages; we refer to \(t_{d}\)  as the deafness threshold  . Similarly, the adversary can delay or drop up to \(t_{m}\)  of a given party’s outgoing messages; we refer to \(t_{m}\)  as the muteness threshold  .   
 We determine which notions of secure two-round computation are achievable when the first round is \((t_{d}, t_{m})\)  -asynchronous, and the second round is over broadcast. Similarly, we determine which notions of secure two-round computation are achievable when the first round is over broadcast, and the second round is (fully) asynchronous. We consider the cases where a PKI is available, when only a CRS is available but private communication in the first round is possible, and the case when only a CRS is available and no private communication is possible before the parties have had a chance to exchange public keys.   
 Effective Pairings in Isogeny-Based Cryptography  
  Abstract   
 Pairings are useful tools in isogeny-based cryptography and have been used in SIDH/SIKE and other protocols. As a general technique, pairings can be used to move problems about points on curves to elements in finite fields. However, until now, their applicability was limited to curves over fields with primes of a specific shape and pairings seemed too costly for the type of primes that are nowadays often used in isogeny-based cryptography. We remove this roadblock by optimizing pairings for highly-composite degrees such as those encountered in CSIDH and SQISign. This makes the general technique viable again: We apply our low-cost pairing to problems of general interest, such as supersingularity verification and finding full-torsion points, and show that we can outperform current methods, in some cases up to four times faster than the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we analyze how pairings can be used to improve deterministic and dummy-free CSIDH. Finally, we provide a constant-time implementation (in Rust) that shows the practicality of these algorithms.

 Oblivious Pseudo-Random Functions (OPRFs) are a central tool for building modern protocols for authentication and distributed computation. For example, OPRFs enable simple login protocols that do not reveal the password to the provider, which helps to mitigate known shortcomings of password-based authentication such as password reuse or mix-up. Reliable treatment of passwords becomes more and more important as we login to a multitude of services with different passwords in our daily life.   
 To ensure the security and privacy of such services in the long term, modern protocols should always consider the possibility of attackers with quantum computers. Therefore, recent research has focused on constructing post-quantum-secure OPRFs. Unfortunately, existing constructions either lack efficiency, or they are based on complex and relatively new cryptographic assumptions, some of which have lately been disproved.   
 In this paper, we revisit the security and the efficiency of the well-known “OPRFs via Garbled Circuits” approach. Such an OPRF is presumably post-quantum-secure and built from well-understood primitives, namely symmetric cryptography and oblivious transfer. We investigate security in the strong Universal Composability model, which guarantees security even when multiple instances are executed in parallel and in conjunction with arbitrary other protocols, which is a realistic scenario in today’s internet. At the same time, it is faster than other current post-quantum-secure OPRFs. Our implementation and benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed OPRF is currently among the best choices if the privacy of the data has to be guaranteed for a long time.

 Physical Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Five Cells  
  Abstract   
 Five Cells is a logic puzzle consisting of a rectangular grid, with some cells containing a number. The player has to partition the grid into pentominoes such that the number in each cell must be equal to the number of edges of that cell that are borders of pentominoes. In this paper, we propose two physical zero-knowledge proof protocols for Five Cells using a deck of playing cards, which allow a prover to physically show that he/she knows a solution of the puzzle without revealing it. In the optimization of our first protocol, we also develop a technique to reduce the number of required cards from quadratic to linear in the number of cells, which can be used in other zero-knowledge proof protocols related to graph coloring as well.
