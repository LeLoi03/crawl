 Prof. Dimitrios Buhalis  , Bournemouth University, Poole, UK    
 IFITT and ENTER have been, and are, an incredible environment for the evolution of the whole eTourism field and for my personal development as a scholar. Besides that, it is a wonderful community in which discussions, collaborations, chats and friendships develop almost spontaneously and with great value for all those who are involved
