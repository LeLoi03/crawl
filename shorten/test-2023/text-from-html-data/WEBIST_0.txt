 WEBIST 2023 will be held in conjunction with icSPORTS 2023    , CHIRA 2023    , IJCCI 2023    and IC3K 2023    .   
  Registration to WEBIST allows free access to the icSPORTS, CHIRA, IJCCI and IC3K conferences (as a non-speaker).  
  Although the conference is back to the normal mode (i.e., in-person) speakers are allowed to present remotely if unable to travel to the venue (hybrid support).    
 The purpose of the International Conference on Web Information Systems and Technologies (WEBIST) is to bring together researchers, engineers and practitioners interested in the technological advances and business applications of web-based information systems. The conference has four main tracks, covering different aspects of Web Information Systems, namely Internet Technology, Web Intelligence and Semantic Web, Social Network Analytics, HCI in Mobile Systems and Web Interfaces.  
  WEBIST focuses on real world applications; therefore authors should highlight the benefits of Web Information Systems and Technologies for industry and services, in addition to academic applications.
