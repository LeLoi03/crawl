  Program 
 At present, popular parallel and distributed programming methodologies are dominated by low-level techniques such as send/receive message passing, or equivalently unstructured shared memory mechanisms.  
 Higher-level, structured approaches offer many possible advantages and have a key role to play in the scalable exploitation of ubiquitous parallelism.  
 HLPP symposia provide a forum for discussion and research about such high-level approaches to parallel and distributed programming.  
 Topics  
 HLPP 2023 invites papers on all topics in high-level parallel programming, its tools and applications including, but not limited to, the following aspects:  
 High-level parallel programming and performance models (e.g. BSP, CGM, LogP, MPM, etc.) and tools 
  Declarative parallel and distributed programming methodologies based on functional, logical, data-flow, actor, and other paradigms 
  Applications of parallel and distributed systems using high-level languages and tools 
  Teaching experience with high-level tools and methods for parallel and distributed computing
