 ACM International Conference on Supporting Group Work (GROUP)*  
 Monthly Featured   
 The biennial ACM International Conference on Supporting Group Work (GROUP)  , supported by the Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Group on Human-Computer Interaction (ACM SIGHCI), formerly the ACM SIGGROUP Conference on Supporting Group Work (GROUP), the Conference on Organizational Computing Systems (COOCS), and the ACM SIGOIS (and IEEE CS TC-OA) Conference on Office Information Systems (COCS), is a premier venue for research on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, Human Computer Interaction, Computer Supported Collaborative Learning and Socio-Technical Studies. A strong emphasis of GROUP conferences is to foster a discourse on collaborative technology that bridges the fields of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Information Systems (IS), Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL), and “Learning at the workplace” (CSCL@Work). Relevant issues include the design, implementation, deployment, evaluation, and impact of these systems as well as examinations of relevant research methodologies. The conference integrates work in social science, computer science, engineering, design, values, and other diverse topics related to group work, broadly conceptualized.
