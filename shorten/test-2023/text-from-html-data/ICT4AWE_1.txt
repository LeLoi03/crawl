  VENUE  
 The conference will be held at the Vienna House by Wyndham Diplomat Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.  
 The Vienna House by Wyndham Diplomat Prague is located in the diplomatic district, close to the historic centre. Where better to meet and enjoy the good life than where diplomacy prevails? The hotel is one of the most popular conference venues and the views over the rooftops alone make a visit worthwhile. From the wellness area the Castle seem within one's grasp.
