  SIAM Conference on Optimization  
  Tutorial on Riemannian Optimization  
 Here are the slides used during the tutorial  .  
 These are the Manopt example codes for Max-Cut  in Matlab.  
 The tutorial builds on my book published by Cambridge University Press  , 2023.  
 Go to the book webpage  for more info the free pre-publication pdf, lecture material (videos and slides of a full semester course) and exercises with solutions.  
 For software, check out the Manopt toolboxes, in Matlab  , Python  and Julia  . You can also find a list of much more Riemannian optimization software here  .
