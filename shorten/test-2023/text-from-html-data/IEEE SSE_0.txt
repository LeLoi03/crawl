The Best Paper Awards will be sponsored by Springer, which is a leading global scientific, technical and medical portfolio, providing researchers in academia, scientific institutions and corporate R&D departments with quality content through innovative information, products and services.  
 Extended versions of selected papers will be invited for special issues in the related journals including IJWSR(SCI), Electronics (SCI IF=2.9),Sustainability (SCI and SSCI, IF=3.9), Remote Sensing (SCI, IF=5.0), Mathematics (SCI, IF=2.4), Journal of Cybersecurity and Privacy,STBD, STSC, STCC, STIOT and IJBPIM.  
 Topics  
 SCC 2024 organizing committee invites you to participate in 2024 edition of SCC, to be held on November 16 - 19, 2024, Bangkok, Thailand.  
 The technical program of SCC 2024 will include a Research Track, an Application Track, and a Short Paper Track. The SCC 2024 tracks seeks original, UNPUBLISHED research papers reporting substantive new work in various aspects of Services Computing technologies and applications. Research Track papers MUST clearly indicate their contributions to the field of Services Computing technologies, applications and solutions. All papers MUST properly cite related work in the field, such as those published in the proceedings of ICWS, SCC, CLOUD, AIMS, SERVICES, BigData, ICIOT, ICBC, EDGE, APSCC, ECOWS, and related journals including STBD, JWSR, STSC, STCC, STIOT and IJBPIM (see Literature Recommendations  page).  
 SCC 2024 covers state-of-the-art technologies and best practices of Services Computing, as well as emerging standards and research topics which would define the future of Services Computing. The global nature of Services Computing leads to many opportunities and challenges and creates a new networked economic structure for supporting different business models. SCC 2024 will continue to help in bridging the gap between business services and information technology by driving research in technologies such as service-oriented architecture (SOA), business process integration and management, service engineering, cloud computing, blockchain, big data, and AI.  
 SCC covers the whole lifecycle of innovation research and enabling technologies, which includes enterprise modeling, business consulting, solution creation, services delivery, services orchestration, services optimization, services management, services marketing, services delivery and cloud computing, service-oriented architecture (SOA), business process integration and management, and Web services technologies and standards.
