 ==============================  ========================  
 AlgoSensors is an international symposium dedicated to the algorithmic aspects of wireless networks. Originally focused on sensor networks, it now covers algorithmic issues arising in wireless networks of all types of computational entities, static or mobile, including sensor networks, sensor-actuator networks, autonomous robots. The focus is on the design and analysis of algorithms, models of computation, and experimental analysis.  
 Submissions are sought in all areas of wireless networking, broadly construed, including both theoretical and experimental perspectives. This year AlgoSensors has two tracks:  
 – Algorithms & Theory  
 – Experiments & Applications  
 Each paper may be submitted only to one track.  
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 – Ad Hoc Networks  
 – Virtual Infrastructures  
 – Wireless Networks  
 Submission guidelines:  
 Papers are to be submitted electronically using the EasyChair server. Original research papers must contain results that have not previously appeared and have not been concurrently submitted to a journal or conference with published proceedings. Each paper should select one of the two tracks (Algorithms & Theory or Experiments & Applications) for submission. Authors need to ensure that for each accepted paper at least one author will register and attend the symposium.  
  Submissions are limited to twelve (12) single-column pages in the LNCS format. This includes figures, but excludes references and an optional appendix (to be read at the program committee’s discretion). Papers will be published by LNCS after the conference.  
 Awards:  
  The best paper from each track will be given a Best Paper Award.
