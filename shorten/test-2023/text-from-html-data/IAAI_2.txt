 The Thirty-Sixth Annual Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence (IAAI-24) February 22-24,2024  
 The Thirty-Sixth Annual Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence (IAAI-24) is a venue for papers describing highly innovative realizations of AI technology. The objective of the conference is to showcase successful applications and novel uses of AI. The conference will use technical papers, best practice papers, invited talks, and panel discussions to explore issues, methods, and lessons learned in the development and deployment of AI applications; and to promote an interchange of ideas between basic and applied AI and the discourse on the actual deployment of AI in practice. The general goal of the conference is to teach people the challenges and solutions to accomplishing something useful in the real world, as opposed to describing a new algorithm.

 Tracks with Accepted Papers  
  Deployed Highly Innovative Applications of AIâ€‹  
 Papers submitted to this track must describe deployed applications with measurable benefits that include an innovative use of AI technology. Applications are defined as deployed once they are in production use by their final end-users and the in-use experience can be meaningfully collected and reported. The study may evaluate either a stand-alone application or a component of a complex system.
