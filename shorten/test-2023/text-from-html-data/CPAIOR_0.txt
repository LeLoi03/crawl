 About CPAIOR    
 The aim of the CPAIOR conference series is to bring together interested researchers from Constraint Programming (CP), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Operations Research (OR) to present new techniques or new applications, and to provide an opportunity for researchers in one area to learn about techniques in the others. A main objective of this conference series is to give researchers the opportunity to show how the integration of techniques from different fields can lead to interesting results on large and complex problems.   
 Typically, papers presented at CPAIOR actively combine, integrate, or contrast approaches from more than one of the areas. High quality papers from a single area are usually also welcome. Finally, application papers showcasing CP/AI/OR techniques on innovative and challenging applications or experience reports on such applications have been strongly encouraged.   
 Proceedings of this peer-reviewed conference are published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. In some cases, a selection of papers is published in a special issue of a journal after another round of reviewing. This has been standardized in recent years via a Journal Fast-Track reviewing process.
