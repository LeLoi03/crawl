 NEWS  – The “Industrial Vision Systems – IVS@ICVS2023” workshop unfortunately had to be cancelled  
 The 14th International Conference on Computer Vision Systems  (ICVS 2023) will be held in person on Wednesday to Friday 27-29 September 2023, continuing a series of successful events in in Europe, America and Asia.  
 The conference aims to gather researchers and developers from both academia and industry worldwide and to explore the state of the art and the prospects of computer vision systems  . The perspective on systems that ICVS historically has, offers a unique opportunity for sharing competence in application development and for elaborating on challenging application-driven research questions.  
 In this context, ICVS 2023 will focus on key application areas for advanced computer vision systems, including but not limited to robotics, healthcare and assisted living and surveillance.  
 As in the previous conferences, the ICVS 2023 proceedings will be submitted for publication to Springer, Lecture Notes in Computer Science.  
 Along with the main technical program, ICVS 2023 aims to host a series of workshops focusing on challenging computer vision applications, as well as a tutorial and an exhibition, so as to bring together academics, researchers and industrial players  working in computer vision to socialise and network together, present their research progress and address new challenges in the field.  
 This edition will be held at the following location (see on interactive maps  ):
