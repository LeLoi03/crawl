  Implications for Further Research: | Discussion on how the findings can influence future research directions and methodologies. 
  Experience Papers | must adhere to the same submission guidelines as research papers, including an | ‚ÄúExperience‚Äù | prefix in the title for clear differentiation. 
 Submitting a Paper    
  Submissions will be judged on novelty, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and correctness. Accepted papers will optionally be shepherded through an editorial review process by a member of the program committee. COMSNETS uses double-blind reviewing.   
  A high-quality paper should:  
 Identify and elucidate a significant problem or challenge within its domain. 
  Offer a novel and captivating solution that piques interest and sparks discussion. 
  Showcase the practicality and advantages of the proposed solution through concrete evidence and real-world scenarios. 
  Present well-founded conclusions that logically follow from the research findings. 
  Provide a clear and comprehensive description of the paper‚Äôs contributions to the field. 
  Articulate the advancements achieved beyond the existing body of work, highlighting the innovative aspects of the research.

  Accepted papers will generally be available online to registered attendees before the conference. If your accepted paper should not be published prior to the event, please notify [email protected]   . The papers will be available online to everyone beginning on the first day of the conference.  
 Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty or fraud.

Authors should email the program co-chairs, [email protected]   , a copy of the related workshop paper and a short explanation of the new material in the conference paper beyond that published in the workshop version.  
 ArXiv Policy: Prior or concurrent publication in non-peer-reviewed contexts, like arXiv.org, technical reports, talks, and social media posts, is permitted. However, your COMSNETS submission must use an anonymized name for your project or system that differs from any used in such contexts.
