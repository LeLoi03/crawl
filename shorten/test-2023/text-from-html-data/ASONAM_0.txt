  For more than a century, social networks have been studied in a variety of disciplines including sociology, anthropology, psychology, and economics. The Internet, the social Web, and other large-scale, socio-technological infrastructures have triggered a growing interest and significant methodological advancements in social network analysis and mining. Method development in graph theory, statistics, data mining and machine learning, and statistical mechanics is inspired by new research problems and, in turn, opens up further possibilities for application. These spiraling trends have led to a rising prominence of social network analysis and mining methods and tools in academia, politics, security, and business.  
  The international conference series on Advances in Social Network Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2023) provides an interdisciplinary venue that brings together researchers and practitioners from a broad variety of fields to promote collaborations and exchange of ideas and practices. ASONAM 2023 is intended to address important aspects with a specific focus on emerging trends and industry needs. The conference solicits empirical, experimental, methodological, and theoretical research reporting original and unpublished results on social network analysis and mining along with applications.
