 Abstract:  Wi-Fi sensing systems leverage wireless signals from widely deployed Wi-Fi devices to realize sensing for a broad range of applications. However, current Wi-Fi sensing systems heavily rely on channel state information (CSI) to learn the signal propagation characteristics, while the availability of CSI is highly dependent on specific Wi-Fi chipsets. Through a city-scale measurement, we discover that the availability of CSI is extremely limited in operational Wi-Fi devices. In this work, we propose a new wireless sensing system called BeamSense that exploits compressed beamforming reports (CBR). Due to the extensive support of transmit beamforming in operational Wi-Fi devices, CBR is commonly accessible and hence enables a ubiquitous sensing capability. BeamSense adopts a novel multi-path estimation algorithm that can efficiently and accurately map bidirectional CBR to a multi-path channel based on intrinsic fingerprints. We implement BeamSense on several prevalent models of Wi-Fi devices and evaluated its performance with microbenchmarks and three representative Wi-Fi sensing applications. The results show that BeamSense is capable of enabling existing CSI-based sensing algorithms to work with CBR with high sensing accuracy and improved generalizability.

 Abstract:  BGP reconfigurations are a daily occurrence for most network operators, especially in large networks. Yet, performing safe and robust BGP reconfiguration changes is still an open problem. Few BGP reconfiguration techniques exist, and they are either (i)  unsafe, because they ignore transient states, which can easily lead to invariant violations; or (ii)  impractical, as they duplicate the entire routing and forwarding states, and require special hardware. | In this paper, we introduce Chameleon, the first BGP reconfiguration framework capable of maintaining correctness throughout a reconfiguration campaign while relying on standard BGP functionalities and minimizing state duplication. Akin to concurrency coordination in distributed systems, Chameleon models the reconfiguration process with happens-before relations. This modeling allows us to capture the safety properties of transient BGP states. We then use this knowledge to precisely control the BGP route propagation and convergence, so that input invariants are provably preserved at any time during the reconfiguration. | We fully implement Chameleon and evaluate it in both testbeds and simulations, on real-world topologies and large-scale reconfiguration scenarios. In most experiments, our system computes reconfiguration plans within a minute, and performs them from start to finish in a few minutes, with minimal overhead.

 Abstract:  It is notoriously difficult to verify that a network is behaving as intended, especially at scale. This paper presents Hydra, a system that uses ideas from runtime verification to check that every packet is correctly processed with respect to a specification in real time. We propose a domain-specific language for writing properties, called Indus and we develop a compiler that turns properties thus specified into executable P4 code that runs alongside the forwarding code at line rate. To evaluate our approach, we used Indus to model a range of properties, showing that it is expressive enough to capture examples studied in prior work. We also deployed Hydra checkers for validating paths in source routing and for enforcing slice isolation in Aether, an open-source cellular platform. We confirmed a subtle bug in Aether’s 5G mobile core that would have been hard to detect using static techniques. We also evaluated the overheads of Hydra on hardware, finding that it does not significantly increase latency and often does not require additional pipeline stages.

 Abstract:  Mission critical systems deployed in data centers today are facing more sophisticated failures. Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) protocols are capable of masking these types of failures, but are rarely deployed due to their performance cost and complexity. In this work, we propose a new approach to designing high performance BFT protocols in data centers. By re-examining the ordering responsibility between the network and the BFT protocol, we advocate a new abstraction offered by the data center network infrastructure. Concretely, we design a new authenticated ordered multicast primitive (AOM) that provides transferable authentication and non-equivocation guarantees. Feasibility of the design is demonstrated by two hardware implementations of AOM – one using HMAC and the other using public key cryptography for authentication – on new-generation programmable switches. We then co-design a new BFT protocol, NeoBFT, that leverages the guarantees of AOM to eliminate cross-replica coordination and authentication in the common case. Evaluation results show that NeoBFT outperforms state-of-the-art protocols on both latency and throughput metrics by a wide margin, demonstrating the benefit of our new network ordering abstraction for BFT systems.

 Abstract:  To mitigate IPv4 exhaustion, IPv6 provides expanded address space, and NAT allows a single public IPv4 address to suffice for many devices assigned private IPv4 address space. Even though NAT has greatly extended the shelf-life of IPv4, some networks need more private IPv4 space than what is officially allocated by IANA due to their size and/or network management practices. Some of these networks resort to using squat space, a term the network operations community uses for large public IPv4 address blocks allocated to organizations but historically never announced to the Internet. While squatting of IP addresses is an open secret, it introduces ethical, legal, and technical problems. In this work we examine billions of traceroutes to identify thousands of organizations squatting. We examine how they are using it and what happened when the US Department of Defense suddenly started announcing what had traditionally been squat space. In addition to shining light on a dirty secret of operational practices, our paper shows that squatting distorts common Internet measurement methodologies, which we argue have to be re-examined to account for squat space. 
  The Packet Number Space Debate in Multipath QUIC  
 Quentin De Coninck ( UCLouvain  ) 
 Abstract:  With a standardization process that attracted much interest, QUIC can been seen as the next general-purpose transport protocol. Still, it does not provide true multipath support yet, missing some use cases that Multipath TCP addresses. To fill that gap, the IETF recently adopted a Multipath proposal merging several proposed designs. While it focuses on its core components, there still remains one major design issue: the amount of packet number spaces that should be used. This paper provides experimental results with two different Multipath QUIC implementations based on NS3 simulations to understand the impact of using one packet number space per path or a single packet number space for the whole connection. Our results show that using one packet number space per path makes Multipath QUIC more resilient to the receiver's heuristics to acknowledge packets and detect duplicates.

 Abstract:  Traffic aggregates in cloud data center networks are by and large buffered and transmitted by simple physical FIFO queues. Despite the crucial role they play, a well-known problem of physical FIFO queues is that they are unable to provide precise bandwidth guarantees. This leads to a range of negative impacts spanning the application layer, the transport layer, and the data link layer. | In this paper, we address this problem with Augmented Queue (AQ), a scalable in-network abstraction that provides precise bandwidth guarantees for traffic constituents. AQ serves multiple valuable use cases in data center networks. For example, AQ facilitates the isolation of traffic from different applications; ensures that different congestion control algorithms can properly co-exist; and enforces inbound and outbound bandwidth for virtual machines. We demonstrate via testbed and simulation experiments that AQ can provide precise bandwidth guarantees and scale to millions of traffic constituents.

 Abstract:  Serverless computing provides fine-grained  resource elasticity for data analytics—a job can flexibly scale its resources for each  stage instead of sticking to a fixed pool of resources throughout  its lifetime. Due to different data dependencies and different shuffling overheads caused by intra- and inter-server communication, the best degree of parallelism (DoP) for each stage varies based on runtime conditions. | We present Ditto, a job scheduler for serverless analytics that leverages fine-grained resource elasticity to optimize for job completion time (JCT) and cost. The key idea of Ditto is to use a new scheduling granularity— stage group  —to decouple parallelism configuration from function placement. Ditto bundles stages into stage groups based on their data dependencies and IO characteristics. It exploits the parallelized time characteristics of the stages to determine the parallelism configuration, and prioritizes the placement of stage groups with large shuffling traffic, so that the stages in these groups can leverage zero-copy intra-server communication for efficient shuffling. We build a system prototype of Ditto and evaluate it with a variety of benchmarking workloads. Experimental results show that Ditto outperforms existing solutions by up to 2.5× on JCT and up to 1.8× on cost.

 Abstract:  In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive longitudinal analysis of government-ordered Internet shutdowns and spontaneous outages (i.e., disruptions not ordered by the government). We describe the available tools, data sources and methods to identify and analyze Internet shutdowns. We then merge manually curated datasets on known government-ordered shutdowns and large-scale Internet outages, further augmenting them with data on real-world events, macroeconomic and sociopolitical indicators, and network operator statistics. Our analysis confirms previous findings on the economic and political profiles of countries with government-ordered shutdowns. Extending this analysis, we find that countries with national-scale spontaneous outages often have profiles similar to countries with shutdowns, differing from countries that experience neither. However, we find that government-ordered shutdowns are many more times likely to occur on days of mobilization, coinciding with elections, protests, and coups. Our study also characterizes the temporal characteristics of Internet shutdowns and finds that they differ significantly in terms of duration, recurrence interval, and start times when compared to spontaneous outages.

 Abstract:  In cloud gaming, interactive latency is one of the most important factors in users' experience. Although the interactive latency can be reduced through typical network infrastructures like edge caching and congestion control, the interactive latency of current cloud-gaming platforms is still far from users' satisfaction. This paper presents ZGaming, a novel 3D cloud gaming system based on image prediction, in order to eliminate the interactive latency in traditional cloud gaming systems. To improve the quality of the predicted images, we propose (1) a quality-driven 3D-block cache to reduce the "hole" artifacts, (2) a server-assisted LSTM-predicting algorithm to improve the prediction accuracy of dynamic foreground objects, and (3) a prediction-performance-driven adaptive bitrate strategy which optimizes the quality of predicted images. The experiment on the real-world cloud gaming network conditions shows that compared with existing methods, ZGaming reduces the interactive latency from 23 ms to 0 ms when providing the same video quality, or improves the video quality by 5.4 dB when keeping the interactive latency as 0 ms. 
  PacketGame: Multi-Stream Packet Gating for Concurrent Video Inference at Scale

 Abstract:  In this paper, we consider the task of answering what-if questions in the context of adaptive bit rate (ABR) video streaming without access to randomized control trials (RCTs) (e.g., no A/B testing) – i.e., given recorded data of an existing deployed system, what would be the performance impact if we changed its design. Our work makes three contributions. First, we show the problem is challenging since data may only be available for a single ABR algorithm without RCTs, and since it is necessary to deal with the cascading effects that past ABR decisions have on future decisions. Next we present Veritas, the first framework that tackles causal reasoning for video streaming without requiring data collected through RCTs. Integral to Veritas is an easy-to-interpret domain-specific ML model that relates the latent stochastic process (intrinsic bandwidth that the video session can achieve) to actual observations (download times), while exploiting counterfactual queries via abduction using the observed TCP states (e.g., congestion window) for blocking the cascading dependencies. Third, we evaluate Veritas’s ability to accurately answer a wide range of what-if questions using emulation experiments, and data of real video sessions from Puffer. The results show that (i) Veritas accurately tackles a wider range of what-if questions (e.g., change of buffer size or video quality) that existing approaches cannot; (ii) Veritas without RCT training data achieves performance comparable or better than a recent parallel approach that requires RCT data; and (iii) in many scenarios Veritas achieves accuracy close to an ideal oracle.

 Abstract:  On-demand streaming video traffic is managed by an adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithm whose job is to optimize quality of experience (QoE) for a single video session. ABR algorithms leave the question of sharing network resources up to transport-layer algorithms. We observe that as the internet gets faster relative to video streaming rates, this delegation of responsibility gives video traffic a burstier on-off traffic pattern. In this paper, we show we can substantially smooth video traffic to improve its interactions with the rest of the internet, while maintaining the same or better QoE for streaming video. We smooth video traffic with two design principles: application-informed pacing, which allows ABR algorithms to set an upper limit on packet-by-packet throughput, and by designing ABR algorithms that work with pacing. We propose a joint ABR and rate-control scheme, called Sammy, which selects both video quality and pacing rates. We implement our scheme and evaluate it at a large video streaming service. Our approach smooths video, making it a more friendly neighbor to other internet applications. One surprising result is that it requires no compromise for the video traffic: in large scale, production experiments, Sammy improves video QoE over an existing, finely-tuned production ABR algorithm.

 Abstract:  Recent network telemetry solutions typically target programmable switches to achieve high performance and in-network visibility. They partition the packet stream into windows and then apply various stream processing techniques to summarize flow-level statistics. However, existing studies focus on the measurement within each window. Window management is still a missing piece due to the resource limitation of programmable switches. In this paper, we propose OmniWindow, a general and efficient window mechanism framework. OmniWindow splits the original window into fine-grained sub-windows such that the sub-windows can be merged into various window types. To deal with the resource restriction, OmniWindow carefully designs its data plane memory layout and proposes a window synchronization method. It also employs a collaborative architecture that can collect and reset stateful data in sub-windows within a limited time. We prototype OmniWindow on Tofino. We incorporate OmniWindow into a SOTA query-driven telemetry system and eight sketch-based telemetry algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that OmniWindow enables these telemetry solutions to achieve higher accuracy than conventional window mechanism. 
  ChameleMon: Shifting Measurement Attention as Network State Changes

 Abstract:  Network measurement is critical to many network applications. There are mainly two kinds of flow-level measurement tasks: 1) packet accumulation tasks and 2) packet loss tasks. In practice, the two kinds of tasks are often required at the same time, but existing works seldom handle both. In this paper, we design ChameleMon to support the two kinds of tasks simultaneously. The key design of ChameleMon is to shift measurement attention as network state changes, through two dimensions of dynamics: 1) dynamically allocating memory between the two kinds of tasks; 2) dynamically monitoring the flows of importance. To realize the key design, we propose a key technique, leveraging Fermat’s little theorem to devise a flexible data structure, namely FermatSketch. FermatSketch is dividable, additive, and subtractive, supporting the two kinds of tasks. We have implemented a ChameleMon prototype on a testbed with a Fat-tree topology. We conduct extensive experiments and the results show ChameleMon supports the two kinds of tasks with low memory/bandwidth overhead, and more importantly, it can automatically shift measurement attention as network state changes.

 Abstract:  The data plane cache, a critical functionality found in numerous network devices, such as programmable switches, intelligent NICs, and DPUs, is often subject to limitations in its programmability and memory access capacity. As a result, the majority of existing data plane caches rely on simple and inefficient replacement policies. This paper is set to introduce LRU, a near-optimal replacement policy, into the programmable data plane. We first explore the reasons why the traditional implementation of LRU is not suitable for deployment on the data plane. Consequently, we propose P4LRU, a pipeline-optimized version of the LRU implementation. Building on P4LRU, we conceive three distinct in-network systems – LruTable, LruIndex, and LruMon, and successfully bring them to life on Tofino switches. Our thorough experimental trials establish that P4LRU provides a significant performance boost over existing data plane caches in these three systems. We have open-sourced the source codes for the three systems on GitHub.

 Abstract:  Memory disaggregation allows applications running on compute servers to expand their pool of available memory capacity by leveraging remote resources through low-latency networks. Unfortunately, in existing software-level disaggregation frameworks, the simple act of issuing requests to remote memory—paid on every access—can consume many CPU cycles. This overhead represents a direct cost to disaggregation, not only on the throughput of remote memory access but also on application logic, which must contend with the framework’s CPU overheads. In this paper, we present Cowbird, a memory disaggregation architecture that frees compute servers to fulfill their stated purpose by removing disaggregation-related logic from their CPUs. Our experimental evaluation shows that Cowbird eliminates disaggregation overhead on compute-server CPUs and can improve end-to-end performance by up to 3.5x compared to RDMA-only communication.

 Abstract:  Hardware offloaded network stacks are widely adopted in modern datacenters to meet the demand for high throughput, ultra-low latency and low CPU overhead. To fully leverage their exceptional performance, users need to have a deep understanding of their behaviors. Despite many efforts on testing software network stacks, hardware network stacks impose unique challenges to testing tools due to their kernel bypass nature and high performance. | In this paper, we present Lumina, a tool to test the correctness and performance of hardware network stacks. Lumina leverages network programmability to emulate various network scenarios at line rate. With user-friendly interfaces, Lumina enables developers to inject deterministic events, thus facilitating the development of precise and reproducible tests. Given the limited resource and flexibility of programmable network devices, we mirror all the packets to dedicated servers and dump them for offline analysis. We leverage Lumina to test four RDMA NICs from NVIDIA and Intel, and identify bugs that can significantly degrade performance or mislead network operations. Lumina also enables us to capture unexpected micro-behaviors which are missing or not clearly described in public documents and specifications. Vendors have confirmed the critical bugs we discovered and will include bug fixes in future releases.
