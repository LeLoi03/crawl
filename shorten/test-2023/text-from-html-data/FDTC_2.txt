FDTC 2023: Workshop History  
 People and topics  
 The Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography (FDTC) workshop brings together researchers and engineers from academia and industry who have an interest in the effect of faults, accidental or malicious, on digital devices that implement cryptographic algorithms.  
 The FDTC workshop includes topics such as: modeling the reliability of cryptographic systems and protocols; reliable cryptographic systems and algorithms; fault models for HW and SW cryptographic devices; fault injection attacks on cryptographic systems and protocols; classical and novel techniques of fault diagnosis and tolerance for cryptographic systems; and case studies.
