 The conference was a fantastic event with a large number of highly interesting technical presentations. The topics showcased the current research areas in the industry and the challenges associated with them. The opportunity to network with like-minded people enabled interesting discussions and inspired and motivated me for my further research. Special thanks must go to the excellent organisation of the conference, which ensured that everything ran perfectly well. Overall, the event was an enriching experience that has further strengthened my interest.

 A significant number of contributions at this year's INDIN conference concerned the fascinating topic of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This clearly reflects the growing importance of AI at my company ABB as well, as the increasing digital transformation in our industries opens up diverse applications for AI.  
 Here, a challenge will be to make the predictions of AI models more explainable for industrial users, so that AI can genuinely provide valuable support to them. To address this issue, we were truly grateful for the opportunity to host a special session at the INDIN 2023 on the issue of Explainable AI (XAI) and interactive Machine Learning for industrial applications.  
 Our heartfelt appreciation goes to the conference chairs, organizers, and the many dedicated helpers who made this conference an outstanding success, featuring a highly engaging program, all made possible at the cutting-edge university campus of TH OWL in Lemgo.

The event boasted an impressive lineup of distinguished speakers, delivering profound insights, alongside numerous high-quality scientific articles. The gala dinner was a standout, leaving a lasting impression on the attendees. Special recognition goes to the co-chairs, Prof. Lukasz Wisniewski and Prof. Juergen Jasperneite, and the entire local team in Lemgo for their outstanding efforts. Undoubtedly, this year’s conference ranks among the finest I’ve ever attended, and it was a privilege to be part of such remarkable gathering.

 INDIN 2023 at Lemgo is such a wonderful conference, and I am so happy to participate. Discussion of innovation driven industrial informatics, sustainable development of ecosystem such as OWL, and from Lemgo to the whole world: a global network of local innovative communities, is so impressive and forward-looking. Of course, the deep hospitality and well-organized activities are also very impressive!
