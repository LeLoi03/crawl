  Statement on Russian-affiliated Papers in the CCC Program  
 The CCF board extensively discussed the issue of allowing papers from scientists affiliated with Russia in the CCC program. Allowing them was not an easy decision, but it is one we feel is aligned with CCF's principles. We condemn the Russian Federation's war on Ukraine in the strongest possible terms. Our inclusion of some papers with Russian-affiliated authors is in no way to be construed as an endorsement of the Russian government or its actions.
