 18th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE   
  September 18 - 22, 2023 / Ivano-Frankivs’k, UKRAINE   
 on ICT in EDUCATION, RESEARCH,  
  and INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS    
 Dear Colleague,  
 ICTERI supports and respects all the aspects that help promote diversity in our conference community, which aspires to facilitate a truly international and multicultural gathering. Though we prefer physical assembly for the conference as the most effective mean for scientific exchange and community building, we fully understand that some people might be under higher risk or stricter constraints, like international travellers. This is the reason for our decision to run ICTERI 2023 in a hybrid mode  , which combines physical assembly and virtual participation for those colleagues, who are unable to attend physically due to valid reasons.  
 ICTERI Conference Language  is ENGLISH  
 ICTERI  is a peer-reviewed  International Computer Science  conference that brings together academics and practitioners interested in the technological advances and business applications of Information and Communication Technologies and Infrastructures.  
 ICTERI focuses on real world applications  ; therefore authors should highlight the benefits of their results or experience for industry and services, in addition to academic world. Papers describing advanced prototypes  , systems  , tools  and techniques  and general survey  papers indicating future directions  are also encouraged. Both technological  and methodological  submissions are welcome. All papers must describe original work  , not previously published or submitted elsewhere.
