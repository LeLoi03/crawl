 The research was presented on Thursday morning (06/07/23) during session 10, entitled “ Play for social and environmental changes: focus on farmers as players   ”. It was the occasion to present the game, to justify its use, present the first results, and have inspiring talks with the other panelists, also working with farmers with participatory simulations and serious games. The presentation was then followed by a discussion between the six panelists from session 10, answering questions from the public.  
 Finally, participating in ISAGA 2023 allowed us to follow up or discover inspiring research considering the way to approach gaming in research in developing countries, from design and conception to ethics and actual use.
