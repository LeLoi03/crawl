 Abstract:  The quest for transparency in black-box models has gained significant momentum in recent years. In particular, discovering the underlying machine learning technique type (or model family) from the performance of a black-box model is a real important problem both for better understanding its behaviour and for developing strategies to attack it by exploiting the weaknesses intrinsic to the learning technique. In this paper, we tackle the challenging task of identifying which kind of machine learning model is behind the predictions when we interact with a black-box model. Our innovative method involves systematically querying a black-box model (oracle) to  …  label an artificially generated dataset, which is then used to train different surrogate models using machine learning techniques from different families (each one trying to partially approximate the oracle’s behaviour). We present two approaches based on similarity measures, one selecting the most similar family and the other using a conveniently constructed meta-model. In both cases, we use both crisp and soft classifiers and their corresponding similarity metrics. By experimentally comparing all these methods, we gain valuable insights into the explanatory and predictive capabilities of our model family concept. This provides a deeper understanding of the black-box models and increases their transparency and interpretability, paving the way for more effective decision making.  Show more

 Abstract:  Empirical evidence has shown that forecast combination can improve the prediction accuracy of tourism demand forecasting. This paper aimed to develop a more accurate grey forecast combination method (GFCM) with multivariate grey prediction models In light of the practical applicability of grey prediction, which is not required to apply any statistical test to examine data series this research features the use of multivariate grey models through the genetic algorithm to synthesize forecasts from univariate grey prediction models commonly used in tourism forecasting into composite forecasts Empirical results showed that the proposed GFCM significantly outperformed the other combination methods considered. The  …  results also suggested that the risk of forecast failures caused by selecting an inappropriate single model for tourism demand forecasting can be reduced by using the GFCM.  Show more
