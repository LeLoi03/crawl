  Call for Papers 
  The 20th International Conference on Managed Programming Languages & Runtimes (MPLR’23, formerly ManLang, originally PPPJ) is a premier forum for presenting and discussing novel results in all aspects of managed programming languages and runtime systems, which serve as building blocks for some of the most important computing systems around, ranging from small-scale (embedded and real-time systems) to large-scale (cloud-computing and big-data platforms) and anything in between (mobile, IoT, and wearable applications).  
 Papers accepted by MPLR’23 describe original research results and have not been published anywhere else. Each submitted paper has received a minimum of three reviews by members of the program committee. Papers have been selected based on their originality, relevance, technical clarity, and quality of presentation. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the MPLR’23 symposium and present the paper.

 Call for Papers  
 The 20th International Conference on Managed Programming Languages & Runtimes (MPLR, formerly ManLang, originally PPPJ) is a premier forum for presenting and discussing novel results in all aspects of managed programming languages and runtime systems, which serve as building blocks for some of the most important computing systems in use, ranging from small-scale (embedded and real-time systems) to large-scale (cloud-computing and big-data platforms) and anything in between (desktop, mobile, IoT, and wearable applications).  
 Topics   
 The areas of interest include but are not limited to:  
  Performance analysis and monitoring 
  Compiler and program verification and model checking 
  If you are unsure whether a particular topic falls within the scope of MPLR’22 or if you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to contact the Program Chair (moss at cs dot umass dot edu).  
 Submission Categories   
 MPLR accepts four types of submissions:  
 Regular research papers | , describing novel contributions involving managed language platforms. Research papers will be evaluated based on their relevance, novelty, technical rigor, and contribution to the state-of-the-art. (Format: up to 12 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix); 
  Work-in-progress research papers | , describing hot topics or promising new ideas, with perhaps less maturity than full papers. Work-in-progress papers will be evaluated with an emphasis on novelty and the potential of the new ideas instead of technical rigor and experimental results. (Format: up to 6 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix); 
  Accepted submissions will be published in the ACM Digital Library, except if the authors prefer not to be included.  
 Author Instructions   
 Submissions need to use the ACM SIGPLAN format with the sigplan  style.  
 All submissions need to be in PDF format. MPLR now uses double-blind reviewing  . Authors should not show their names on a submission and should refer to their own work in third person.  We further recommend that they avoid publicizing the work, at least under the same or similar title, while it is under review.  
 Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.  
 Important Dates   
 Paper Submission Deadline: 26 June 2023 | Extended to 29 June 2023 anywhere on Earth 
  Author response period: 25-27 July 2023 
  Paper Author Notification: 31 July 2023 
  Camera Ready for Papers: 1 September 2023 
  Posters and Demos Submission Deadline: 5 September 2023 
  Posters and Demos Notification: 12 September 2023 
  Conference Dates: 22 October 2023 
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.
