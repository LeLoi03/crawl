  News  Info from the Community 
 Five years ago, we had the pleasure of hosting a previous edition of this conference, although the event was moved online due to the global pandemic. Now, we are thrilled to welcome you back in person to Seville, a city renowned for its rich cultural heritage, vibrant atmosphere, and stunning architecture. From the iconic Plaza de Espa√±a to the charming streets of the old town, Seville offers a perfect backdrop for what promises to be an inspiring and enriching event.  
 We look forward to welcoming you to Seville for an unforgettable experience of knowledge exchange, networking, and cultural exploration.  
 Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion  
 The BPM community is committed to the promotion of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in all aspects of our professional activities. We celebrate the diversity in our community and welcome everyone regardless of age, gender identity, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, country of origin, religion, sexual orientation, physical ability, education, and work experience. We encourage all participants to consider DEI in their writing, reviews, presentations, and all interactions related to the BPM conference. The BPM community has a tradition of researching and experimenting with real-world applications and, as such, needs to find the balance between research and societal events that shape our lives as a liberal society that supports DEI principles. Therefore, the conference participants should feel free to express themselves on all topics within and beyond our interests as a research community and to do so in a non-aggravating and respectful manner, being considerate to those who are the possible victims of, a.o., violence, war, or political oppression and making use of this special opportunity to gather in an international setting to better understand multiple view points in a safe and inclusive environment.
