 CALL FOR PAPERS  
 HLPP 2023  
  16 th  International Symposium on International Symposium on  
  High-Level Parallel Programming and Applications   
 Cluj-Napoca, Romania   
  June 29-30, 2023   
  On-site Event   
 At present, popular parallel and distributed programming methodologies are dominated by low-level techniques such as send/receive message passing, or equivalently unstructured shared memory mechanisms.  
 Higher-level, structured approaches offer many possible advantages and have a key role to play in the scalable exploitation of ubiquitous parallelism.  
 HLPP symposia provide a forum for discussion and research about such high-level approaches to parallel and distributed programming.  
 Topics  
 HLPP 2023 invites papers on all topics in high-level parallel programming, its tools and applications including, but not limited to, the following aspects:  
 High-level parallel programming and performance models (e.g. BSP, CGM, LogP, MPM, etc.) and tools 
  Declarative parallel and distributed programming methodologies based on functional, logical, data-flow, actor, and other paradigms 
  Applications of parallel and distributed systems using high-level languages and tools 
  Teaching experience with high-level tools and methods for parallel and distributed computing 
  HLPP Symposia Series  
 Submission  
 Papers submitted to HLPP 2023 must describe original research results and must not have been published or simultaneously submitted anywhere else. As it is traditional for HLPP symposia, the accepted papers will be distributed at the symposium in draft proceedings, and revised papers will be published in a special issue of the International Journal of Parallel Programming.  
 Each paper will receive a minimum of three reviews by members of the international technical program committee. Papers will be selected based on their originality, relevance, technical clarity, and quality of presentation.  
 Manuscripts must be prepared with the Springer IJSS latex macro package using the single column option (\documentclass[smallextended]{svjour3}) and submitted via the EasyChair Conference Management System as one pdf file. The strict page limit for initial submission and camera-ready version is 20 pages in the aforementioned format.  
 At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the HLPP 2023 symposium and present the paper.  
 After the symposium the authors of the papers will have ample time to revise their papers and to incorporate both reviewer feedback and presentation feedback from the whole audience during the symposium.
