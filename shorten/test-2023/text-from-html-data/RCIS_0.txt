 Scope and Topics   
 In the age of connectivity, we experience technological components functioning and communicating in new, expanded ways. Large and interconnected information and communication systems create, aggregate, analyze, communicate, transform and generally process data from various sources to serve a range of applications, services and systems. This spectrum of connectivity enables new opportunities, challenges, issues and risks, which call for investigation and consideration by practitioners, researchers, and other stakeholders. RCIS 2023 will welcome scientists, researchers, engineers and practitioners from a wide range of information science fields and will bring them together to provide opportunities for knowledge sharing and dissemination towards connected information systems and services. Hence, this year, RCIS 2023 has chosen the theme Information Science and the Connected World to be in the center of its reflections and discussions.  
 RCIS welcomes submissions from the whole spectrum of the information science field. The list of themes and topics includes, but is not limited to:  
 A1. Information Systems and their Engineering | A2. User-Oriented Approaches 
  Venue   
 RCIS 2023 will be held in the Corfu, organized by Networks, Multimedia and Security Systems Laboratory (NMSLab) of the Department of the Informatics of the Ionian University.
