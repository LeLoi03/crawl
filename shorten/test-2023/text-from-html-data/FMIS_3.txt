 Reducing the likelihood of faults and failures in the development and in the use of interactive systems becomes a more and more inescapable necessity.: Indeed the use of such systems is becoming widespread in applications that demand high dependability due to usability, safety or, security requirements while taking into account additional considerations such as User Experience or Learnability. Interactive systems make use of more and more sophisticated electronic devices and are made up by multiple hardware and software components. These systems are in fact large artifacts that are also becoming increasingly ubiquitous and being used in new and more complex situations.  
 Consequently, the use of formal methods in providing some assurance on the dependability of interactive systems should take into account the wider socio-technical system. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers in computer science, human factors, and other areas of HCI, from both academia and industry, who are interested in both formal methods and interactive system design and development.
