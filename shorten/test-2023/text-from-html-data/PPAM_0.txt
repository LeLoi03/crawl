  15th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON  
  PARALLEL PROCESSING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS  
 The PPAM 2024 conference is organized by the Department of Computer Science of the Czestochowa University of Technology together with the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and IT4Innovations National Supercomputing Center of the Technical University of Ostrava, in technical cooperation with Poznań Supercomputing and Networking Center, under the patronage of the Committee of Informatics of the Polish Academy of Sciences.  
 This year, the PPAM conference will take place in Ostrava, a city in the northeast of the Czech Republic and the capital of the Moravian-Silesian Region. PPAM2024 will be held from September 8 to September 11, 2024  , at the Technical University of Ostrava, at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.  
   PPAM2024 OVERVIEW  
 The PPAM 2024 conference, fifteenth in a series, will cover topics in parallel and distributed processing, including theory and applications, as well as applied mathematics. The focus will be on models, algorithms, and software tools which facilitate efficient and convenient utilization of modern parallel and distributed computing architectures as well as on large-scale applications. A special attention is expected to be given to the future of computing beyond Moore's Law, and AI/ML approaches in high performance computing.  
 PPAM 2024 is expected to be an in-person conference with the possibility of remote participation. However, we strongly encourage in-person participation, as PPAM also has very compelling networking aspects and a social and cultural program.  
 The organizers will provide shuttles between Krakow airport and conference hotels in Ostrava.
