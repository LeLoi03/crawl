  Abstract  
 The book includes papers about various problems of dependable operation of computer systems and networks, which were presented during the 18th DepCoS-RELCOMEX conference. Their collection can be an interesting source material for scientists, researchers, practitioners, and students who are dealing with design, analysis, and engineering of computer systems and networks and must ensure their dependable operation. The increasing role of artificial intelligence algorithms and tools in modern information technology and computer engineering, especially rapid expansion of tools based on deep learning methods, calls for extending our view on system dependability. Selection of papers in these proceedings not only illustrates a wide-ranging variety of multidisciplinary topics which should be considered in this context but also proves that virtually all areas of contemporary computer systems and networks musttake into account an aspect of dependability.
