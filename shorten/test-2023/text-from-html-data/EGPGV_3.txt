We can define AMR data as a dynamic gridding format of cells hierarchically refined from a computational domain described in this study as a regular Cartesian grid. This adaptive feature is essential for tracking time-dependent evolutionary phenomena and makes the AMR format an essential representation for 3D numerical simulations. However, the visualization of numerical simulation data highlights one critical issue: the significant increases in generated data memory footprint reaching petabytes, thus greatly exceeding the memory capabilities of the most recent graphics hardware. Therefore, the question is how to access this massive data - AMR time series in particular - for interactive visualization on a simple workstation. To overcome this main problem, we present an out-of-core GPU-based architecture. Our proposal is a cache system based on an ad-hoc bricking identified by a Space-Filling Curve (SFC) indexing and managed by a GPU-based page table that loads required AMR data on-the-fly from disk to GPU memory.

Raycasting of camera-aligned billboards is considered the state-of-the-art technique to render large sets of spheres in a rasterization-based pipeline since the approach was first proposed by Gumhold. Over time various acceleration techniques have been proposed, such as the rendering of point primitives as billboards, which are trivial to rasterize and avoid a high workload in the vertex pipeline. Other techniques attempt to optimize data upload and access patterns in shader programs, both relevant aspects for dynamic data. Recent advances in graphics hardware raise the question of whether these optimizations are still valid. We evaluate several rendering and data access scheme combinations on real-world datasets and derive recommendations for efficient rasterization-based sphere rendering.    Show more

Item           Extended Visual Programming for Complex Parallel Pipelines in ParaView  ( The Eurographics Association  ,  2023  ) Petersen, Marvin  ;   Lukasczyk, Jonas  ;   Gueunet, Charles  ;   Chabat, Timothée  ;   Garth, Christoph  ;   Bujack, Roxana  ;   Pugmire, David  ;   Reina, Guido      Show more      Modern visualization software facilitates the creation of visualization pipelines combining a plethora of algorithms to achieve high-fidelity visualization. When the complexity of the pipelines to be created increases, additional techniques are needed to ensure that reasoning about the pipelines structure and its performance remains feasible. This paper presents three additions to ParaView with the goal of improving presentation of complex, parallel pipelines benefiting pipeline realization. More specifically, we provide a runtime performance annotation visualization integrated in a visual programming node editor, allowing all users to reason about basic performance and intuitively manipulate the structure and configuration of pipelines. Further, we extend the list of available filters with control flow filters, supporting for- and while-loops with a comprehensible representation in the node editor. Our extension is based on graphical manipulation of a node graph that expresses the flow of data and computation in a VTK pipeline, and draws upon a long tradition and positive experience with similar interfaces across a wide range of software systems such as the visualization tools SCIRun and VTK Designer, or the rendering systems Blender and Houdini. The extension we provide integrates seamlessly into the existing ParaView architecture as a plug-in, i.e., it does not require any modifications to ParaView itself or VTK's execution model.
