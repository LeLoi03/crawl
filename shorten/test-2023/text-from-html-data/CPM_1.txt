  Submission  
 Submission is through the EasyChair conference system, by using the link below. The submission process requires registration to create an EasyChair account prior to submission.  
 Submission format  
 The authors should submit an extended abstract not exceeding 15 single-spaced pages on A4 (or US letter) paper excluding the title page (containing title, authors, affiliations, e-mail addresses, a short abstract, and keywords) and the references. Please note that 15 pages is an upper bound and shorter submissions are more than welcome. The authors are required to use the LaTeX style file supplied by Dagstuhl (LIPIcs). Papers must be submitted as a single file in PDF format.  
 Additional material intended for the referees but not for publication in the final version – for example details of proofs – may be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page limit. The program code of experimental papers should be made public, with reasonable documentation, such that the PC may evaluate replicability of experimental results.  
 Papers submitted for review should represent original, previously unpublished work and surveys of important results. At the time the extended abstract is submitted to CPM, and for the entire review period, the paper (or essentially the same paper) should not be under review by any other conference with published proceedings or by a scientific journal.  
 At least one author of an accepted paper is expected to present the paper at the conference as a registered participant. We are planning an in-person event, with online presentations in exceptional cases (e.g., authors with difficulties to travel). Should the pandemic situation change, we will move to hybrid or fully online.
