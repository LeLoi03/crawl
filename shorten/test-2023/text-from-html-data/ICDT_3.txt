 CALL FOR PAPERS   
  26th International Conference on Database Theory (ICDT 2023)  
 We are glad to announce that EDBT/ICDT will be back to an in-person  conference and the organizers look forward to welcoming the database community to Ioannina after 3 years of online EDBT/ICDT events.  
  The conference will run in hybrid mode, so that participants having travel restrictions will still have the opportunity to attend.  
 We are now soliciting paper for the SECOND SUBMISSION CYCLE  of ICDT:  
  September 14, 2022 (AoE): Abstract submission deadline  
  September 21, 2022 (AoE): Paper submission deadline  
  November 20, 2022: Notification  
 We welcome research papers on every  topic related to the principles and theory of data management, provided that there is a clear connection to foundational aspects. This includes, for example, articles on "classical" data management topics such as:  
  - theoretical computer science.  
 In all of the above, a clear emphasis on foundational aspects is expected.  
 Additional reasons for submitting to and attending ICDT are the excellent invited speakers  :  
 Seshadhri Comandur: Subgraph counting and graph orientations: the gift that keeps on giving (ICDT Invited Lecture)  
  Leonid Libkin: The Essence of GQL (ICDT/EDBT Keynote)  
  Gonzalo Navarro: Compact Data Structures Meet Databases (ICDT/EDBT Keynote)  
 and high-quality scientific contributions already accepted  in the 1st submission cycle:  
 Sepehr Assadi, Nirmit Joshi, Milind Prabhu and Vihan Shah. Generalizing Greenwald-Khanna: Streaming Quantile Summaries for Weighted Inputs  
  Tamara Cucumides, Juan L. Reutter and Domagoj Vrgoc: Size bounds and algorithms for conjunctive regular path queries  
 Proceedings Chair:   
  Brecht Vandevoort (Hasselt University)  
 Submission Instructions   
 Papers must be written in English and provide sufficient detail to allow the program committee to assess their merits. The results must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere, including the proceedings of other symposia, workshops, and journals.  
 The proceedings will appear under an open access license in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series, based at Schloss Dagstuhl. More specifically, all articles in LIPIcs are published under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) license. Thereby, the authors retain their copyrights and readers can re-use the published work in the most meaningful manner. The proceedings will also appear in Scopus.  
 At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to register at the conference and present the paper.  
 Awards   
  An award will be given to the Best Paper and to the Best Newcomer Paper where `newcomer' refers to the field of database theory. The latter award will preferentially be given to a paper authored only by students and in that case be called Best Student-Paper Award. The program committee reserves the right to not give any award and to split an award among several papers. Papers co-authored by program committee members are not eligible for an award.  
 Detailed list of topics (not exclusive):  ICDT welcomes papers on any topic related to principles of data management such as, for example, data mining, information extraction, information retrieval, database aspects of machine learning, distributed and parallel databases, cloud computing, graph databases, (semantic) Web data, web services, data streams, sketching, data-centric (business) process management and workflows, data and knowledge integration and exchange, data provenance, views, data warehouses, domain-specific databases (multimedia, scientific, spatial, temporal, text), data privacy and security, concurrency, and recovery.
