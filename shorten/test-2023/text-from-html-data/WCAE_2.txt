 Workshop on Computer Architecture Education: Early decision deadline approaching  
 Workshop on Computer  
  a constituent conference of the Federated Computing Research Conference  
  Orlando, FL  
  June 17, 2023   
  Submission deadline, May 22. Submit by May 1 to receive a decision by May 18, the early registration deadline!   
 WCAE provides a forum for educators in computer architecture to discuss  
  and share their experiences and teaching philosophy. Past WCAEs have been held  
  others. The materials submitted should be detailed enough so that  
  other instructors could use them to construct assignments for their own  
  courses, but not detailed enough that someone could re-use a submission to your  
  assignment as a submission to another instructor’s assignment based on your  
  materials.   
 Ideas for nifty assignments should be emailed to the organizer (efg@ncsu.edu) rather than submitted through EasyChair  .
