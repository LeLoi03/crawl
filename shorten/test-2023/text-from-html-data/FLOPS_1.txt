  Call For Papers  
  FLOPS 2024: 17th International Symposium on Functional and Logic Programming  
  ============================================================  
  May 15-17, 2024, Kumamoto, Japan  
  FLOPS aims to bring together practitioners, researchers and implementers  
  of declarative programming, to discuss mutually interesting results and  
  common problems: theoretical advances, their implementations in language  
  scope includes all aspects of the design, semantics, theory,  
  applications, implementations, and teaching of declarative programming.  
  FLOPS specifically aims to promote cross-fertilization between theory  
  and practice and among different styles of declarative programming.  
  *** Scope ***  
  FLOPS solicits original papers in all areas of declarative programming:  
  * functional, logic, functional-logic programming, rewriting systems,  
  case studies.  
  FLOPS promotes cross-fertilization among different styles of declarative  
  programming. Therefore, research papers must be written to be  
  understandable by a wide audience of declarative programmers and  
  researchers. In particular, each submission should explain its  
  contributions in both general and technical terms, clearly identifying  
  what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant for its  
  area, and comparing it with previous work. Submission of system  
  descriptions and declarative pearls are especially encouraged.  
  *** Submission ***  
  Submissions should fall into one of the following categories:  
  must be written in English and can be up to 15 pages excluding  
  references, though system descriptions and pearls are typically shorter.  
  The formatting has to conform to Springerâ€™s LNCS guidelines. FLOPS 2024  
  will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process.  
  The proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS series. We  
  expect to invite the authors of a selection of the best papers to submit  
  an extended version of their FLOPS paper to a special issue which will  
  appear in the journal Science of Computer Programming.  
  All deadlines are Anywhere on Earth (AoE = UTC-12).  
  * Abstract due: Wed 6th Dec 2023  
  * Submission deadline: Wed 13th Dec 2023  
  * Notifications: Wed 31st Jan 2024  
  * Final versions due: Wed 28th Feb 2024  
  *** Organizers ***  
  Naohiko Hoshino Sojo University, JP (Local Chair)  
  *** FLOPS sponsorship ***
