The venue is only a short distance from the Battery Promenade and Waterfront Parks overlooking the Charleston Harbor and Fort Sumter, where the first shots of the Civil War were fired.  
 Finally, numerous renowned golf courses, barrier island beaches, and national parks are only a short drive away.  Come and let us share our southern hospitality!
