 Submission Guidelines  
 The Euromicro Conference Series on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications (SEAA) is a long-standing international forum for researchers, practitioners, and students to present and discuss the latest innovations, trends, experiences, and concerns in the field of Software Engineering and Advanced Applications in information technology for software-intensive systems.  
 SEAA 2023 encourages the submission of full research papers, short papers, tool demo papers (maximum 4 pages), and posters (maximum 2 pages). A maximum of 8 pages is allowed for each full research paper. Papers follow a single-blinded reviewing process and must contain original unpublished work, describe significant novel contributions, and provide evidence about the validation of the results. Reports on industrial applications are also welcome.  
 Papers submitted to SEAA 2023 must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for SEAA 2023. Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases.  
 Conference Publishing Services (CPS) will publish accepted papers in the conference proceedings, and the proceedings will be submitted to the IEEE Xplore digital library and indexing services. We reserve the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., by not placing it in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library) if it is not presented at the conference.   
 Best papers of SEAA 2023 will be invited to submit extended versions for a theme issue at Elsevier Information and Software Technology. Selected papers will be expected to comply with the standard guidelines of the journal when publishing an extended version of a paper, including adding about 30% new material.  
 Papers must strictly adhere to the two-column IEEE conference proceedings format.  
  Please use the available templates  . LaTeX users should use the following configuration: \documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}. Microsoft Word users should use the US Letter format template.
