 Enterprise Modeling: Practices and Perspectives  Brage Johansen    
 This paper presents an overview of various approaches to enterprise modeling, illustrated by present and future applications of enterprise modeling technology. A taxonomy derived from different objectives of enterprise modeling is proposed. Preliminary experiences from a large-scale enterprise modeling and organizational restructuring project are reported. The project was conducted at a natural gas process plant operated by the Norwegian oil company Statoil. We argue that the potential of enterprise modeling in business process improvements only can be utilized when the methodology is brought to the heads and hands of the inhabitants of the enterprise. Finally, a coordination environment denoted “the control room metaphor” is presented as a futuristic view of enterprise model development and application.
