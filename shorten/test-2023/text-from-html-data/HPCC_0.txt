  Introduction  
 With the rapid growth in computing and communications technology, the past decade has witnessed a proliferation of powerful parallel and distributed systems and an ever increasing demand for practice of high performance computing and communications ( HPCC  ). HPCC  has moved into the mainstream of computing and has become a key technology in determining future research and development activities in many academic and industrial branches, especially when the solution of large and complex problems must cope with very tight timing schedules.  
 Among a series of highly successful International Conferences on High Performance Computing and Communications ( HPCC  ), HPCC  conference comes to its 25th edition of a forum for engineers and scientists in academia, industry, and government to address the resulting profound challenges and to present and discuss their new ideas, research results, applications and experience on all aspects of high performance computing and communications. IEEE HPCC  is sponsored by IEEE, IEEE Computer Society, and IEEE  
  Technical Committee on Scalable Computing (TCSC).  
 Scope and Topics  
  22. Autonomic, reliability and fault-tolerance  
  23. Trust, security and privacy  
 Submission Guidelines  
 Publications  
  Accepted and presented papers will be included into the IEEE Conference Proceedings published by IEEE CS Press. Authors of accepted papers, or at least one of them, are requested to register and present their work at the conference, otherwise their papers may be removed from the digital libraries of IEEE CS and EI after the conference.
