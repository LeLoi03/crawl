 Call for Research Papers  
 CSEE&T 2023 seeks original research papers on novel ideas, methods and techniques for software engineering education and training. Contributions may concern all fields of software engineering education and training.  
 Topics of Interest   
 The list below indicates areas of software engineering education and training in CSEE&T 2023. Submissions on other related topics are also welcome.  
 Requirements engineering education (REE) 
  Teaching artificial intelligence (TAI) 
  Software engineering education for novices (SEN) 
  Vision for SE education in the future (VEF) 
  Submission Types   
 Full Research Papers (FRP, 10 pages maximum)   
 Authors are invited to submit papers describing original research in relevant areas of software engineering education and training. Papers presenting actual research results, or in-depth analysis of experience with delivering courses and training units in different settings (schools, universities, industry, governmental entities, etc.), or describing theoretical or empirical research, new techniques and tools, novel interpretation and in-depth case studies, are all welcome. Research papers will be evaluated based on originality, technical quality and relevance to the field of software engineering education. They should clearly relate the work described to the relevant literature and provide an adequate evaluation.  
 Short Papers (SP, 5 pages maximum)   
 Short paper submissions that address software engineering education and training topics are also invited. They are intended particularly for reports of less substantial work, or of work that is still in progress (such as experience with a particular educational tool or support environment), or they may discuss a promising idea at an early stage, or an idea that may lack complete evaluation. Even so, it is important that short papers relate the work described to the relevant literature and attempt to evaluate it as far as possible. Conclusions should focus on aspects interesting for others working in related areas.  
 Format and Submission Procedures   
 CSEE&T 2023 will continue to use the IEEE double column format for its proceedings. All submissions must conform to this format, and must be within the page lengths specified for the class of submission.  
 For research papers, CSEE&T 2023 will feature a double-blind review process. Each paper has to be prepared in accordance with established guidelines for double-blind reviews (i.e. omitting the authors names, referencing own work in the third person, etc.).  
 Submissions that do not adhere to the formatting guidelines, are not blinded by the authors, or do exceed the page limits, will be desk rejected without further review.  
 Acceptance and Presentation   
 Conference content will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore as well as other Abstracting and Indexing (A&I) databases. All accepted submissions are subject to registration and presentation at the conference as a condition for publication.  
 Each paper is evaluated by at least three members of the program committee. After discussion of the paper and the reviews by the program committee the final decision is made. With each accepted paper at least one (co-)author has to register as delegate before the camera ready deadline and present the paper at the conference. Otherwise papers will not be published in the conference proceedings.  
 Oral presentations will take approximately full papers: 20 minutes with additional time of 10 minutes for discussions and short papers: 15 minutes with additional time of 5 minutes for discussions. Detailed information regarding presentation times for each individual paper category will be made upon program creation. Presentations should focus on triggering discussions for the benefit of both, the author(s) and potential adopters of the concept presented.
