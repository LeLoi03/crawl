 ================================================================  
 We invite submissions of novel research articles for a special issue of Discrete Applied Mathematics  on Combinatorial Optimization  .  
 This special issue will be dedicated to the International Symposium on Combinatorial Optimization ISCO 2022 that was held online on May 18â€“20, 2022. However, the special issue is also open to papers that were not presented at the conference. Contributions arising from papers given at the symposium should be substantially extended and should cite the conference paper.  
 High-quality research papers are solicited to address theoretical as well as practical issues of Combinatorial Optimization. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Approximation algorithms 
 The NEW  deadline for submission is FEBRUARY 15, 2023  .  
 Accepted papers will be published online individually, before print publication.
