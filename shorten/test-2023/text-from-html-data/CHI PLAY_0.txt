 The Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play (CHI PLAY) is the international and interdisciplinary conference (by ACM SIGCHI) for researchers and professionals across all areas of play, games and human-computer interaction (HCI). We call this area “player-computer interaction”.

 10-13 October 2023 – Stratford, Canada   
    In 2023, CHI PLAY will be hosted at the Stratford School of Interaction Design and Business  , located in Stratford, Ontario Canada, with a hybrid format.  
 CHI PLAY highlights and fosters discussion of current high-quality research in games and human-computer interaction as a foundation for the future of digital play. To this end, the conference blends streams of academic research papers, interactivities, interactive play demos, a student game design competition, a poster session and industry insights.  
 CHI PLAY grew out of the increasing work around games and play emerging from the ACM annual conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) as well as smaller conferences such as Fun and Games and Gamification. CHI PLAY is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group for Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI). All accepted submissions will be distributed in the CHI PLAY Conference Proceedings available in the ACM Digital Library, where they will remain accessible to thousands of researchers and practitioners worldwide.
