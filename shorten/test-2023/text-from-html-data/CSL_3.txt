 Computer Science Logic (CSL) is the annual conference of the European Association for Computer Science Logic (EACSL)  . It is an interdisciplinary conference, spanning across both basic and application oriented research in mathematical logic and computer science.  
 CSL'23 will be held on February 13 - 16, 2023, in Warsaw, Poland, with satellite workshops on February 17. It is planned as an on-site event, with support for remote presence for those participants who are unable to come for pandemic reasons. Keynote speakers: Claudia Faggian (Université de Paris, France), Nina Gierasimczuk (Danish Technical University, Denmark), Dale Miller (Inria Saclay, France), Michał Pilipczuk Pilipczuk (University of Warsaw, Poland) and Davide Sangiorgi (University of Bologna, Italy).  
 Authors are invited to submit contributed papers of no more than 15 pages in LIPIcs style (not including appendices or references), presenting unpublished work fitting the scope of the conference. Papers may not be submitted concurrently to another conference with refereed proceedings. The PC chairs should be informed of closely related work submitted to a conference or a journal.  
 Submitted papers must be in English and must provide sufficient detail to allow the Programme Committee to assess the merits of the paper. Full proofs may appear in a clearly marked technical appendix which will be read at the reviewers' discretion. Authors are strongly encouraged to include a well written introduction which is directed at all members of the PC. The paper should be submitted via Easychair  .
