 Welcome Message     
 I am pleased to welcome each and every one of you to the IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC) in the exciting city of Las Vegas. For several of us in the organizing side as well as the many researchers, developers, and practitioners from academia and industry who are attending this year, it is a first step back to normalcy- IEEE CCNC this year will be conducted in person! We are excited at the possibilities of the planned and casual intellectual conversations along the hallways, scribbles made in the coffee-breaks, professional networking during the social events, and most importantly, establishing meaningful person-to-person interactions after a long hiatus. Indeed, this year we have the largest number of registered attendees over the past decade and two exciting live keynotes from industry and academic leaders. The message is clear that the research community is resilient and looking forward to engaging in person!  
 Running a large conference like IEEE CCNC with several main tracks, work in progress (WIP), posters, demos, workshops is a mammoth task. For this, I would like to acknowledge primarily the incredible leadership of Prof. Bang Chul Jung (TPC Chair) who was aided in no small part by Prof. Silvia Mirri (TPC Vice Chair). A conference as large as this can only work if the submission/decision system (EDAS) is managed effectively. Many thanks to Prof. Zhanghyu Guan for being patient with our random requests at all the odd hours over the past eight months or so! Alongside the main tracks, we are pleased to present five workshops, which will allow more intimate discussions on specialized topics. For their role in selecting and shepherding the workshops, I must thank Prof. Thorsten Herfet and Prof. Won-Yong Shin. We have had off-the-charts interest in our poster-and-demo tracks this year. These tracks offer early exposure and feedback from the community, and many presenters return back the following year with main track submissions. Let me commend Demo Chairs Prof. Frank den Hartog and Dr. Ravikumar Balakrishnan, as well as Poster Chairs Profs. Jeongho Kwak and Kazuki Maruta, for handling this very large load so efficiently!  
 Beyond technical sessions alone, we hope that IEEE CCNC will be the forum for discussions and debate on topics like industry trends and the role of machine learning in wireless. These are indeed the areas that two panels will dive into, organized by Dr. Arjun Anand and Prof. Dola Saha, respectively. There will be plenty of opportunities to learn new skills and find new tools for research in the set of twelve tutorials selected by the Tutorial Chairs Profs. Ranga Rao Venkatesha Prasad and Tony Quek. If you read of IEEE CCNC through flyers, posts, emails and advertisements, these are directly due to the dedicated efforts of our Publicity Chairs Dr. Debashri Roy and Profs. Howon Lee and Gokhan Secinti. Also a shout out to our Awards Chair Prof. Claudio Casetti, Web Chair Mr. Ki-Hun Lee, Student Grant Chair: Dr. Alexander Gelman, and Publications Chair Mr. Luca Sciullo for serving in these capacities.  
 In closing, I would like to thank all our external patrons for supporting advanced research in the areas of consumer communications and networking. My sincere thanks also to the continuous guidance from the CCNC steering committee, including Dr. Alan Kaplan and Doug Zuckerman, and of course, to Ms. Melissa Torres from the IEEE who magically solves a lot of the complex logistics problems from the start to the end of the planning process!

 Oral Presentation Instructions     
 Papers are allocated 20 minutes each for presentations and questions. Please properly set in EDAS the name of the author who will present the work. The presenter is kindly asked to bring the Session Chair a short bio so that she/he can properly introduce him/her.  
 No PC will be available at the conference   , so please, bring your portable computer with a VGA adaptor if required, or at least bring a copy of your presentation in a USB pen.   
 IMPORTANT  : To be published in the IEEE CCNC 2023 Conference Proceedings and to be eligible for publication in IEEE Xplore®, the paper must be presented by an author of that paper at the conference unless the TPC Chair grants permission for a substitute presenter in advance of the event and who is qualified both to present and answer questions.  
 Demonstration Presentation Instructions     
 Each poster will be provided with enough space on a whiteboard to hold a Vertical/Portrait poster.  
 Presenters must set up posters before their poster sessions (Jan. 9, 2023/Mon or Jan.10, 2023/Tue).  
  The posters must be removed after the session ends.  
 The detailed program of the poster sessions is here  .  
 Welcome to IEEE CCNC 2023!     
 IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference, sponsored by IEEE Communications Society, is a major annual international conference organized with the objective of bringing together researchers, developers, and practitioners from academia and industry working in all areas of consumer communications and networking.  
 IEEE CCNC was organized specifically to help the consumer electronics industry drive the advancement of the numerous wireless and wireline communications technologies that will one day provide on-demand access to both entertainment and information anytime, anywhere, regardless of time or location. This includes a detailed analysis of nearly every technological area ranging from cognitive and peer-to-peer networking to the designer services and tools used to ensure ease-of-use, security and stunning interactivity.  
 IEEE CCNC 2023 will present the latest developments and technical solutions in the areas of home networking, consumer networking, enabling technologies (such as middleware) and novel applications and services. The conference will include a peer-reviewed program of technical sessions, special sessions, business application sessions, tutorials, and demonstration sessions.
