 Welcome to IFIP SEC 2023!  
 The IFIP SEC conferences aim to bring together primarily researchers, but also practitioners from academia, industry and governmental institutions to elaborate and discuss IT Security and Privacy Challenges that we are facing today and will be facing in the future. We seek submissions from academia, industry, and government presenting novel research on all theoretical and practical aspects of security and privacy protection in ICT Systems.  
 IFIP SEC 2023 will take place during 14 â€“ 16 June 2023 and will be organized by the Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center (PSNC) in Poznan, Poland.  
 The conference is planned in a hybrid mode.
