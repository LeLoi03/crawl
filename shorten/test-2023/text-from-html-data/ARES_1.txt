 About ARES 03/04   
 ARES annually transforms European cities into knowledge exchange hubs, spotlighting dependability's critical facets—availability, reliability, and security. Our conference serves as a forum for in-depth discussions on dependability, covering safety, confidentiality, integrity, maintainability, and security across diverse applications.  
  Complementing these initiatives, ARES steadfastly supports workshops held alongside the conference. Many have become integral to the ARES family, contributing to our vibrant community. In 2023, ARES hosted 14 regular workshops and 8 EU Project workshops, further enriching our commitment to advancing IT security, reliability, and collaborative exploration. Join us at ARES, where ideas converge, partnerships form, and the future of Dependable Computing unfolds.
