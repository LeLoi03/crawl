  Call for Papers  
  ICPP2023 will be held in Salt Lake City, UTAH, USA, from August 7th to 10th, 2023  . ICPP 2023 is a premier venue for presenting the latest research on all aspects of parallel processing. Topics of interest in ICPP 2023 papers include, but are not limited to:  
 Algorithms: | Parallel and Distributed Algorithms, Parallel and Distributed Combinatorial & Numerical Methods, Scheduling Algorithms for Parallel and Distributed Applications and Platforms, Algorithmic Innovations for Parallel and Distributed Machine Learning. 
  Applications: | Parallel and Distributed Applications, Scalable Data Analytics & Applied Machine Learning, Computational and Data-Driven Science & Engineering (e.g., Astrophysics, Computational Chemistry, Bioinformatics, Climate Science, Finance, Geology). 
  Software: | Systems Software, Middleware, Runtime Systems, Parallel and Distributed Programming Languages & Models, Programming Systems, Compilers, Libraries, Programming Infrastructures and Tools, Operating and Real-Time Systems. 
  Submission Guidelines  
  The review process is double-anonymous  , so submissions should not  reveal the identity of the authors. Authors should leave out author names, aﬃliations, and (any) acknowledgment from the body of their submission. They should also ensure that any references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person  (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). The purpose of this process is to help the Program Committee and external reviewers come to a judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Authors with further questions about double-anonymous reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chairs by email.  
  The ICPP 2023 technical program includes a reproducibility initiative  , where the submitters will be given an option to submit details about the artifacts that enable their experiments to be reproduced. A reproducibility submission consists of the description of the computational artifacts (up to two pages appendix) and persistent and permanent links to the computational artifacts submission ( more information regarding the ICPP reproducibility initiative here  ). The submission of the reproducibility artifacts will be voluntary, but their presence will be an advantage during the decision process compared to submissions with equivalent ratings without artifacts. We also plan to have rebuttals  only for papers that do not have a clear accept or reject decision."  
  All accepted papers that are presented at the conference will be published in the ACM Digital Library. Accepted papers will also need to follow the conference registration policy to be included in the conference proceedings. We will oﬀer rejected papers an opportunity to be forwarded to workshop organizers to be considered in one of the workshops if the authors choose to do so.

 Please Note  
 We expect at least one author of an accepted paper to attend the conference. The expectation of attendance is implicit in submitting a paper to a conference, rather than a journal, and brings ethical responsibilities to participate actively in the conference (talking to other attendees, presenting the paper, and attending conference sessions). 
  Consequently, it is expected that all accepted papers will be presented in person, unless clear and extenuating circumstances prevent attendance. 
  As an author of an accepted paper, this means you should exhaust all efforts for at least one of you to attend, including seeking a visa (where needed). 
  Any allowance for remote presentation will be considered only after clear evidence that attendance is impossible. 
  These decisions about remote presentation will be made two weeks before the conference begins. 
  A registration fee is required for all accepted papers, regardless of attendance.
