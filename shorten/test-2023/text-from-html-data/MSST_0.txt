 Large Scale File/Storage System Indexing with the Grand Unified File Index ( Presentation  )   
 Jason Lee, Dominic Manno, Gary Grider, LANL   
 As filesystems become larger and larger, management of the data stored in these filesystems becomes more and more complex and time consuming. Querying filesystem metadata with standard tools can take hours or even days due to the sheer amount of metadata to be processed and how standard tools go about processing the metadata. Some filesystems provide custom tools that assist in querying their metadata, but there is no unified set of tools to do so. Additionally, such tools are usually reserved for administrators, not users. The Grand Unified File Index (GUFI) solves all these issues and more. GUFI provides a set of highly performant, parallel tools that allow for complex queries to be applied to the metadata of arbitrary filesystems. The GUFI toolset can be used by both administrators as well as users without violating permission semantics. Indices from disconnected filesystems can be combined, allowing for queries across multiple filesystems at once. This session will provide a high-level overview of GUFI as well as a tutorial on using GUFI.
