 After over 10 years of research, process mining has shown to be a rapidly growing discipline. This is testified by an established research community, publications in top conference and journals, over 30 commercial process mining vendors, and the thousands of organizations already applying process mining.  
 Thought leaders working on process mining will be present, as well as the leading businesses and vendors in process mining that support the conference. At the same time, the conference is neutral, and provides insights that are tool-independent. It features a diversified program, including exciting scientific talks, tool demonstrations, contests, and awards. Workshops on emerging topics and an industry day of excellent speakers complement the program.
