 Developing Efficient Scientific Gateways for Supercomputer Environments Supported by Deep Learning Models  
 Speaker  : Prof. Carla Osthoff (LNCC)  
 The scientific gateway BioinfoPortal for bioinformatics applications is hosted in the National Laboratory for Scientific Computing (LNCC) and is coupled to the Santos Dumont (SDumont) supercomputer environment. BioinfoPortal offers a catalog of bioinformatics computational software that benefits from the parallel and distributed architecture offered by LNCC. Task submissions consume SDumont nodes shared by other supercomputer users; then, it is required to set the best configuration, defined by the best choice of the number of threads/nodes, to be allocated for every task submission. This talk presents research analysis using Deep Neural Networks to estimate the computational time required to execute bioinformatics software in several scenarios using a pre-configured number of nodes and threads. We aim to demonstrate the computational behavior of software in Bioinfoportal and which computational scenario can be chosen to execute software in SDumont efficiently. Results support that the neural networks can predict the most representative variable and identify the configuration with the lowest computational time. This way, BioinforPortal consuming time can lead to an efficient and green gateway, increasing Santos Dumont Supercomputing execution job throughput and decreasing job execution queue waiting time.

 Machine Learning (ML) area have evolved in the last years due to the development of High Performance Computing (HPC). On the other hand, we also have seen many works for evolving HPC through ML. In this context, we could ask: If the community needs HPC to make huge ML-based models more effective, but this same community also needs ML to empower HPC, which area starts this run? Are they exclusive or can we consider both initiatives? This panel aims to discuss this chicken-egg dilemma.
