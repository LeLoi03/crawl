 General Information  
 DCOSS-IoT 2023  
  Coral Bay, Pafos, Cyprus   
    June 19-21, 2023   
 DCOSS-IoT has always been technically co-sponsored by IEEE Computer Society and IEEE Technical Committee on Parallel Processing (TCPP).   
  The 19 th  Annual International Conference on Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things (DCOSS-IoT 2023) will take place in Cyprus, at the Coral Bay near the city of Pafos.  
 The conference intended since its creation to cover several aspects of distributed computing in smartsystems such as high level abstractions and models, systematic design methodologies, signal and information processing, algorithms, analysis and applications. Starting from the 2023 event, DCOSS is broadening its scope beyond sensor networks to smart systems in general as well as the Internet of Things (IoT). The updated name is “Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things” (DCOSS-IoT).
