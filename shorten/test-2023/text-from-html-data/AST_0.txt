  The 4th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Automation of Software Test (AST 2023)   
 Software pervasiveness in both industry and digital society, as well as the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are continuously leading to emerging needs from both software producers and consumers. Infrastructures, software components, and applications aim to hide their increasing complexity in order to appear more human-centric. However, the potential risk from design errors, poor integrations, and time-consuming engineering phases can result in unreliable solutions that can barely meet their intended objectives. In this context, Software Engineering processes keep demanding for the investigation of novel and further refined approaches to Software Quality Assurance (SQA). Software testing automation is a discipline that has produced noteworthy research in the last decade. The search for solutions to automatically test any concept of software is critical, and it encompasses several areas: from the generation of the test cases, test oracles, test stubs/mocks; through the definition of selection and prioritization criteria; up to the engineering of infrastructures governing the execution of testing sessions locally or remotely in the cloud.  
 Authors of the best papers presented at AST 2023 will be invited to submit an extension of their work for possible inclusion in a special issue in Software Testing, Verification, and Reliability (STVR) journal.

 Presentation Instructions  
 Submission  
 Three types of submissions are invited for both research and industry:  
 1. Regular Papers (up to 10 pages plus 2 additional pages of references)   
 Research Paper 
  Industrial Case Study 
  2. Short Papers (up to 4 pages plus 1 additional page of references)   
 Research Paper 
  Industrial Case Study 
  Doctoral Student Research 
  3. Industrial Abstracts (up to 2 pages for all materials)   
 Instructions:  Regular papers include both Research papers that present research in the area of software test automation, and Industrial Case Studies that report on practical applications of test automation. Regular papers must not exceed 10 pages for all materials (including the main text, appendices, figures, tables) plus 2 additional pages of references.  
 Short papers also include both Research papers and Industrial Case Studies. Short papers must not exceed 4 pages plus 1 additional page of references. As short papers, doctoral students working on software testing are encouraged to submit their work. AST will have an independent session to bring doctoral students working on software testing, with experts assigned to each paper together, to discuss their research in a constructive and international atmosphere, and to prepare for the defense exam. The first author in a submission must be the doctoral student and the second author the advisor. Authors of selected submissions will be invited to make a brief presentation followed by a constructive discussion in a session dedicated to doctoral students.  
 Industrial abstract talks are specifically conceived to promote industrial participation: We require the first author of such papers to come from industry. Authors of accepted papers get invited to give a talk with the same time length and within the same sessions as regular papers. Industrial abstracts must not exceed 2 pages for all materials.  
 All submissions must adhere to the following requirements:  
 The page limit is strict (10 pages plus 2 additional pages of references for full papers; 4 pages plus 1 additional page of references for short papers; 2 pages for all materials in case of industrial abstracts). It will not be possible to purchase additional pages at any point in the process (including after acceptance). 
  Submissions must strictly conform to the | IEEE formatting instructions | . All submissions must be in PDF. 
  Submissions must be unpublished original work and should not be under review or submitted elsewhere while being under consideration. AST 2023 will follow the single-blind review process. In addition, by submitting to AST, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the | ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism | and the | IEEE Plagiarism FAQ | . The authors also acknowledge that they conform to the | authorship policy of the ACM | and the | authorship policy of the IEEE | . 
  The accepted regular and short papers, case studies, and industrial abstracts will be published in the ICSE 2023 Co-located Event Proceedings and included in the IEEE and ACM Digital Libraries. Authors of accepted papers are required to register and present their accepted paper at the conference in order for the paper to be included in the proceedings and the Digital Libraries.  
 The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM or IEEE Digital Libraries.  
 This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of ICSE 2023. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 Keynotes  
 Keynote 1: Lessons from 10 Years of Automated Debugging Research   
 Track  AST 2023 (Keynotes)    
 Abstract  The last decade or so has seen dramatic developments in automated debugging, including fault localisation and automated program repair. This talk will look back at 10 years of my experience from working on automated debugging, starting from evolving Spectrum Based Fault Localisation, culminating to the latest work on failure reproduction using Large Language Models. We will look at how serendipitous encounters led to new ideas, how getting slightly outside your comfort zone can help you, and how best we can collaborate with industry in order to transfer our research.  
  Keynote 2: Automatic for the People   
 Track  AST 2023 (Keynotes)    
 Abstract  Software testing is one of the key activities to achieve software quality in practice. To that end, both researchers and tool builders have made considerable efforts to make software testing more efficient and more effective. We have the tools, but where do we put our money? In other words, what do we know about software engineers or software testers that actually write and execute tests? What stimulates them, what blocks them, and what do they need from tools, documentation, production code, or their team?
