  Abstract    
 We study the Solo-Chess problem which has been introduced in [Aravind et al., FUN 2022]. This is a single-player variant of chess in which the player must clear all but one piece from the board via a sequence captures while ensuring that the number of captures performed by each piece does not exceed the piece’s budget. The time complexity of finding a winning sequence of captures has already been pinpointed for several combination of piece types and initial budgets. We contribute to a better understanding of the computational landscape of Solo-Chess by closing two problems left open in [Aravind et al., FUN 2022]. Namely, we show that Solo-Chess is hard even when all pieces are restricted to be only rooks with budget exactly 2, or only knights with budget exactly 11.

  Abstract    
 Ring signatures allow members of a group (called ring) to sign a message anonymously within the group, which is chosen ad hoc at the time of signing (the members do not need to have interacted before). In this paper, we propose a physical version of ring signatures. Our signature is based on one-out-of-many signatures, a method used in many real cryptographic ring signatures. It consists of boxes containing coins locked with padlocks that can only be opened by a particular group member. To sign a message, a group member shakes the boxes of the other members of the group so that the coins are in a random state ("heads" or "tails", corresponding to bits 0 and 1), and opens their box to arrange the coins so that the exclusive "or" of the coins corresponds to the bits of the message they wish to sign. We present a prototype that can be used with coins, or with dice for messages encoded in larger (non-binary) alphabets. We suggest that this system can be used to explain ring signatures to the general public in a fun way. Finally, we propose a semi-formal analysis of the security of our signature based on real cryptographic security proofs.

  Abstract    
 In this paper, we address a natural question at the intersection of combinatorial game theory and computational complexity: "Can a sum of simple tepid games in canonical form be intractable?" To resolve this fundamental question, we consider superstars, positions first introduced in Winning Ways where all options are nimbers. Extending Morris' classic result with hot games to tepid games, we prove that disjunctive sums of superstars are intractable to solve. This is striking as sums of nimbers can be computed in linear time. Our analyses also lead to a family of elegant board games with intriguing complexity, for which we present web-playable versions of the rulesets described within.

  Abstract    
 We show that several pen-and-paper puzzles are NP-complete by giving polynomial-time reductions from the Hamiltonian path and Hamiltonian cycle problems on grid graphs with maximum degree 3. The puzzles include Dotchi Loop, Chains, Linesweeper, Arukone{}₃ (also called Numberlink₃), and Araf. In addition, we show that this type of proof can still be used to prove the NP-completeness of Dotchi Loop even when the available puzzle instances are heavily restricted. Together, these results suggest that this approach holds promise in general for finding NP-completeness proofs of many pen-and-paper puzzles.

  Abstract    
 Card-based cryptography studies the problem of implementing cryptographic algorithms in a visual way using physical cards to demonstrate their security properties for those who are unfamiliar with cryptography. In this paper, we initiate the study of card-based implementations of differentially private mechanisms, which are a standard privacy-enhancing technique to publish statistics of databases while protecting the privacy of any particular individual. We start with giving the definition of differential privacy of card-based protocols. As a feasibility result, we present three kinds of protocols using standard binary cards for computing the sum of parties' binary inputs, f(x₁,…,x_n) = ∑ⁿ_{i=1} x_i for x_i ∈ {0,1}, under differential privacy. Our first protocol follows the framework of output perturbation, which provides differential privacy by adding noise to exact aggregation results. The protocol needs only two shuffles, and the overheads in the number of cards and the error bound are independent of the number n of parties. Our second and third protocols are based on Randomized Response, which adds noise to each input before aggregation. Compared to the first protocol, they improve the overheads in the number of cards and the error bound in terms of differential privacy parameters at the cost of incurring a multiplicative factor of n. To address a technical challenge of generating non-uniform noise using a finite number of cards, we propose a novel differentially private mechanism based on the hypergeometric distribution, which we believe may be of independent interest beyond applications to card-based cryptography.

  Abstract    
 The celebrated Floyd-Warshall algorithm efficiently computes the all-pairs shortest path, and its simplicity made it a staple in computer science classes. Frequently, students discover a variant of this Floyd-Warshall algorithm by mixing up the loop order, ending up with the incorrect APSP matrix. This paper considers a computational problem of computing this incorrect APSP matrix. We will propose efficient algorithms for this problem and prove that this incorrect variant is APSP-complete.

  Abstract    
 Elo rating systems measure the approximate skill of each competitor in a game or sport. A competitor’s rating increases when they win and decreases when they lose. Increasing one’s rating can be difficult work; one must hone their skills and consistently beat the competition. Alternatively, with enough money you can rig the outcome of games to boost your rating. This paper poses a natural question for Elo rating systems: say you manage to get together n people (including yourself) and acquire enough money to rig k games. How high can you get your rating, asymptotically in k? In this setting, the people you gathered aren't very interested in the game, and will only play if you pay them to. This paper resolves the question for n = 2 up to constant additive error, and provides close upper and lower bounds for all other n, including for n growing arbitrarily with k. There is a phase transition at n = k^{1/3}: there is a huge increase in the highest possible Elo rating from n = 2 to n = k^{1/3}, but (depending on the particular Elo system used) little-to-no increase for any higher n. Past the transition point n > k^{1/3}, the highest possible Elo is at least Θ(k^{1/3}). The corresponding upper bound depends on the particular system used, but for the standard Elo system, is Θ(k^{1/3}log(k)^{1/3}).
