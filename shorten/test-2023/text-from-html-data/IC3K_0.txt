 IC3K 2023 will be held in conjunction with WEBIST 2023    , IN4PL 2023    and IJCCI 2023    .   
  Registration to IC3K allows free access to the WEBIST, IN4PL and IJCCI conferences (as a non-speaker).  
 The purpose of the IC3K is to bring together researchers, engineers and practitioners on the areas of Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management. IC3K is composed of three co-located conferences, each specialized in at least one of the aforementioned main knowledge areas.  
  Although the conference is back to the normal mode (i.e., in-person) speakers are allowed to present remotely if unable to travel to the venue (hybrid support).
