 CSR is an annual conference that intends to reflect the broad scope of inter- national cooperation in computer science. The topics covered vary from year to year, but in general try to cover as much of the contemporary computer science as possible. They include, but are not limited to:  
 algorithms and data structures 
  combinatorial optimization 
  Ronitt Rubinfeld (MIT) Marc Zeitoun (Bordeaux)  
  Submission and publication  Authors are invited to submit papers presenting original research in the conference topics, in electronic form (pdf format) via Easy- Chair.  
  Submissions must be unpublished, not under review for publication elsewhere, and provide sufficient information to judge their merits.  
  Submissions must be in English, and not exceed 12 pages, including the title page, in Springer’s LNCS LaTeX style (instructions available here). Additional material, to be read at the discretion of reviewers and PC members, may be provided in a clearly marked appendix or by reference to a manuscript on a web site.  
  For an accepted paper to be included in the proceedings, one of the authors must commit to presenting the paper at the conference.  
  Additionally, selected papers will be invited to a special issue of Theory of Computing Systems and will be refereed according to the journal’s procedure.  
  Yandex Awards  for the best paper and for the best student paper will be awarded by the PC.
