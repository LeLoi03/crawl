 Description   
 The purpose of the “USAM” workshop is to enhance discussions on the criteria and applications, methodologies and tools useful for identifying, evaluating, planning and designing inclusive, diverse and accessibility for all. Universal accessibility or ‘access for all’ is a key component of achieving sustainable development. Conventional transport and land use planning seek an improvement of accessibility without directly serving the real needs of individuals and groups. This leads to issues of transport disadvantage and mobility inequality that translates to lack of access or ability to access key functions and hampering development of social opportunities. These inequalities can manifest in fundamental forms such as lack of access to employment, education or services. Inequalities can also be more insidious such as perceived lack of safety by certain user groups due to their socio-demographic characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity and income levels) that prevent them from accessing parts of their cities and regions.  
 As transport networks have become increasingly complex and dynamic, intermodality and users specific schemes and policies are needed. The concept of universal accessibility is important for the realisation of urban space that is legitimate, vital and serves a wider demographic. This supports the realisation of Sustainable Development Goals 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and 5 (Gender equality). The workshop welcomes all interpretations of universal accessibility from exploration of the physical infrastructure, psychological and cognitive accessibility and perceive and real safety of diverse user groups. The latest generation ITS technologies, such as innovative flexible services and real-time users’ information, Internet of Things, augmented reality, virtual reality and smart roads offers new paths of explorations. The widespread availability of user information and data is also another aspect to for further explorations.  
 Focusing on inclusive, diverse and universal accessibility, this workshop invites critical exploration (but not limited to) the following issues:  
 Keywords  : Accessibility, Mobilities, Safety, Urban space, Cities, Augmented reality, Virtual reality, Accessibility design, Cultural tourism accessibility, ITS, Innovative flexible services, Real-time information, Big-data.  
 Each paper will be independently reviewed by 3 programme committee members. Their individual scores will be evaluated by a small sub-committee and result in one of the following final decisions: accepted, or accepted on the condition that suggestions for improvement will be incorporated, or rejected. Notification of this decision will take place on May 2023.  
  Individuals and groups should submit complete papers (12 to 18 pages).
