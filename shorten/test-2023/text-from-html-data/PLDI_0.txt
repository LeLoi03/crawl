 PLDI 2023  
 PLDI echoes FCRC  ’s statement regarding recent legislation in Florida. Anyone, from any background, should feel encouraged to participate and contribute to PLDI. Differences – in age, race, gender and sexual orientation, nationality, physical ability, thinking style and experience – bring richness to our efforts in providing quality programs and services for the global computing community. Thus, PLDI is committed to creating an environment that welcomes new ideas and perspectives, and where hostility or other antisocial behaviors are not tolerated.   
 PLDI is the premier forum in the field of programming languages and programming systems research, covering the areas of design, implementation, theory, applications, and performance.  
 PLDI’23 will held in-person as part of FCRC’23  , sharing the venue and activities with ten other top computer science conferences.
