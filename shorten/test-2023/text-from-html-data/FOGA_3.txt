  August 30 to September 1, 2023 – Potsdam, Germany  
  All dates of FOGA 2023 concerning the submission and reviewing process have been extended by a week (see also below).  
  We invite you to submit your high-quality articles to the seventeenth conference on the foundations of genetic algorithms (FOGA). The FOGA series aims at advancing our understanding of the working principles behind evolutionary algorithms and related randomized search heuristics, such as local search algorithms, differential evolution, ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, artificial immune systems, simulated annealing, and other Monte Carlo methods for search and optimization. Connections to related areas, such as Bayesian optimization and direct search, are of interest as well.
