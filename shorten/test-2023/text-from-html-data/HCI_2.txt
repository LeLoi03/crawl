  Introduction  
 The British HCI Conference again attracted papers on a wide and interesting range of topics in HCI from ones of long standing importance in the field, such as evaluating interfaces (for example, the paper by Theodor Fahlén, Taufik Akbar Sitompul and Rikard Lindell on Evaluating Graphical User Interfaces for Handling Latency in Remote Crane Operation  ) to topics which have only recently come to the fore (for example the paper by Freya Smith, Malak Sadek and Céline Mougenot on Empowering End-users in Co-Designing AI  ). In addition, although this is the British HCI Conference, it also brought together papers from a range of other countries including China, Iceland, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA.
