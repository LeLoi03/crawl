 RE23 Participants  
 Requirements Engineering 2023 is over  
 Welcome to the website of the 31st IEEE International Requirements Engineering 2023 conference  . The IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference is the premier requirements engineering conference, where researchers, practitioners, students and educators meet, present and discuss the most recent innovations, trends, experiences and issues in the field of requirements engineering. The 31st edition of RE (RE’23) was hosted at Leibniz Universität Hannover in Germany, from September 4-8, 2023.  
 We enjoyed a fully onsite event in Hannover, Germany, where we met after three years of online conferences.  
 Thank you!   
 We thank all participants, authors, and all others who contributed to the success of the conference. You made this week a highlight in the RE year.
