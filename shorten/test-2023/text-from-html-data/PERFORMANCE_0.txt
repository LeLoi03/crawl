 CONFERENCE REGISTRATION IS OPEN   (The conference will be held at Wieboldt Hall  in Northwestern University's downtown campus)   
 Main conference   
 The IFIP PERFORMANCE 2023 conference solicits research papers on the design of algorithms, mathematical modeling, simulation and measurement techniques for computer systems or communication networks. We specifically also invite papers reproducing prior results in these areas, when adding to the reproducibility or applicability of the result.   
 Specific topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following.  
 Performance-oriented methodologies including:   
 Analytical modelling techniques and model validation 
  Anomaly detection, problem diagnosis and troubleshooting 
  Game theory, network economics, and platform design 
  Machine learning, data mining, graph analysis, optimization 
  Performance, scalability, power and reliability analysis 
  Stochastic modelling, statistical analysis and simulation 
  Sustainability analysis and power management 
  Complex networks, sorting and ranking 
  System measurement, performance monitoring and forecasting 
  Workload characterization and benchmarking 
  Evaluation techniques, and algorithms for:   
  Cyber-physical systems, internet of things, and smart grids 
  Data centres, content delivery, cloud computing and virtualization 
  High performance computing 
  Internet and web services 
  Mobile and personal computing systems
