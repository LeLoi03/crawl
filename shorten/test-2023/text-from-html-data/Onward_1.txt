  Citation: This paper revitalized the study of live programming, introducing mechanisms that are now standard techniques in the field. The paper epitomizes the spirit of Onward!, asking risky questions outside the current discourse. In its form the paper was a breath of fresh air, enlivened by the use of comic strips. The work marked the beginning of a rich seam of research that has been productively mined at the ongoing LIVE workshop series at SPLASH.
