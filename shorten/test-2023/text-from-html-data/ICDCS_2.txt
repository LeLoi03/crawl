  Paper Submission   
 The full paper review process is double-blind. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submission must not include author information and must not include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent. While authors can upload their paper to institutional or other preprint repositories such as arXiv.org before reviewing is complete, we generally discourage this since it places anonymity at risk. If authors decide to upload their paper to a preprint site, they must do so at the latest 15 days before the conference abstract submission date. Authors must change the title and abstract of their submission to ICDCS so that it is not immediately obvious they are the same.  
 If your submission is accepted for publication, up to 2 over length pages may be purchased for the final camera-ready version. Each accepted paper must have at least one author registered and be presented during the conference. No-show paper will be reported to the publisher and removed from the conference publication. For authors with multiple papers accepted by the conference, a separate author registration is required for each paper.
