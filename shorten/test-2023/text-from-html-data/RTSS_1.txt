 Scope of the Conference   
 RTSS’23 welcomes submissions of high-quality, original research papers related to both real-time systems theory and practice. Manuscripts may be submitted to either the real-time systems track ( Track 1  ) or the design and applications track ( Track 2  ), which covers Cyber-Physical Systems, HW-SW integration and system-level design, and Internet of Things (IoT). To be in scope, ALL submissions must address some form of real-time requirements such as deadlines, response times or delay/latency.  RTSS especially welcomes new and emerging topics provided that they address some aspects of real-time requirements as stated above. Such topics may include machine learning techniques for the design and analysis of real-time systems, system design approaches for achieving real-time machine learning, resource management in autonomous systems, system-level solutions for real-time applications exploiting domain-specific accelerators, etc.  
 Track 1: Real-Time Systems Track   
 The objective of this track is to promote cutting-edge research in real-time systems, especially new and emerging topics. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to, the following: operating systems, networks, middleware, compilers, tools, scheduling, QoS support, resource management, testing and debugging, design and verification, modeling, WCET analysis, performance analysis, fault tolerance, security, and system experimentation and deployment experiences.  
 Internet of Things (IoT)  
 Grand challenges in IoT include extremely constrained resources (energy supply, storage and computational power) in IoT devices, unprecedented scalability requirements as well as uncertain dynamics in their operating environments. Submissions that build on solid theoretical foundations, present empirical development, and experimental evaluations for empowering IoT applications with real-time requirements are welcome.  
  Paper Submissions   
 Submitted papers must describe original work not previously published or concurrently submitted elsewhere. Papers based on previous work presented at workshops are eligible for submission – if the workshop paper has a digital object identifier (DOI) then the submission must contain at least 30% new material. All submitted papers must comply with the double-blind submission requirements. The main body of each submitted paper is limited to 11 pages of technical content with additional pages permitted for bibliography only. Submissions must be formatted according to IEEE conference paper guidelines.
