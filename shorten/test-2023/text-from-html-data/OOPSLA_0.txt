 Call for Papers  
 The OOPSLA issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (PACMPL) welcomes papers focusing on all practical and theoretical investigations of programming languages, systems and environments. Papers may target any stage of software development, including requirements, modeling, prototyping, design, implementation, generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance, and reuse of software systems. Contributions may include the development of new tools, techniques, principles, and evaluations.  
 OOPSLA 2023 will have two | separate | rounds of reviewing, with | Round 1 submission deadline: October 28, 2022 and and Round 2 submission deadline: April 14, 2023 
  In each round, papers will have a final outcome of Accept, Revise, or Reject—see Review Process for details. 
 Review Process   
 PACMPL(OOPSLA) has two rounds  of reviewing. The final outcome of each round can be one of Accept, Revise or Reject.  
 Each round  of reviewing consists of two phases  . The first phase evaluates the papers and results in an early notification of Reject, Revise, or Conditional Accept. During the first phase, authors will be able to read their reviews and respond to them. The second phase is restricted to conditionally accepted papers. Authors must make a set of mandatory revisions. The second phase assesses whether the required revisions have been addressed. The outcome can be Accept, Revise or Reject.  
 Submissions   
 PACMPL uses double-blind reviewing. Authors’ identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted. Papers must  
 omit author names and institutions, 
  use the third person when referencing your work, 
  anonymise supplementary material. 
  Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission; see the DBR FAQ. When in doubt, contact the Review Committee Chairs.  
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy  . Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism  . Submissions are expected to comply with the ACM Policies for Authorship  .  
 Artifacts   
 Authors should indicate with their initial submission if an artifact exists, describe its nature and limitations, and indicate if it will be submitted for evaluation. Accepted papers that fail to provide an artifact will be requested to explain the reason they cannot support replication. It is understood that some papers have no artifacts.  
 Publication   
 Selection Criteria   
 We consider the following criteria when evaluating papers:  
 Novelty:  The paper presents new ideas and results and places them appropriately within the context established by previous research.  
 Importance:  The paper contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the field. We also welcome papers that diverge from the dominant trajectory of the field.  
 Evidence:  The paper presents sufficient evidence supporting its claims, such as proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, case studies, and anecdotes.  
 Clarity:  The paper presents its contributions, methodology and results clearly.  
 Artifacts   
 Q: Are artifacts required?   
 No! It is understood that some papers have no artifacts. But if an artifact is not provided when the claims in the paper refer to an artifact, the authors must explain why their work is not available for repetition.  
 Q: Can a paper be accepted if the artifact is rejected?   
 Yes! The reasons for rejecting an artifact are multiple and often stem from the quality of the packaging.  
 Double-Blinding Submissions (Authors)   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 Q: Should I change the name of my system?   
 No.  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?   
 Cite the code in your paper, but remove the URL and, instead say “link to repository removed for double blind review”. If you believe reviewer access to your code would help during author response, contact the Review Committee Chairs.  
 Q: I am submitting an extension of my workshop paper, should I anonymize reference to that work?   
 No. But we recommend you do not use the same title, so that it is clearly distinguishes the papers.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my paper on my web page or arXiv? send it to colleagues? give a talk about it? on social media?   
 We have developed guidelines to help navigate the tension between the normal communication of scientific results and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of authors. Roughly speaking, you may discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are gray areas and trade-offs. Things you may do:  
 Put your submission on your home page. 
  Discuss your work with anyone not on the review committees or reviewers with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. 
  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on arXiv or a similar site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-blind reviewing, etc. 
  Things you should not do:  
 Contact members of the review committee about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. 
  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, OOPSLA paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternately, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. 
  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Review Committee Chairs.
