 The 31st IEEE/ACM International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC 2023) is the premier venue for work in the area of program comprehension. It encompasses both human activities for comprehending the software and technologies for supporting such comprehension. ICPC 2023 promises to provide a quality forum for researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to present and to discuss state-of-the-art results and best practices in the field of program comprehension. ICPC 2023 is co-located with ICSE 2023.  
 ICPC 2023 solicits four main categories of research contributions: research papers, early research achievement (ERA) papers, replications and negative results papers, and tool demos. On top of this, journal first papers from selected journals will be accepted for presentation. Research papers describe original work in the area of program comprehension; ERA papers report early research results with the main goal of fostering discussion at the conference. Replications and negative results papers concern with the re-execution of existing research aimed at strengthening previous findings as well as the presentation of sound empirical methods leading to negative results. Finally, tool demonstrations report about new instruments making available and usable to practitioners program comprehension methods.
