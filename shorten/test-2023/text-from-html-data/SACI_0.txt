  Welcome to SACI 2023!   
 Authors are welcome to submit original and unpublished papers and attend the IEEE 17 th  International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics (SACI 2023)  to be held on May 23-26, 2023  in Timisoara, Romania  .  
  SACI conference appears on the Australian Research Council list, in class C.  
  Since we are still living in pandemic era, the conference is going to be organized in hybrid, ie. everyone is welcome to Timisoara to attend personally, but it is possible to present the paper online via Zoom for those who can not arrange the travel. Anyway, all papers must be presented either onsite or online. Participants have the possibility to decide the presentation method during online registration.   
 Call for Papers    
 The conference appears on the IEEE Conference Search  .  
  Conference proceedings that meet IEEE quality review standards may be eligible for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library.
