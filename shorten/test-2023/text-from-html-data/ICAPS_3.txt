 For 2023, ICAPS invited paper submissions related to the theory and applications of intelligent planning and scheduling technology. The papers included in this issue have been organized into four tracks — a main conference track and three special tracks, consisting of industry and applications, planning and learning, and robotics. This year, ICAPS 2023 was collocated with the International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS 2023) and the International Workshop on Planning & Scheduling for Space (IWPSS 2023).
