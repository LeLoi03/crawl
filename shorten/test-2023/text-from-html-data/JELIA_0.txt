JELIA - European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence  
 About JELIA  
 Logics have, for many years, laid claim to providing a formal basis for the study and development of applications and systems in Artificial Intelligence. With the depth and maturity of formalisms, methodologies, and logic-based systems today, this claim is stronger than ever.  
 The increasing interest in this forum, its international level with growing participation from researchers outside Europe, and the overall technical quality, has turned JELIA into a major biennial forum for the discussion of logic-based approaches to artificial intelligence.  
  JELIA 2023 - 18th Edition of the European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence   
 The conference is to be held on September 20 - 22, 2023 organized by the TU Dresden  , Germany. For further information please visit the website of the conference  .
