 Bläsius, Thomas; Friedrich, Tobias; Stangl, David; Weyand, Christopher An Efficient Branch-and-Bound Solver for Hitting Set   Algorithm Engineering and Experiments (ALENEX) 2022 | [ Abstract  ]  [ BibTeX  ]  [ URL  ]  [ DOI  ]  [ Download  ] | The hitting set problem asks for a collection of sets over a universe \(U\) to find a minimum subset of \(U\) that intersects each of the given sets. It is NP-hard and equivalent to the problem set cover. We give a branch-and-bound algorithm to solve hitting set. Though it requires exponential time in the worst case, it can solve many practical instance from different domains in reasonable time. Our algorithm outperforms a modern ILP solver, the state-of-the-art for hitting set, by at least an order of magnitude on most instances. | @inproceedings{blasius2022efficient abstract = {The hitting set problem asks for a collection of sets over a universe \(U\) to find a minimum subset of \(U\) that intersects each of the given sets.
