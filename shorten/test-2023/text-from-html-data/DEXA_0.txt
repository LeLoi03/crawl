  Steering Committee 
  Over three decades ago, Prof. Dr. Roland Wagner  and Prof. Dr. A Min Tjoa  recognized the need for an international platform to address the rapidly growing fields of Databases and Expert Systems Applications. This vision gave birth to DEXA, a conference that began as a small gathering of innovative minds in Austria. Today, DEXA has evolved into a global event, attracting more than 5,000 participants—including distinguished speakers, researchers, developers, and industry experts—from around the world.
