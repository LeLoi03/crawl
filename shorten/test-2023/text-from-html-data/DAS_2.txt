 DAS: 15th IAPR International Workshop on Document Analysis Systems  
 09/01/2022    Christophe Bobineau      
  Lieu :  La Rochelle, France  
 DAS 2022 is the 15th international IAPR-sponsored workshop dedicated towards system-level approaches and related challenges in document analysis and recognition domain. Typically, the workshop covers invited speaker talks along with oral, poster, tutorial, demo sessions and working group discussions. Springer will publish the proceedings (for accepted full papers).  
 DAS 2022 will be held in the historical city of La Rochelle located on the French Atlantic coast. La Rochelle is famous for its old port, stunning seaside views, urban beaches, and for the second largest private aquarium in Europe.  
 DAS 2022 will accept contributions of different types including full papers (that will be presented orally or by poster), short papers (presented only by posters, prototypes, or demonstrations). All submissions (for both full and short papers) will pass through a rigorous review process to evaluate the submitted work against several criteria including originality, quality of work and presentation ideas, novelty, and relevance to document analysis systems.  
  TOPICS  
  DAS addresses document analysis technologies including models, methods and relevant applications that satisfy actual engineering requirements. The workshop provides an exciting platform for interactions and high-level technical exchanges between industrial and academic communities.  
 Any of the following topics of interest may be addressed:  
  *Document analysis systems  
  *Document understanding  
  *Layout analysis  
  *Camera-based document analysis  
  *Document analysis for digital humanities  
  *Document analysis for libraries and archives  
  *Performance evaluation  
  *Applications  
 SUBMISSION TYPES  
  DAS 2022 expects submissions in the Springer LNCS format based on the following types of papers:  
 Full papers  
  Full papers should describe complete works of original research. Authors are invited to submit original unpublished research papers, up to 15 pages length, that are not being considered in another forum. This restriction does not apply to unpublished technical reports or papers included in self-archive repositories (departmental, arXiv.org, etc.) that are not peer-reviewed.  
 Short papers  
  Short papers provide an opportunity to report on research in progress, to present demos and novel positions on document analysis systems. Authors may submit short papers (up to 4 pages in length). Short papers will also undergo review and will appear in an extra booklet, not in the official DAS2022 proceedings.
