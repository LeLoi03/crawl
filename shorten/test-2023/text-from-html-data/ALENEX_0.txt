 About the Conference  
 The aim of ALENEX is to provide a forum for the presentation of original research in the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of algorithms and data structures. Typical submissions will include an extensive experimental analysis of nontrivial algorithmic results, ideally bridging the gap between theory and practice. We also invite submissions that address methodological issues and standards in the experimental evaluation of algorithms and data structures.  
 Relevant areas of applied algorithmic research include but are not limited to databases; geometry; graphs and networks, including web applications; operations research; combinatorial aspects of scientific computing; and computational problems in the natural sciences or engineering.  
 Also encouraged are submissions that address algorithms and data structures for advanced models of computing, including memory hierarchies and parallel computing, ranging from instruction parallelism over multicore computing to high-performance and cloud computing.  
 Proceedings will be published openly and electronically in January 2023 as SIAM ePubs. ALENEX is supported by SIAM.  
 ALENEX is co-located with the meetings listed below. Since researchers in all fields are approaching the problem of learning detailed information about the performance of particular algorithms, we expect that interesting synergies will develop.  
 The following meetings will be held jointly:  
  ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA23)
