 Proceedings of the 2023 ACM/SPEC International Conference  
 It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 14th annual ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE 2023) and to the cultural city of Coimbra - located in the center of Portugal, known as A cidade dos estudantes (the city of the students), and hosting the oldest University in Portugal and of Portuguese language, the University of Coimbra.  
 Performance, energy efficiency and reliability are becoming central to the acceptance and sustainability of modern computing systems. However, they are also becoming more and more challenging to achieve. The computing systems are constantly growing in complexity and becoming more tightly integrated in human interaction, which makes their behavior more complex and therefore more difficult to engineer and understand. We need to be able to manage this complexity so that our systems remain reliable, trustable and performant.
