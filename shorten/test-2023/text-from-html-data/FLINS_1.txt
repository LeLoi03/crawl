   Preview Abstract  Influence maximization is an important research topic in complex networks, aiming to find a seed node set with the most significant ultimate influence in social networks. Recently, the I_WVoteRank algorithm proposed a semi-local extended neighborhood concept based on the WVoteRank algorithm, considering the 1-hop and 2-hop neighbors in the voting process to calculate the voting scores of nodes. However, it initializes the voting ability of all nodes to 1. In contrast, we propose a voting method called WVoteRank++, which initializes the voting ability of nodes to their degree. This approach is significant as it considers the node’s connectivity, thus providing a more accurate representation of its influence. To reduce the time complexity, we only update the voting scores of seed nodes and their influenced neighbors within three hops. Additionally, we introduce the concept of voting proportion, which measures the percentage of votes a node casts to its neighboring nodes. This concept is crucial in our algorithm as it helps determine the influence of a node on its neighbors. We use the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered and Linear Threshold models to simulate the spreading progress on six real and synthetic datasets. The experimental results show that, in most cases, the proposed algorithm outperforms other baseline methods regarding the final infected scale, the infection scale, and the LT model.

   Preview Abstract  Voice recordings constitute information that enriches previous studies on mood disorders in which sensor data that measure physical activity are used. The analysis of all these data is applied to mental health to prevent crises due to depression or mania mainly. This chapter analyzes voice records and the application of machine learning for the first classification of emotions (sadness, happiness, fear, etc.). Subsequently, the emotions detected will be associated with mood states (mania, depression, mixed, euthymia, etc.). The usefulness of voice recordings to improve diagnostic prediction in the classification of mood disorders is concluded.

   Preview Abstract  Attribute reduction has the ability to identify essential features, reduce feature dimensions, and improve the classification of learning models. The study of attribute reduction methods for ordered decision systems, which are data with preferred order relations, is a popular research topic. In this chapter, a heuristic attribute reduction method based on self-information is proposed by improving the computation of the approximation set. First, by choosing the triangular matrix form, we cleverly optimize the matrix computation process, which facilitates the storage of relations among multiple objects and saves time effectively at the same time. Second, we introduce a more efficient method to compute the approximation set, which further improves the computational efficiency of the algorithm. The adoption of self-information as the uncertainty measure considers both deterministic information and possible categorization information. Finally, the validation practice on multiple datasets fully proves the effectiveness of the algorithm. From the experimental results, the algorithm in this chapter can effectively remove irrelevant or redundant attributes, and at the same time, it is also more efficient compared to other algorithms due to the improved approximation set calculation method.

   Preview Abstract  Scalability challenges in recommender systems refer to the difficulties that arise when maintaining systems that can handle growing datasets. On the other hand, state-of-the-art recommender systems are focusing only on increasing the number of transactions (by using evaluation metrics based on rating or ranking). However, the success of a recommender system may be reflected in business metrics, such as increased sales, revenue, user retention, or customer satisfaction. In this chapter, we aim to overcome these two challenges together: “how to define own targets (evaluation metrics) on a recommender system?” and in the meanwhile “how to scale it on big data?”. We proposed a collaborative filtering method called “TOROS: Target Oriented O  (n)  Recommender System”. TOROS reduces the similarity calculation complexity from O  (n 2   )  to O  (n)  and it has been evaluated on both publicly available datasets and also real-world e-commerce datasets of an e-commerce services provider company Frizbit S.L. We have compared TOROS with state-of-the-art recommender system algorithms and evaluated based on time and space consumption yet. As future work, we also evaluate the efficiency of TOROS in terms of various business-specific targets.

   Preview Abstract  The equipment operational state detection is important in modern industry for reducing production costs and improving production efficiency. However, due to the complex and continuous nature of the papermaking process, analyzing paper break faults remains challenging. This chapter proposes a paper break fault classification and identification method based on a Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) and a Softmax classifier. A stacked autoencoder model is established and trained to extract deep features from the data, and a Softmax classifier is employed to identify paper breakage faults based on the extracted features. A case study with data collected from a real paper mill demonstrates that the classification model based on SAE feature extraction and Softmax classifier can effectively achieve paper break fault recognition.

   Preview Abstract  The interest in the use of the ChatGpt tool by professionals in the tourism sector is increasing, but the acceptance of this tool by these professionals is not the same for all, there being different factors that affect its acceptance. In this chapter, first, the interest in this topic is demonstrated by means of a bibliometric study formed by related scientific publications, second, a co-occurrence study is carried out on the publications found to determine the most significant variables, and, from them, lastly, to obtain the factors mentioned at the beginning, thus creating a theoretical adaptation of the technological adaptation model, that model how the tourism sector comes to accept and use ChatGpt. With this information, a company in the tourism sector has a theoretical evaluation model to measure the degree of acceptance of its workers toward ChatGpt tools, being able to distinguish the strongest points and having the opportunity to establish an adaptation strategy according to the weakest points.

   Preview Abstract  The study of metro flow has become a hot topic and an important research element in urban computing. Metro flow is affected by the topology of metro network and the POI around metro stations. It is a challenge to extract the effective patterns of metro flow from the complex data. In this chapter, we construct metro flow knowledge graph to depict the topological relations between metro stations, the relations between metro stations and POIs, and the relations between metro stations and flows. Since metro flow changes over time, we add the corresponding time constrain to each relation. In addition, due to the complexity of relations, the time granularity of the constraints on the relations varies. Therefore, for effective knowledge graph representation learning, we propose a multi-temporal granularity metro flow temporal knowledge graph (MGMF-TKG) embedding method. Specifically, first, we construct a metro flow temporal knowledge graph from metro flow data and use a combination of sinusoidal waves to represent temporal information. Then, a multi-time granularity knowledge graph representation learning framework is constructed to realize the representation of relations between entities under complex time information constraints. Finally, experiments are conducted using Chongqing metro flow data, and the experimental results show that the method outper-forms the benchmark methods.
