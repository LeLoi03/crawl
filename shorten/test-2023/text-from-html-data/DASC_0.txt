 As computer and communication systems as well as other systems such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), Autonomous Robotic Systems become increasingly large and complex, their Dependability and Security play critical role at supporting next-generation science, engineering, and commercial applications. It remains a challenge to design, analyze, evaluate, and improve the dependability and security for a trusted computing environment. Trusted computing targets computing systems as well as services that are dependable, secure, protectable, predictable, traceable, controllable, autonomous, and sustainable.  
 At the same time, the increasing scale and complexity of systems call for the autonomic computing paradigm, which meets the requirements of self-management, and autonomous systems. Trusted and autonomic computing/autonomous systems need synergistic research efforts covering many disciplines, ranging from natural sciences to social sciences. It requires scientific and technological advances in a wide variety of fields, as well as new software, architectures, and communication technology that support the integration of the constituent technologies.  
 IEEE DASC 2023 will be held during November 13-17, 2023, in Abu DHbai, UAE co-located with IEEE CyberSciTech 2023  , IEEE PICom 2023  , and IEEE CBDCom 2023  . It aims to bring together computer scientists, industrial engineers, and researchers to discuss and exchange theoretical and implementation results, novel designs, work-in-progress, experience, case studies, and trend-setting ideas in the areas of dependability, security, trust and/or autonomic computing, and autonomous systems.
