  A bimodal taint analysis called "Fluffy"  
 The paper was written by Yi Wai Chow (during his master's thesis at the University of Stuttgart), Max Schaefer (GitHub) and Prof. Michael Pradel  (University of Stuttgart).  
  Surprising result for WebAssembly call graphs  
 Recognised as an ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Artifact was " Thatâ€™s a Tough Call: Studying the Challenges of Call Graph Construction for WebAssembly  ". In their work, the researchers seek to better understand those challenges that arise in the static construction of call graphs for WebAssembly. Call graphs are at the core of many interprocedural static analysis and optimization techniques. In detail, twelve challenges are identified and examined on 8,000 real code examples. Surprising result: Four existing methods for static analysis are unreliable, without this having been documented so far.  
 Daniel Lehmann  (University of Stuttgart), Michelle Thalakottur (Northeastern University), Prof. Frank Tip (Northeastern University) and Prof. Michael Pradel  (University of Stuttgart) contributed to the paper.
