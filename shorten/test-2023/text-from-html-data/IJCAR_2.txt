 CALL FOR PAPERS  
 IJCAR 2024  
 The 12th International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning

 =======================================================================  
 IJCAR is the premier international joint conference on all topics in automated reasoning.  
 IJCAR 2024 will be hosted by the Inria Nancy Research Center and LORIA in Nancy, France, from July 1-6, 2024.  
 IJCAR 2024 is the merger of leading events in automated reasoning:  
 * CADE (Conference on Automated Deduction)  
 * FroCoS (Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems)  
 TOPICS  
 ======  
 IJCAR 2024 invites submissions related to all aspects of automated or interactive logical reasoning, including foundations, implementations, and applications. Original research papers and descriptions/evaluations of working automated deduction systems or proof assistant systems are solicited.  
 IJCAR topics include the following:  
 * Logics of interest include: propositional, first-order, classical, equational, higher-order, non-classical, constructive, modal, temporal, many-valued, substructural, description, type theory.  
 * Methods of interest include: tableaux, sequent calculi, resolution, model-elimination, inverse method, paramodulation, term rewriting, induction, unification, constraint solving, decision procedures, model generation, model checking, semantic guidance, interactive theorem proving, logical frameworks, AI-related methods for deductive systems, proof presentation, automated theorem proving, combination of decision or proof procedures, SAT and SMT solving, machine learning and theorem proving, integration of automated provers/proof assistants in automated test generators, program synthesisers, verified compilers, intelligent systems, agent based systems, knowledge processing systems, formal methods tools and other symbolic tools, etc.

 All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another peer-reviewed journal or conference. The following paper categories are welcome:  
 Regular papers describing solid new research results. They can be  
 up to 15 pages in LNCS style, including figures but excluding references  
 case studies and domain models, etc. They can be up to 7 pages in  
 LNCS style, excluding references and appendices.  
 All submissions will be judged on relevance, originality, significance, correctness, and readability. Proofs of theoretical results that do not fit in the page limit, executables of systems, and input data of experiments should be made available, e.g., via a reference to a website or in an appendix of the paper.  
 The review process will include a feedback/rebuttal period where authors will have the option to respond to reviewer comments. The PC chairs may solicit further reviews after the rebuttal period.  
 All submissions must be formatted using the Springer LNCS styles  and submitted in PDF via EasyChair:
