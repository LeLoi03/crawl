 23rd ACM Symposium on Document Engineering (DocEng 2023)   
 From Tuesday, August 22, 2023  
  To Friday, August 25, 2023  
 The 23rd ACM Symposium on Document Engineering (DocEng'23) seeks original research papers that focus on the design, implementation, development, management, use and evaluation of advanced systems where documents and document collections play a key role. DocEng emphasizes innovative approaches to document engineering technology, use of documents and document collections in real-world applications, and novel principles, tools and processes that improve our ability to create, manage, maintain, share, and productively use these. In particular, DocEng'23 seeks contributions in the area of cooperative work with documents.
