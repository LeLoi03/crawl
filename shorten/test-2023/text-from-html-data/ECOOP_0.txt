  ECOOP 2023  
 ECOOP is Europe’s longest-standing annual Programming Languages conference, bringing together researchers, practitioners, and students to share their ideas and experiences in all topics related to programming languages, software development, systems and applications. ECOOP welcomes high quality research papers relating to these fields in a broad sense.  
 ECOOP is committed to affordable open access publishing. Recent year’s publications have been published by Dagstuhl’s LIPIcs series  under a Creative Commons CC-BY license where the authors retain their copyright. ECOOP articles have been published without open access publishing fee and can be accessed via a DOI. LIPIcs is indexed in DBLP, Google Scholar, Scopus and others.

 Highlights  
 This ECOOP edition continues the last edition’s innovations, embracing the entire landscape of programming technologies with a revised reviewing and publishing model:  
 Broader Scope.  ECOOP welcomes contributions in all aspect of practice and theory of programming languages, systems and environments, ranging the whole spectrum from novel ideas to evaluation of existing solutions. Authors can pick one of four broad categories: research papers  , reproduction studies  , experience papers  , and brave new ideas  or pearls  . Negative results and short papers are welcome. 
  Continuous Submissions.  ECOOP is moving towards frequent submission deadlines. ECOOP 2023 has two rounds of submissions, one in December and the second in March. Each round is double-blind  and delivers its results within two months  . 
  Collaborative Reviewing.  ECOOP encourages constructive reviewing where papers that are not accepted outright are given clear and actionable suggestions for improvements so that they can be resubmitted in subsequent rounds; thus, following the reviewing model of many journals but with timely reviews. Unlike conference reviewing, the same reviewers will remain attached to a submission throughout the process even if it takes multiple rounds. 
  Frictionless Submission.  ECOOP enforces neither strict page limits nor strict formatting requirements for submitted papers. Instead, we encourage authors to write what the clearest possible submission while keeping in mind that reviewers can only spend the same finite  amount of time on each paper. 
  Artifacts Now.  Artifacts supporting the scientific claims of papers can now submitted together with their paper and thus all authors will benefit from the feedback of the artifact evaluation committee. 
  Open Access.  ECOOP remains committed to open access, all papers appearing the proceedings of the conference, all talks, and all artifacts will be archived and made available free of charge and without author processing fees. 
  Journal First.  ECOOP papers can be submitted to special issues of three journals, TOPLAS, Science of Computer Programming and the Journal of Object Technology. The requirements of these journals apply for submissions. For SCP and JOT, the ECOOP program committee will act as reviewers with the same deadline. TOPLAS follow its own process. JOT is open access. 
  Journal After.  Selected papers will be invited to publish extended versions in special issues of our associated journals. An extended abstract of the paper will appear in the ECOOP proceedings. Journal after submission at SCP and JOT are reviewed by the ECOOP PC, while TOPLAS uses its own process. 
 ISSTA/ECOOP'23: Welcome to Seattle and logistics  
 Dear ISSTA/ECOOP 2023 participants,  
 We look forward to welcoming you to the joint conference next week.  
 Below are a number of logistical notes as well as guidelines for presenters. (For convenience, this and other communications will appear on the conference website as well.)  
 On behalf of the ISSTA/ECOOP 2023 organizing committee, welcome to Seattle!

 Registration   
 Please pick up your conference badge and registration package at the registration desk in the Allen Center. Just enter the building through the sliding doors, and the reception desk will be in front of you. The registration desk will be staffed between 8am and 5pm, Monday through Thursday, and between 8am and noon on Friday.  
 Technical Program   
 You can find a program overview and details for the entire week on the ISSTA/ECOOP website  . (The programs on the ISSTA and ECOOP website instances are in sync with the overall program, but provide a view that is tailored to each conference.)  
 Guidelines for presenters   
 In-person presentations:  Presentation slots are 15 minutes (unless differently indicated by your track chair). Please follow the instructions provided to you by your track chair to allow for enough time for Q&A. Please go to your allocated room 15 minutes before the session start time to meet with the Session Chair (see technical program), review the pronunciation of your name, and familiarize yourself with the room and A/V set up, if needed (see Rehearsal and equipment check). You are expected to use your own laptop for presentations, which needs to be connected via HDMI. Some dongles (USB-C) may be available but bring your own adapter if needed. For ISSTA and ECOOP presentations, the A/V system is set up such that it will capture the screen, presenter, and audio, which will be streamed for remote participants via Zoom. Note that you do not need to join a Zoom meeting, simply plug in your device and use the wireless microphone provided. 
  ISSTA-Online presentations:  Presentation slots are 10 minutes. Prepare for 7.5 minutes of presentation and 2.5 minutes of Q&A. You will be required to present via Zoom. Please join the zoom meeting for your online session 15 minutes before the session start time. The zoom meeting details will be shared separately before the main conference. To avoid complications, please install the latest Zoom application on your computer and do not present via a web browser. Make sure your Zoom setup is working properly by running the Zoom audio/video test before joining the call. If your presentation contains any audio, you must enable the sharing of audio when sharing your screen. When you have finished your presentation, please stop sharing your screen and mute your microphone. 
  Rehearsal and equipment check:  We have reserved room G04 for presentation rehearsal and equipment testing. The A/V setup is identical in all conference rooms. If your set up works in G04, it should work everywhere. 
  Need Help?   
 Signs and student volunteers (in purple shirts) will guide you and help you find your way around campus. If you need additional help or support, please let a staff member at the registration desk know or email April and René.  
 Online sessions and Zoom links  
 Dear ISSTA/ECOOP 2023 participants,

 For online presenters   
 Please make sure to virtually join your meeting room 15 minutes prior to the start of your session to connect with your session chair and a student volunteer in the (physical) conference room.  
 For in-person participants   
 All remote presentations are streamed in the physical conference rooms (in the order as listed in the program). In-person participants will be able to ask questions using a wireless microphone and do not need to connect to Zoom.
