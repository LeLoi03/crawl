 ICGT 2023 - CALL FOR PARTICIPATION  
 16th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2023)  
 19-20 July in Leicester, UK, as part of STAF 2023  
 ABOUT   
 The International Conference on Graph Transformation aims at fostering exchange and collaboration of researchers from different backgrounds working with graphs and graph transformation, either in contributing to their theoretical foundations or by applying established formalisms to classical or novel areas. The conference not only serves as a well-established scientific publication outlet, but also as a platform to boost inter- and intra-disciplinary research and to leeway for new ideas. The 16th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2023) will be held in Leicester, UK, as part of STAF 2023 (Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations). The conference takes place under the auspices of EASST, EATCS and IFIP WG 1.3. Proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.
