 Participative computing for sustainable futures  
 NordiCHI 2022 in Aarhus will continue the NordiCHI tradition of being an international-level venue for dissemination and development of Human-Computer Interaction research in the broadest sense. The conference will be held in Aarhus, Denmark on October 8-12 2022. This website will be updated with more detailed information as the conference approaches.  
 NordiCHI 2022 in Aarhus will highlight the Nordic traditions for bringing research into societal context through the choice of keynote speakers, panels and other invited sessions; and through outreach to public sector, industrial, civil society and cultural actors.  
 Participatory design has grown out of Nordic research, together with the trade unions emphasising workersâ€™ rights to codetermination and control over professional quality. While participation has become a widespread method in design, it still denotes a shift to understand users as active participants taking control, rather than users as system components. When people participate actively, they are not merely users: they are workers, citizens, artists, students, tenants, etc.  
 NordiCHI 2022 in Aarhus promotes sustainable futures by celebrating active participation in the development and use of interactive technologies.
