 Plenary Breakfast: Operator Roundtable  This plenary discussion will focus on the value interventions bring to the industry in a time of intense capital discipline, but expect us to cover a wide range of other relevant topics. Hear from operators on what they see as needs in the industry and where we should be heading forward. This event will be a highlight of our 2023 program and will provide some key insights.
