  Industry and Applications Track 
 The IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE) 2023 Industry and Applications Track will feature high-quality submissions describing innovation in all areas of data management systems as well as innovative and demanding application scenarios.  
 For the first time in the ICDE Industry and Applications Track, this year, all accepted papers will be considered by a committee for the Best Paper Award  .  
 Topics of Interest   
 The track will emphasize submissions that describe innovative industrial advancements in relevant areas including, but not limited to:  
  Information integration 
  Information integrity 
  Submissions that do not articulate the innovative aspect of a product or application project (including relevant open-source software), but rather give a general overview or address a pure research problem, are discouraged. Each submission must include at least one author with a non-academic affiliation.  
 The Industry and Applications Track will accept short (6 pages + unlimited space for references) as well as long (12 pages + unlimited space for references) submissions.  
 Important Dates   
 Submissions due: | October 19, 2022 
  Notification to authors (Accept/Revise/Reject): | December 14, 2022 
  Revisions due: | January 25, 2023 
  Final notification to authors (Accept/Reject): | February 14, 2023 
  Camera-ready Copies due: | February 28, 2023 
  Submission Guidelines   
 Manuscripts must be prepared in accordance with the IEEE format   , and submitted to the Industry and Applications Track of the ICDE 2023 submission website   .  
 Long papers must not exceed 12 pages + unlimited space for references, and short papers must not exceed 6 pages + unlimited space for references. Only electronic submissions in PDF format will be considered. Papers that do not follow the guidelines or are not within the scope of topics relevant to ICDE will be desk rejected. Authors are encouraged to contact the industrial track chairs if they need clarification regarding the suitability of their work to this track.  
 A paper submitted to ICDE 2023 cannot be under review for any other conference or journal during the entire time it is considered for ICDE 2023, and it must be substantially different from any previously published work.  
 Submissions will be reviewed in a single-blind manner. Each submission must include all author names and affiliations. Changes to the author list after paper acceptance are not permitted. In case an exceptional situation arises necessitating a change in the author list, the situation needs to be explained via email to the industrial track chairs, who will decide whether to approve the change.  
 All accepted papers will appear in the proceedings. The best papers will be selected for extended versions to be published in the IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from IEEE Xplore), if none of the authors attends the conference to present their paper.  
 All submissions should follow ICDE 2023 Research Track guidelines on Inclusion and Diversity in Writing, and Conflicts of Interest   .
