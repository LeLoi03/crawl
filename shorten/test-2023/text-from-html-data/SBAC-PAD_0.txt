 Arriving at PUCRS  
 There are several entrances to the PUCRS campus, but we recommend SBAC-PAD attendees to use entrances 1 and 2, located at Ipiranga Avenue (Avenida Ipiranga). To access the campus through these entrances, we suggest the following drop-off points:  
  The | drop-off 2 | is in front of the museum and it gives access to the campus through entrance 1. Choosing the Science and Technology Museum of PUCRS ( | Museu de Ciência e Tecnologia da PUCRS | ) as your destination on ride-hailing apps, or for your taxi driver, will lead you to this drop-off point.
