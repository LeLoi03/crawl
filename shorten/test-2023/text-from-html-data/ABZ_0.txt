 A Universal Control Construct for Abstract State Machines    
 Conference Paper    
 Conference Paper    
 This paper presents an encoding of a non-temporal fragment of the \({\textsc {TLA}} ^{{+}}\) language, which includes untyped set theory, functions, arithmetic expressions, and Hilbert’s \(\varepsilon \) operator, into many-sorted first-order logic, the input language of state-of-the-art smt solvers. This translation, based on encoding techniques such as boolification, injection of unsorted expressions into sorted languages, term rewriting, and abstraction, is the core component of a back-end prover based on smt solvers for the \({\textsc {TLA}} ^{{+}}\) Proof System.

 A Rigorous Correctness Proof for Pastry    
 Conference Paper    
 Peer-to-peer protocols for maintaining distributed hash tables, such as Pastry or Chord, have become popular for a class of Internet applications. While such protocols promise certain properties concerning correctness and performance, verification attempts using formal methods invariably discover border cases that violate some of those guarantees. Tianxiang Lu reported correctness problems in published versions of Pastry and also developed a model, which he called LuPastry, for which he provided a partial proof of correct delivery assuming no node departures, mechanized in the TLA\(^+\) Proof System. Lu’s proof is based on certain assumptions that were left unproven. We found counter-examples to several of these assumptions. In this paper, we present a revised model and rigorous proof of correct delivery, which we call LuPastry\(^+\). Aside from being the first complete proof, LuPastry\(^+\) also improves upon Lu’s work by reformulating parts of the specification in such a way that the reasoning complexity is confined to a small part of the proof.   
 Enabling Analysis for Event-B    
 Full-text available    
 Conference Paper    
 In this paper we present a static analysis to determine how events influence each other in Event-B models. The analysis, called an enabling analysis, uses syntactic and constraint-based techniques to compute the effect of executing one event on the guards of another event. We describe the foundations of the approach along with the realisation in ProB. The output of the analysis can help a user to understand the control flow of a formal model. Additionally, we discuss how the information of the enabling analysis can be used to obtain a new optimised model checking algorithm. We evaluate both the performance of the enabling analysis and the new model checking technique on a variety of models. The technique is also applicable to B, TLA + , and Z models.   
 A Compact Encoding of Sequential ASMs in Event-B    
 Conference Paper    
 We present a translation of sequential ASMs to Event-B specifications. The translation also addresses the partial update problem, and allows a variable to be updated (consistently) in parallel. On the theoretical side, the translation highlights the intricacies of ASM rule execution in terms of Event-B semantics. On the practical side, we show on a series of examples that the Event-B encoding remains compact and is amenable to proof within Rodin as well as animation and model checking using ProB.   
 Proof Assisted Symbolic Model Checking for B and Event-B    
 Conference Paper    
 We have implemented various symbolic model checking algorithms, like BMC, k-Induction and IC3 for B and Event-B. The high-level nature of B and Event-B accounts for complicated constraints arising in these symbolic analysis techniques. In this paper we suggest using static information stemming from proof obligations to simplify occurring constraints. We show how to include proof information in the aforementioned algorithms. Using different benchmarks we compare explicit state to symbolic model checking as well as techniques with and without proof assistance. In particular for models with large branching factor, e.g., due to complicated data values being manipulated, the symbolic techniques fare much better than explicit state model checking. The inclusion of proof information results in further clear performance improvements.   
 On Component-Based Reuse for Event-B    
 Conference Paper    
 Efficient reuse is a goal of many software engineering strategies and is useful in the safety-critical domain where formal development is required. Event-B can be used to develop safety-critical systems, but could be improved by a component-based reuse strategy. In this paper, we outline a component-based reuse methodology for Event-B. It provides a means for bottom-up scalability, and can also be used with the existing top-down approach. We describe the process of creating library components , their composition, and specification of new properties (involving the composed elements). We introduce Event-B component interfaces and propose to use a diagrammatic representation of component instances (based on iUML-B) which can be used to describe the relationships between the composed elements. We also discuss the specification of communication flow across component boundaries and describe the additional proof obligations that are required.   
 Using B and ProB for Data Validation Projects    
 Conference Paper    
 Constraint satisfaction and data validation problems can be expressed very elegantly in state-based formal methods such as B. However, is B suited for developing larger applications and are there existing tools that scale for these projects? In this paper, we present our experiences on two real-world data validation projects from different domains which are based on the B language and use ProB as the central validation tool. The first project is the validation of university timetables, and the second project is the validation of railway topologies. Based on these two projects, we present a general structure of a data validation project in B and outline common challenges along with various solutions. We also discuss possible evolutions of the B language to make it (even) more suitable for such projects.

 Generating Event-B Specifications from Algorithm Descriptions    
 Conference Paper    
 We present a high-level algorithm description language which is translated to Event-B specifications for simulation, model checking and proof. Rather than trying to recover the program structure from a lower-level Event-B specification, we start with a high-level description of the algorithm. Our goals are more tractable code generation and more convenient modelling, while keeping the power of the Event-B method in terms of proof and refinement. We present various examples of algorithm descriptions and show that our translation ensures that they can be completely proven within Rodin while achieving a high-level of automatic proof.   
 Formal Proofs of Termination Detection for Local Computations by Refinement-Based Compositions    
 Conference Paper    
 In this paper, we propose a formal framework enhancing the termination detection property of distributed algorithms and reusing their specifications as well as their proofs. By relying on refinement and composition, we show that an algorithm specified with local termination detection, can be reused in order to compute the same algorithm with global termination detection. The main idea relies upon the development of distributed algorithms following a top/down approach and the integration of additional computation steps developed in a pre-defined module. This module is specified in a generic and scalable way in order to be composed with particular developments. Once the composition link is proven, the global termination emerges automatically.   
 How to Select the Suitable Formal Method for an Industrial Application: A Survey    
 Conference Paper    
 The share of formal methods is still marginal in contemporary systems and software engineering. One of the reasons is the absence of systematic guidelines and evaluation criteria that help software practitioners choose the right formal method for the problem at hand. In this paper, we present a comprehensive set of criteria, based on a systematic literature review and decade-long personal experience in industrial projects, for evaluating and comparing different formal methods. We argue that besides technical grounds (e.g., modeling capabilities and supported development phases), formal methods should also be evaluated from social and industrial perspectives. At the end of the paper, we present an evaluation of “ABZ” methods based on the stipulated criteria.   
 Unified Syntax for Abstract State Machines    
 Conference Paper    
 The paper presents our efforts in defining UASM, a unified syntax for Abstract State Machines (ASMs), based on the syntaxes of two of the main ASM frameworks, CoreASM and ASMETA, which have been adapted to accept UASM as input syntax of all their validation and verification tools.   
 A Relational Encoding for a Clash-Free Subset of ASMs    
 Conference Paper    
 This paper defines a static check for clash-freedom of ASM rules, including sequential and parallel composition, nondeterministic choice, and recursion. The check computes a formula that, if provable, makes a relational encoding of ASM rules possible, which is an important prerequisite for efficient deduction. The check is general enough to cover all sequential rules as well as many typical uses of parallel composition.

 A Model-Based Transformation Approach to Reuse and Retarget CASM Specifications    
 Conference Paper    
 The Abstract State Machine (ASM) theory is a way to specify algorithms, applications and systems in a formal model. Recent ASM languages and tools address either the translation of ASM specifications to a specific target programming language or aim at the execution in a specific environment. In this work-in-progress paper we outline a model-based transformation approach supporting (1) the specification of applications or systems using the Corinthian Abstract State Machine (CASM) modeling language and (2) retargeting those applications to different programming language and hardware target domains. An intermediate model is introduced, which not only captures software-based implementations, but also the generation of hardware-related code in the same model. This approach offers a new formal modeling perspective onto modular, reusable and retargetable software and hardware designs for the development of embedded systems. We provide a short overview of our CASM compiler design as well as the retargetable model-based approach to generate code for different target domains.

 ‘The Tinker’ for Rodin    
 Conference Paper    
 PSGraph [3] is a graphical proof strategy language, which uses the formalisation of labelled hierarchical graphs to provide support for the development and maintenance of large and complex proof tactics. PSGraph has been implemented as the Tinker system, which previously supported the Isabelle and ProofPower theorem provers [4]. In this paper we present a Rodin version of Tinker, which allows Rodin users to encode, analyse and debug their proof strategies in Tinker.   
 A Graphical Tool for Event Refinement Structures in Event-B    
 Full-text available    
 Conference Paper    
 The Event Refinement Structures (ERS) approach provides a graphical extension of the Event-B formal method to represent event decomposition and control-flow explicitly. In this paper we present an improved version of the ERS plug-in, which provides a graphical environment for the ERS approach within the Event-B tool, Rodin. The improved ERS plug-in is based on the available frameworks that are developed to support Event-B with an EMF framework, language extensions and generic diagram extensions.

 Semi-Automated Design Space Exploration for Formal Modelling    
 Conference Paper    
 Refinement based formal methods allow the modelling of systems through incremental steps via abstraction. Discovering the right levels of abstraction, formulating correct and meaningful invariants, and analysing faulty models are some of the challenges faced when using this technique. Here, we propose Design Space Exploration, an approach that aims to assist a designer by automatically providing high-level modelling guidance in real-time. More specifically, through the combination of common patterns of modelling with techniques from automated theory formation and automated reasoning, different design alternatives are explored and suitable models that deal with faults are proposed.   
 Handling Continuous Functions in Hybrid Systems Reconfigurations: A Formal Event-B Development    
 Conference Paper    
 This paper presents a substitution mechanism for systems having a continuous behavior. It shall preserve the safety property stating that the output of both systems remain in a safety envelope. The whole approach is formalized using Event-B, and relies on the Rodin tools and a theory of Reals provided by the Rodin Theory Plug-in to check the internal consistency with respect to safety properties, invariants and events.   
 UC-B: Use Case Modelling with Event-B    
 Conference Paper    
 Use cases are a popular but informal technique used to define and analyse system behaviour. We introduce UC-B a plug-in for the Rodin platform (Event-B tool) that supports the authoring and management of use case specifications with both informal and formal components. The formal component is based on Event-B’s mathematical language. Once the behaviour of the use case is specified, UC-B automatically generates a corresponding Event-B model. The resulting model is then amenable to the Rodin verification tools that enable system level properties to be verified. By underpinning informal use case modelling with Event-B we are able to provide greater precision and formal assurance during the early stages of design.

 A Super Industrial Application of PSGraph    
 Conference Paper    
 The ClawZ toolset has been successful in verifying that Ada code is correctly generated from Simulink models in an industrial setting, using the Z notation. D-RisQ is now extending this technique to new domains of the C programming language, which requires changes to their highly complex proof technique. In this paper, we present initial results in the technology transfer of the graphical PSGraph language to support this extension, and show feasibility of PSGraph for industrial use with strong maintainability requirements.

 How to Assure Correctness and Safety of Medical Software: The Hemodialysis Machine Case Study    
 Conference Paper    
 Medical devices are nowadays more and more software dependent, and software malfunctioning can lead to injuries or death for patients. Several standards have been proposed for the development and the validation of medical devices, but they establish general guidelines on the use of common software engineering activities without any indication regarding methods and techniques to assure safety and reliability. This paper takes advantage of the Hemodialysis machine case study to present a formal development process supporting most of the engineering activities required by the standards, and provides rigorous approaches for system validation and verification. The process is based on the Abstract State Machine formal method and its model refinement principle.   
 Validating the Requirements and Design of a Hemodialysis Machine Using iUML-B, BMotion Studio, and Co-Simulation    
 Conference Paper    
 We present a formal specification of a hemodialysis machine (HD machine) using Event-B. We model the HD machine using iUML-B state-machines and class diagrams and build a corresponding BMotion Studio visualisation. We focus on validation using (i) diagrams to aid the modelling of the sequential properties of the requirements, and (ii) ProB-based animation and visualisation tools to explore the system’s behaviour. Some of the safety properties involve dynamic behaviour which is difficult to verify in Event-B. For these properties we use co-simulation tools to validate against a continuous model of the physical behaviour.   
 Hemodialysis Machine in Hybrid Event-B    
 Conference Paper    
 The hemodialysis machine case study is examined in Hybrid Event-B (an extension of Event-B that includes provision for continuously varying behaviour as well as the usual discrete changes of state). A broadly component based strategy is adopted, using the multi-machine and coordination facilities of Hybrid Event-B. Since, like most medical procedures, hemodialysis is under overall human control, it is largely a sequential process, with some branching to deal with exceptional circumstances. This makes for a relatively uncomplicated modelling framework, provided a model of the operator is included in order to capture the handling of exceptions.

 Conference Paper    
 This paper presents the specification of the hemodialysis case study, proposed by ABZ’16 conference. The specification was carried out by a coupling of Algebraic State-Transition Diagrams (astd) and B-like methods. astd are a graphical notation, based on automata and process algebra operators. They provide an easy-to-read specification of the dynamic behaviour of the system. The data model is specified using the Event-B language. The system is incrementally designed using extended refinement of both methods.

 The RISC Algorithm Language (RISCAL) is a language for the formal modeling of theories and algorithms. A RISCAL specification describes an infinite class of models each of which has finite size; this allows to fully automatically check in such a model the validity of all theorems and the correctness of all algorithms. RISCAL thus enables us to quickly verify/falsify the specific truth of propositions in sample instances of a model class before attempting to prove their general truth in the whole class: the first can be achieved in a fully automatic way while the second typically requires our assistance. RISCAL has been mainly developed for educational purposes. To this end this paper reports on some new enhancements of the tool: the automatic generation of checkable verification conditions from algorithms, the visualization of the execution of procedures and the evaluation of formulas illustrating the computation of their results, and the generation of Web-based student exercises and assignments from RISCAL specifications. Furthermore, we report on our first experience with RISCAL in the teaching of courses on logic and formal methods and on further plans to use this tool to enhance formal education.

 The use of formal methods is often recommended to guarantee the provision of necessary services and to assess the correctness of critical properties, such as functional safety, cybersecurity, and reliability, in medical and health care devices. In the past, several formal and rigorous methods have been proposed and consequently applied for trustworthy development of medical software and systems. In this paper, we perform a systematic literature review on the available state of the art in this domain. We collect the relevant literature on the use of formal methods for modeling, design, development, verification, and validation of software-intensive medical systems. We apply standard systematic literature review techniques and run several queries in well-known repositories to obtain information that can be useful for people who are either already working in this field or planning to start. Our study covers both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the subject.

  We address the problem of model checking hybrid systems which exhibit nontrivial discrete behavior and thus cannot be treated by considering the discrete states one by one, as most currently available verification tools do. Our procedure relies on a deep integration of several techniques and tools. An extension of AND-Inverter-Graphs (AIGs) with first-order constraints serves as a compact ... [Show full abstract]  representation format for sets of configurations which are composed of continuous regions and discrete states. Boolean reasoning on the AIGs is complemented by first-order reasoning in various forms and on various levels. These include implication checks for simple constraints, test vector generation for fast inequality checks of boolean combinations of constraints, and an exact subsumption check for representations of two configurations. These techniques are integrated within a model checker for universal CTL. Technically, it deals with discrete-time hybrid systems with linear differentials. The paper presents the approach, its prototype implementation, and first experimental data.

  A verification methodology is described and evaluated to formally determine uncertain linear systems stability in digital controllers with considerations to the implementation aspects. In particular, this methodology is combined with the digital-system verifier (DSVerifier), which is a verification tool that employs Bounded Model Checking based on Satisfiability Modulo Theories to check the ... [Show full abstract]  stability of digital control systems with uncertainty. DSVerifier determines the control system stability, considering all the plant interval variation set, together with the Finite Word-length (FWL) effects in the digital controller implementation; DSVerifier checks the robust non-fragile stability of a given closed-loop system. The proposed methodology and respective tool are evaluated considering non-fragile control examples from literature. Experimental results show that the approach used in this study is able to foresee fragility problems in robust controllers, which could be overlooked by other existing approaches due to underestimating of FWL effects.

  As more computing systems are utilized in various areas of our society, the reliability of computing systems becomes a significant issue.

Such systems often control highly ... [Show full abstract]  complex continuous dynamics to interact with physical environments. To assure the reliability of safety critical hybrid systems, statistical model checking (SMC) techniques have been proposed. SMC techniques approximately compute probabilities for a target system to satisfy given requirements based on randomly sampled execution traces. In this paper, we empirically evaluated four state-ofthe- art SMC techniques on a fault-tolerant fuel control system in the automobile domain. Through the experiments, we could demonstrate that SMC is practically useful to assure the reliability of a safety critical hybrid system and we compared pros and cons of the four different SMC techniques.
