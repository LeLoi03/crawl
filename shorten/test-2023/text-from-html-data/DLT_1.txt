 DLT 2023 – Call for Papers  
 27th International Conference on Developments in Language Theory  
  Umeå, Sweden  
  June 12-16, 2023  
 The International Conference on Developments in Language Theory (DLT 2023) is an event organized to bring together members of the academic, research, and industrial community who have an interest in formal languages, automata theory, and related areas (see possible topics below). The conference will be held in conjunction with the 14th International Conference on Words (WORDS 2023) in Umeå, Sweden, one week before midsummer. Hence, for those attending it may be a good opportunity to extend their stay in northern Sweden by a week.  
 During the conference, one or more prizes for the best student papers  (sponsored by MDPI) will be awarded.

 Submission Guidelines  
 In order to facilitate the review process, all proofs omitted due to page limitations can be given in an appendix or made accessible through a reliable link to a freely available electronic preprint. Please note that the paper should be self-contained; reviewers are not required to read any additional pages, thus consulting the appendix is up to the reviewer. Papers should be submitted electronically in PDF through the EasyChair system:  
 All questions about submissions should be emailed to drewes@cs.umu.se  .
