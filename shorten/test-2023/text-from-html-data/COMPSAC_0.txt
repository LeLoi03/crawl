 COMPSAC 2023 Theme: Resilient Computing and Computing for Resilience  
  in a Sustainable Cyber-Physical World   
 The last few renditions of COMPSAC, which have been online because of COVID-19, have had profound consequences on our academic and industrial R&D communities. Yet these communities have shown resilience  in the face of this adversity. Accordingly, we are introducing a new vision for both the theoretical and practical aspects of the fields of interest of our participating communities: resilient computing and computing for resilience  .  
 During the pandemic-induced chaos of the last few years, the world has mainly managed to resist chaos and maintain a sense of order and stability. This resistance has brought a new focus and meaning to our technology research direction, i.e., resiliency, availability, and sustainability. As we go forward, we have learned that we must carefully prepare a variety of alternatives, keep them in operation, and continue to adapt them and us to changing circumstances. For instance, the notion of security can be interpreted as the maintenance of high availability. It can also be said that resilience is the ability to keep the lights burning, even if the quality of stability is significantly reduced.  
 Inspired by these thoughts, COMPSAC 2023, which is organized as a tight union of symposia, will focus on all the innovative research aspects of computing in a sustainable cyber-physical world,  including resilience computing, security, healthcare analytics, e  -government and e  -society, metaverse worlds, intelligent autonomous systems, Internet of Things networks, explainable artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and virtual augmented reality. The technical program will include keynote addresses, research papers, industrial case studies, fast abstracts, a doctoral symposium, poster sessions, workshops, and tutorials on emerging and important topics related to the conference theme. Highlights of the conference will include plenary and specialized panels that will address the technical challenges facing researchers and practitioners who are driving fundamental changes in Computers, Software, and Applications in Resilience Computing Systems and Tools. Panels will also address cultural and societal challenges raised by rapidly changing communication norms concerning computing and collaboration.  
 Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research work and industrial practice reports. Simultaneous submission to other publication venues is not permitted except as highlighted in the COMPSAC 2023 JC & CJ program. All submissions must adhere to IEEE Conference Publishing Policies  and will be vetted through the IEEE CrossCheck  portal.  
 News & Announcements   
 COMPSAC 2023 BEST PAPER AWARD   
  Adversarial Human Context Recognition: Evasion Attacks and Defenses  
  Abdulaziz Alajaji, Kavin Chandrasekaran, Luke Buquicchio, Walter Gerych, Emmanuel Agu and Elke Rundensteiner (Worcester Polytechnic Institute, United States)   
  Please be advised that COMPSAC 2023 is NOT  a hybrid conference. It is an in-person  conference that allows absentee authors to provide us with their papers plus a video presentation of those papers. All the in-person authors have also provided us with a video presentation of their papers.    
 THERE ARE NO LIVE-STREAMED SESSIONS   .   
 COMPSAC 2023 will be in-person at the University of Torino. Authors who are not able to attend in-person will have their video presentations made available for dissemination through IEEE. All registrants will be provided with instructions on how to download, at their own convenience, the online papers and their associated videos .   
  Programs are posted  on the respective symposia and workshop program pages. The comprehensive in-person program is available here  . Please note that these are draft versions and subject to change until proceedings production is complete.
