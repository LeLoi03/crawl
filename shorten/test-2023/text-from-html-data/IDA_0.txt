 Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA 2023)  
  IDA 2023 will take place at UCLouvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, 12-14 April 2023.  
  Advancing Intelligent Data Analysis  requires novel, potentially game-changing ideas. IDA’s mission is to promote ideas over performance: a solid motivation can be as convincing as exhaustive empirical evaluation. Therefore IDA accepts all inspiring papers for both presentation and publication. In order to create an open atmosphere that encourages discussion, the IDA symposium is intentionally small-scale and single-track.  
 The program of the symposium is now available: Full Program  .  
 Early registration is possible till March 25, 2023.
