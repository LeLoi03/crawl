 Workshop #1: The Principle and practice of data and Knowledge Acquisition Workshop (PKAW 2023)  
 Introduction:  This workshop intends to provide a chance for intensive discussion on knowledge acquisition and data engineering with theoretical aspects as well as their implementations. In this era of entering the practical use of AI, unprecedented evolutions are expected to emerge in many industries and society. AI is changing the way in which organizations execute their business processes and provide their products or services. Also, in our daily life, AI-embedded devices such as smart speakers are about to become widely used, which extends the possibility of acquiring knowledge from users' behavior observed through the interaction between those devices and their users. With this perspective, this workshop focuses on multidisciplinary research, including knowledge engineering, machine learning, natural language processing, and human-computer interaction. Also, the research on the implementation, such as applications, and data platforms, including their industrial/social impacts, are the focus of the workshop. In engineering and social science fields (e.g., economics, social networks, and sociology), recent progress in knowledge acquisition and data engineering techniques is realizing interesting applications.  
 Organizers:  Shiqing Wu, Wenli Yang and Muhammad Bilal Amin  
 Workshop #2: The 2nd Symposium on Artificial Intelligence for the Environment (AI4Environment)  
 Introduction:  As Artificial Intelligence (AI) drives changes to enhance productivity and prolong lifespans, a dual concern is the environmental sustainability of scarce planetary resources. Effective management of environmental assets and reducing our impact on sensitive ecosystems are becoming critical issues. AI has the potential to accelerate global efforts to protect the environment and conserve resources through renewable energy systems, driving energy emission reductions, CO2 removal, developing greener transportation networks, monitoring deforestation, and planning for extreme weather conditions. This workshop aims to explore the emerging applications of AI as it relates to environmental conservation and management. The first successful run of the symposium was held in Australasian Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence in 2022. This year, we would like to take to the regional level. As we know many countries in the pacific rim region are facing environmental challenges. We hope to attract researchers from these countries.  
 Organizers:  Jarrod Trevathan, M A Hakim Newton and Ashfaqur Rahman

 Workshop #3: The Pacific-Rim International Workshop on Applied Knowledge Graphs (PRIWAKG-2023)  
 Introduction:  The goal of this workshop is to facilitate practitioners in sharing their experiences, best practice, challenges and success/failure stories. Focus is on "Applied" Knowledge Graphs. This means all the presentation/demo will be on applied knowledge graphs work in Government, Industry, Non-Profit-Organisation, etc. The PRIWAKG Organising Committee invites you to actively contribute to the workshop by submitting an abstract for consideration and inclusion in the programme of the PRIWAKG-2023.  
 Organizers:  Prasad Yalamanchi and Dickson Lukose  
 Workshop #4: The 3rd International Workshop on Democracy and AI (DemocrAI2023 Winter)  
 Introduction:  This workshop will explore how AI research can contribute to solving challenging problems by current-day communities. For example, what role can AI play in promoting conversational democracy? Specifically, this workshop studies literature in three distinct areas: (i) the impact of AI on democracy as a meaningful conversation; (ii) the importance of automated facilitation and decision-making methodologies and tools in social platforms; and (iii) the importance of experiments in democracy and its social impact. This workshop will bring together multidisciplinary researchers across AI and Social research and application domains. The objective is to share the current state of research and practice, explore emerging directions, and create opportunities across different strands of AI and Social research for collaboration. This workshop complements the objectives of the main conference by providing a forum for researchers, practitioners, educators and users in AI and such as those working in the areas of innovative and impactful real-world applications for social and democracy good.  
 Organizers:  Takayuki Ito, Jawad Haqbeen, Shun Okuhara and Shiyao Ding
