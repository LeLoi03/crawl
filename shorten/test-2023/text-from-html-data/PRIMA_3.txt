 I am a Senior Lecturer  and also the Associate Head International  of the School of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, University of Adelaide  . My main research focus is algorithmic game theory  and its application to cyber security  . I am also interested in combinatorial optimisation  via neural networks  and evolutionary computation  . Prior to joining the school, I was a Lecturer in the Economics and Computation group at the University of Liverpool  , UK. I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science  from Duke University  , USA. My Ph.D. Dissertation was recognised as the runner-up for the Victor Lessor Distinguished Dissertation Award  (annual best Ph.D. Dissertation award for the field of multiagent systems worldwide). I hold a M.S. degree in Applied Mathematics  from University of Florida  , USA and a B.S. degree in Mathematics  from Zhejiang University  , China.  
  I have over 20 publications as lead author  in CORE A* venues such as AAAI/IJCAI/AAMAS and have served on the senior program committees of all the above conferences. Since 2022, I have led/participated in 8 research projects funded by industry partners including Cybersecurity CRC and DSTG (combined actual/projected income over 1.5 million). I currently supervise 7 active HDR students. My recent Ph.D. graduate Dr. Guanhua Wang (2022) received Dean's Commendation for Doctoral Thesis Excellence.
