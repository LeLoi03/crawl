 28th International Conference of the Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia  
 Human-Centric  
 Computational design, simulation, analysis, fabrication, and management allow us to evaluate and forecast the performance of habitats with a deeper understanding of contexts.  
 Technology for social good is an agenda to articulate values, behaviours, and attitudes that focus on social impact – placing people at the focal point. In the context of a rapidly changing climate, it is has become evident that we are approaching a moment of no return; a moment in which our fate hangs in the balance. We as a species, and the societies we construct, must take immediate action and work collectively towards a brighter and more sustainable future.  
 CAADRIA2023 calls in particular for contributions addressing the conference theme by discussing the influence of technology on society, economy, environment, and governance pertaining to habitats where people are at the heart of the construction industry. We invite conversations and debate around key questions:  
 How do different computational design approaches contribute to the design, development and policy making of complex societies?  
 To what extent automation, machine intelligence and control of complex systems impact societal development?  
 How does the practical and real-world applications of computational research and technologies advance broader social well-being?  
 The 28th Annual Conference for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA) brings together academics, researchers, and practitioners to contribute to the fields of computational design methods, instruments, and processes to innovate for humans. Contributions focusing on the Asia/Pacific context are be particularly encouraged.
