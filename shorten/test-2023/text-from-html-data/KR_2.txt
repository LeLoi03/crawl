 20th International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR2023)  
  September 2, 2023 – September 8, 2023  
   Rhodes, Greece  
 Abstract  
 Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR) is a well-established and lively field of research. In KR a fundamental assumption is that an agent’s knowledge is explicitly represented in a declarative form, suitable for processing by dedicated reasoning engines. This assumption, that much of what an agent deals with is knowledge-based, is common in many modern intelligent systems. Consequently, KR has contributed to the theory and practice of various areas in AI, including automated planning and natural language understanding, and to fields beyond AI, including databases, verification, software engineering, and robotics. In recent years, KR has contributed also to new and emerging fields, including the semantic web, computational biology, cyber security, and the development of software agents.
