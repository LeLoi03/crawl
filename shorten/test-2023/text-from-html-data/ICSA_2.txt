 ICSA  
 The International Conference on Software Architecture (ICSA) is the premier venue for practitioners and researchers interested in software architecture, in component-based software engineering and in quality aspects of software and how these relate to the design of software architectures. ICSA has a strong tradition as a working conference (previously named Working International Conference on Software Architecture, WICSA), where researchers meet practitioners and software architects can explain the problems they face in their day-to-day work and try to influence the future of the field.  
 On this web site you can find information about the ICSA conference series as well as useful information for organizing a future ICSA conference. We also provide information about the history of ICSA and its predecessor conferences, WICSA, CBSE, and QoSA,  on awards for most influential papers of past instances of ICSA  and a hall of fame of past best papers and best reviewers.
