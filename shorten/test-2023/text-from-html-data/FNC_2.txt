 Mobile Systems and Pervasive Computing (MobiSPC) have evolved into an active area of research and development. This is due to the tremendous advances in a broad spectrum of technologies and topics, including wireless networking, mobile and distributed computing, sensor systems, RFID technology, and the ubiquitous mobile phone. MobiSPC-2023 solicits papers that focus on the theory, systems, practices and challenges of providing users with a successful mobile or wireless experience. This includes how mobile computing changes how people pervasively use their computers, computing resources and applications, as well the systems, services and technology enabling those applications.  
 MobiSPC 2023 will provide a leading edge, scholarly forum for researchers, engineers, and students alike to share their state-of-the art research and developmental work in the broad areas of pervasive computing and communications. The MobiSPC-2023 will be held in conjunction with The 18th International Conference on Future Networks and Communications (FNC 2023).
