 Venue: Amrita University, Mysore  
 Call for Technical Research Papers, Student Project Showcase & TechnoBizPlan Showcase Proposals, and Industry Advancement Demos  
 Overview  
 The Twelfth edition of the IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing in Emerging Markets (CCEM) offers an ideal platform for innovators researchers and students on Cloud computing and its associated technology areas and applications - these have emerged as a dominant and transformational paradigm influencing many institutions and industry-sectors such as Health Governance, Banking Finance, Telecommunications, Education, Retail, Energy Utilities, and Transportation. Innovations in this spans a number of areas including virtualization networking, storage, security, management of cloud services – hybrid & on-premise, efficient interoperable cloud architectures as well as design of cloud applications and services. This transformation has great implications for emerging markets & Nations, in their adoption of cloud computing, combine cloud computing social media and mobile technologies to introduce unique services that can transform the lives of billions, drive much larger scale of adoption & challenge existing price points, while presenting unique challenges in areas such as security, data privacy and user interfaces to cloud computing. This highly focused IEEE CCEM-2023 is targeted at potential participants planning to submit their research papers techno-business plan showcase (with VC Elevator pitch Competition) or student-project-showcase (with proof-of-concepts competition). We encourage proposal submissions for innovative cloud-based-systems in the world of BigData, AI ML/DL & IoT that address emerging market problems as well as solutions from it for the World. The conference participants, if selected based on their submission, get an opportunity to present their ideas and obtain professional feedback as well as mentoring in an encouraging and nurturing environment. Certificates and cash awards will be given for the three most innovative proposals submitted across these three areas viz., (1) Research-paper (2) Student- Project Showcase and Technobiz-plan Showcase.  
 Topics of Interest in this Conference include Technologies & applications with Cloud/Big Data/AI/Deep Learning/IoT, both for & from Emerging Markets:  
 Design of Cloud Computing services, especially for emerging markets – infrastructure, platform database, software, network, storage, e-governance, and business process. 
  Utilizing/enhancing the Cloud for Big data & Predictive analytics. 
  Affordable Security and Privacy of data in the cloud, sensor networks and IoT.
