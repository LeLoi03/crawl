 Welcome!  
 The Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education is organized by the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE)  and is the organizationâ€™s flagship conference. The SIGCSE Technical Symposium addresses problems common among educators working to develop, implement and/or evaluate computing programs, curricula, and courses. The symposium provides a forum for sharing new ideas for syllabi, laboratories, and other elements of teaching and pedagogy, at all levels of instruction. The symposium provides a diverse selection of technical sessions and opportunities for learning and interaction.  
 SIGCSE TS 2023 will be held from March 15 - 18, 2023. The conference is hybrid with both online and in-person attendance options. All in-person sessions will take place in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
