 LAK23 Planning  
 As SoLAR and conference organizers announced on May 5, 2022, LAK23 will now take place in Arlington, Texas, USA to ensure that a face-to-face event can take place. Please see the full announcement for full details on the reasoning behind this change. Hybrid options will be available and more information will be forthcoming as the planning process continues. Please check back here regularly for updates and be sure to follow us on social media and sign up for the SoLAR newsletter  to receive the latest information from the learning analytics community.
