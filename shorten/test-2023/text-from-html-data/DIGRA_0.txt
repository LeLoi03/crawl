  seville 2023  
 This new edition will take place on 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 June 2023 in Seville, Spain  , under the theme Limits and Margins of Games  .  
 The organizing committee of the DiGRA 2023 conference is particularly interested in exploring the limits and margins of games.  
 The video game taxon seems insufficient today to describe the theoretical and practical nature linked to this means of expression.  
 As a result of these concerns, and with the aim of building an international framework for a dialogue about them, we proposed the Limits and Margins of Games as the central theme to this yearâ€™s edition.  
 We hope to be able to offer you an experience on a par with previous editions and a unique meeting point in the south of Europe.  
 Welcome to DiGRA 2023!
