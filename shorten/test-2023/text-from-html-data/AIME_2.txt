  Updates on Twitter @AIMEconference  
 Contributions to theory and methods should present or analyse novel AI theories or methodologies for solving problems in the biomedical field. They may propose new theories and methods or extensions of existing ones. In both cases, the work should demonstrate its utility for solving biomedical problems and highlight its contribution to the underlying theoretical basis. In addition, it should discuss assumptions, limitations, and novelty with respect to the state of the art.  
 Contributions addressing systems and applications should describe the development, implementation or evaluation of innovative, AI-based tools and systems in the biomedical application domain. These papers should both link the work to underlying theory and either analyse the potential benefits to solve biomedical problems or present empirical evidence of benefits in clinical practice.  
 AWARDS
