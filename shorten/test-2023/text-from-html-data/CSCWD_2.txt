 May. 24 - 26, 2023  
 Rio de Janeiro · Brazil  
 Introduction  
 Design of complex artifacts and systems requires the cooperation of multidisciplinary design teams. The 2023 26th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design (CSCWD 2023) provides a forum for researchers and practitioners involved in different but related domains to confront research results and discuss key problems. The scope of CSCWD 2023 includes the research and development of collaboration technologies and their applications to the design of processes, products, systems, and services in industries and societies. Collaboration technologies include theories, methods, mechanisms, protocols, software tools, platforms, and services that support communication, coordination and collaboration among people, software and hardware systems. Related fields of research include human-computer interaction, business process management, collaborative virtual environments, enterprise modeling, security and privacy, as well as social aspects and human factors related to collaboration and design.
