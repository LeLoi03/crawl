  Welcome to the ICMLA'23 Official Web Site     
  ICMLA'23 aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to present their latest achievements and innovations in the area of machine learning (ML).  
 The conference provides a leading international forum for the dissemination of original research in ML, with emphasis on applications as well as novel algorithms and systems. Following the success of previous ICMLA conferences, the conference aims to attract researchers and application developers from a wide range of ML related areas, and the recent emergence of Big Data processing brings an urgent need for machine learning to address these new challenges. The conference will cover both machine learning theoretical research and its applications. Contributions describing machine learning techniques applied to real-world problems and interdisciplinary research involving machine learning, in fields like medicine, biology, industry, manufacturing, security, education, virtual environments, games, are especially encouraged.  
 Accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xploreâ€™s scope and quality requirements. The conference is technically co-sponsored by IEEE.  
 It is planned that ICMLA'23 will be organized as in pre-pandemics time, with participants attending the conference in person, unless Covid rules will change towards the end of the year and this will not be possible. However, facilities will be in place so that people can attend and present their papers online, although we encourage in-person attendance.
