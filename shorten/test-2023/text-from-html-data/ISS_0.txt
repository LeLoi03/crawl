  DOI 
 The award is given to a paper that has had a significant impact on the ISS community, the broader human-computer interaction community, or the industry. The jury evaluated papers from a number of perspectives, like citations and how they developed over time, which venues and what kinds of papers were citing the work, and the extent of forward-thinking ideas, concepts, or prototypes that would later be adopted widely.  
 Roman Rädle (middle) attended the conference in person to receive the award from ISS 2023 Papers Co-Chairs, Ville Mäkelä (left) and Andrés Lucero (right).
