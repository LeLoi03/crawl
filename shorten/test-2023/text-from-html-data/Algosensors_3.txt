 General information   
 ALGO is an annual meeting combining the premier algorithmic conference European Symposium on Algorithms  (ESA)  and a number of other specialized conferences and workshops, all related to algorithms and their applications, making ALGO the major European event for researchers, students and practitioners in algorithms.  
 ALGO 2023 will be held at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI)   in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, which will also organize the conference.  
 Amsterdam is a very busy city and rather expensive. We advise to reserve a hotel room as soon as possible. There are still some rooms available  at Hotel Casa Amsterdam  .
