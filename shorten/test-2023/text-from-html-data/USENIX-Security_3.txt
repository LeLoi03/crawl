 Important:  In 2023, we are introducing substantial changes to the review process, aimed to provide a more consistent path towards acceptance and reduce the number of times papers reenter the reviewing process. Detailed information is available at USENIX Security Publication Model Changes  .   
 All researchers are encouraged to submit papers covering novel and scientifically significant practical works in computer security.

 Symposium Topics  
 Refereed paper submissions are solicited in all areas relating to systems research in security and privacy. This topic list is not meant to be exhaustive; USENIX Security is interested in all aspects of computing systems security and privacy. Papers without a clear application to security or privacy of computing systems, however, will be considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review.

 Refereed Papers  
 Papers that have been formally reviewed and accepted will be presented during the Symposium and published in the Symposium Proceedings. By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it. Alternative arrangements will be made if global health concerns persist. If the conference registration fee will pose a hardship for the presenter of the accepted paper, please contact conference@usenix.org  .  
 A major mission of the USENIX Association is to provide for the creation and dissemination of new knowledge. In keeping with this and as part of USENIX's open access policy, the Proceedings will be available online for registered attendees before the Symposium and for everyone starting on the opening day of the technical sessions. USENIX also allows authors to retain ownership of the copyright in their works, requesting only that USENIX be granted the right to be the first publisher of that work. See our sample consent form  for the complete terms of publication.

 Poster Session  
 Birds-of-a-Feather Sessions (BoFs)  
 Birds-of-a-Feather sessions (BoFs) will be held Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday evenings. Birds-of-a-Feather sessions are informal gatherings of persons interested in a particular topic. BoFs often feature a presentation or a demonstration followed by discussion, announcements, and the sharing of strategies. BoFs can be scheduled on-site or in advance. To schedule a BoF, please send an email to the USENIX Conference Department at bofs@usenix.org  with the title and a brief description of the BoF; the name, title, affiliation, and email address of the facilitator; and your preference of date and time.
