 General information  
 CIDR 2022 was a hybrid event held physically in Chaminade with remote participation through Zoom. We wrote a report on our setup and experiences  .   
 The CIDR program consists of single-track keynote, paper and demo presentations. CIDR encourages papers about innovative and risky data management system architecture ideas, systems-building experience and insight, resourceful experimental studies, and provocative position statements. Papers are encouraged to present novel approaches to data systems architecture and usage, to inspire discussions on the latest innovative and visionary ideas in the field. Authors are encouraged to submit their best systems work, and are limited to submit at most two papers.  
 Please check the Call for Papers  for more information on important dates and submission guidelines.
