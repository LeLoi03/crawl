     T  o MC  hallenges: A Principle-Guided Dataset and Diverse Evaluation Tasks for Exploring Theory of Mind    
  Xiaomeng Ma  | Lingyu Gao  | Qihui Xu    
 Theory of Mind (ToM), the capacity to comprehend the mental states of distinct individuals, is essential for numerous practical applications. With the development of large language models (LLMs), there is a heated debate about whether they are able to perform ToM tasks. Previous studies have used different tasks and prompts to test the ToM on LLMs and the results are inconsistent: some studies asserted these models are capable of exhibiting ToM, while others suggest the opposite. In this study, We present ToMChallenges, a dataset for comprehensively evaluating the Theory of Mind based on Sally-Anne and Smarties tests with a diverse set of tasks. In addition, we also propose an auto-grader to streamline the answer evaluation process. We tested three models: davinci, turbo, and gpt-4. Our evaluation results and error analyses show that LLMs have inconsistent behaviors across prompts and tasks. Performing the ToM tasks robustly remains a challenge for the LLMs. In addition, our paper wants to raise awareness in evaluating the ToM in LLMs and we want to invite more discussion on how to design the prompts and tasks for ToM tasks that can better access the LLMs‚Äô ability.

     A  rch BERT  : Bi-Modal Understanding of Neural Architectures and Natural Languages    
  Mohammad Akbari  | Saeed Ranjbar Alvar  | Behnam Kamranian  | Amin Banitalebi-Dehkordi  | Yong Zhang    
 Building multi-modal language models has been a trend in the recent years, where additional modalities such as image, video, speech, etc. are jointly learned along with natural languages (i.e., textual information). Despite the success of these multi-modal language models with different modalities, there is no existing solution for neural network architectures and natural languages. Providing neural architectural information as a new modality allows us to provide fast architecture-2-text and text-2-architecture retrieval/generation services on the cloud with a single inference. Such solution is valuable in terms of helping beginner and intermediate ML users to come up with better neural architectures or AutoML approaches with a simple text query. In this paper, we propose ArchBERT, a bi-modal model for joint learning and understanding of neural architectures and natural languages, which opens up new avenues for research in this area. We also introduce a pre-training strategy named Masked Architecture Modeling (MAM) for a more generalized joint learning. Moreover, we introduce and publicly release two new bi-modal datasets for training and validating our methods. The ArchBERT‚Äôs performance is verified through a set of numerical experiments on different downstream tasks such as architecture-oriented reasoning, question answering, and captioning (summarization). Datasets, codes, and demos are available as supplementary materials.

   A Comparative Study on Textual Saliency of Styles from Eye Tracking, Annotations, and Language Models    
  Karin de Langis  | Dongyeop Kang    
 There is growing interest in incorporating eye-tracking data and other implicit measures of human language processing into natural language processing (NLP) pipelines. The data from human language processing contain unique insight into human linguistic understanding that could be exploited by language models. However, many unanswered questions remain about the nature of this data and how it can best be utilized in downstream NLP tasks. In this paper, we present EyeStyliency, an eye-tracking dataset for human processing of stylistic text (e.g., politeness). We develop an experimental protocol to collect these style-specific eye movements. We further investigate how this saliency data compares to both human annotation methods and model-based interpretability metrics. We find that while eye-tracking data is unique, it also intersects with both human annotations and model-based importance scores, providing a possible bridge between human- and machine-based perspectives. We propose utilizing this type of data to evaluate the cognitive plausibility of models that interpret style. Our eye-tracking data and processing code are publicly available.

   PROPRES  : Investigating the Projectivity of Presupposition with Various Triggers and Environments    
  Daiki Asami  | Saku Sugawara    
 What makes a presupposition of an utterance ‚Äîinformation taken for granted by its speaker‚Äî different from other pragmatic inferences such as an entailment is projectivity (e.g., the negative sentence the boy did not stop shedding tears presupposes the boy had shed tears before). The projectivity may vary depending on the combination of presupposition triggers and environments. However, prior natural language understanding studies fail to take it into account as they either use no human baseline or include only negation as an entailment-canceling environment to evaluate models‚Äô performance. The current study attempts to reconcile these issues. We introduce a new dataset, projectivity of presupposition (PROPRES), which includes 12k premise‚Äìhypothesis pairs crossing six triggers involving some lexical variety with five environments. Our human evaluation reveals that humans exhibit variable projectivity in some cases. However, the model evaluation shows that the best-performed model, DeBERTa, does not fully capture it. Our findings suggest that probing studies on pragmatic inferences should take extra care of the human judgment variability and the combination of linguistic items.

   A Minimal Approach for Natural Language Action Space in Text-based Games    
  Dongwon Ryu  | Meng Fang  | Gholamreza Haffari  | Shirui Pan  | Ehsan Shareghi    
 Text-based games (TGs) are language-based interactive environments for reinforcement learning. While language models (LMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs) are commonly used for handling large action space in TGs, it is unclear whether these techniques are necessary or overused. In this paper, we revisit the challenge of exploring the action space in TGs and propose ùúñ  -admissible exploration, a minimal approach of utilizing admissible actions, for training phase. Additionally, we present a text-based actor-critic (TAC) agent that produces textual commands for game, solely from game observations, without requiring any KG or LM. Our method, on average across 10 games from Jericho, outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art agents that use LM and KG. Our approach highlights that a much lighter model design, with a fresh perspective on utilizing the information within the environments, suffices for an effective exploration of exponentially large action spaces.

   Structural Ambiguity and its Disambiguation in Language Model Based Parsers: the Case of D  utch Clause Relativization    
  Gijs Wijnholds  | Michael Moortgat    
 This paper addresses structural ambiguity in Dutch relative clauses. By investigating the task of disambiguation by grounding, we study how the presence of a prior sentence can resolve relative clause ambiguities. We apply this method to two parsing architectures in an attempt to demystify the parsing and language model components of two present-day neural parsers. Results show that a neurosymbolic parser, based on proof nets, is more open to data bias correction than an approach based on universal dependencies, although both set-ups suffer from a comparable initial data bias.

       Quantifying Information of Tokens for Simple and Flexible Simultaneous Machine Translation    
  DongHyun Lee  | Minkyung Park  | Byung-Jun Lee    
 Simultaneous Translation (ST) involves translating with only partial source inputs instead of the entire source inputs, a process that can potentially result in translation quality degradation. Previous approaches to balancing translation quality and latency have demonstrated that it is more efficient and effective to leverage an offline model with a reasonable policy. However, using an offline model also leads to a distribution shift since it is not trained with partial source inputs, and it can be improved by training an additional module that informs us when to translate. In this paper, we propose an Information Quantifier (IQ) that models source and target information to determine whether the offline model has sufficient information for translation, trained with oracle action sequences generated from the offline model. IQ, by quantifying information, helps in formulating a suitable policy for Simultaneous Translation that better generalizes and also allows us to control the trade-off between quality and latency naturally. Experiments on various language pairs show that our proposed model outperforms baselines.

   Enhancing Code-mixed Text Generation Using Synthetic Data Filtering in Neural Machine Translation    
  Dama Sravani  | Radhika Mamidi    
 Code-Mixing, the act of mixing two or more languages, is a common communicative phenomenon in multi-lingual societies. The lack of quality in code-mixed data is a bottleneck for NLP systems. On the other hand, Monolingual systems perform well due to ample high-quality data. To bridge the gap, creating coherent translations of monolingual sentences to their code-mixed counterparts can improve accuracy in code-mixed settings for NLP downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a neural machine translation approach to generate high-quality code-mixed sentences by leveraging human judgements. We train filters based on human judgements to identify natural code-mixed sentences from a larger synthetically generated code-mixed corpus, resulting in a three-way silver parallel corpus between monolingual English, monolingual Indian language and code-mixed English with an Indian language. Using these corpora, we fine-tune multi-lingual encoder-decoder models viz, mT5 and mBART, for the translation task. Our results indicate that our approach of using filtered data for training outperforms the current systems for code-mixed generation in Hindi-English. Apart from Hindi-English, the approach performs well when applied to Telugu, a low-resource language, to generate Telugu-English code-mixed sentences.

     The Validity of Evaluation Results: Assessing Concurrence Across Compositionality Benchmarks    
  Kaiser Sun  | Adina Williams  | Dieuwke Hupkes    
 NLP models have progressed drastically in recent years, according to numerous datasets proposed to evaluate performance. Questions remain, however, about how particular dataset design choices may impact the conclusions we draw about model capabilities. In this work, we investigate this question in the domain of compositional generalization. We examine the performance of six modeling approaches across 4 datasets, split according to 8 compositional splitting strategies, ranking models by 18 compositional generalization splits in total. Our results show that: i) the datasets, although all designed to evaluate compositional generalization, rank modeling approaches differently; ii) datasets generated by humans align better with each other than with synthetic datasets, or than the latter among themselves; iii) generally, whether datasets are sampled from the same source is more predictive of the resulting model ranking than whether they maintain the same interpretation of compositionality; and iv) specific lexical items in dataset impacts the measurement consistency. Overall, our results demonstrate that much work remains to be done when it comes to assessing whether popular evaluation datasets measure what they intend to measure, and suggests that elucidating more rigorous standards for establishing the validity of evaluation sets could benefit the field.

   M  ed- HALT  : Medical Domain Hallucination Test for Large Language Models    
  Ankit Pal  | Logesh Kumar Umapathi  | Malaikannan Sankarasubbu    
 This research paper focuses on the challenges posed by hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), particularly in the context of the medical domain. Hallucination, wherein these models generate plausible yet unverified or incorrect information, can have serious consequences in healthcare applications. We propose a new benchmark and dataset, Med-HALT (Medical Domain Hallucination Test), designed specifically to evaluate and reduce hallucinations. Med-HALT provides a diverse multinational dataset derived from medical examinations across various countries and includes multiple innovative testing modalities. Med-HALT includes two categories of tests reasoning and memory-based hallucination tests, designed to assess LLMs‚Äô problem-solving and information retrieval abilities. Our study evaluated leading LLMs, including Text Davinci, GPT-3.5, LlaMa-2, MPT, and Falcon, revealing significant differences in their performance. The paper provides detailed insights into the dataset, promoting transparency and reproducibility. Through this work, we aim to contribute to the development of safer and more reliable language models in healthcare. Our benchmark can be found at medhalt.github.io

     HNC  : Leveraging Hard Negative Captions towards Models with Fine-Grained Visual-Linguistic Comprehension Capabilities    
  Esra D√∂nmez  | Pascal Tilli  | Hsiu-Yu Yang  | Ngoc Thang Vu  | Carina Silberer    
 Image-Text-Matching (ITM) is one of the defacto methods of learning generalized representations from a large corpus in Vision and Language (VL). However, due to the weak association between the web-collected image‚Äìtext pairs, models fail to show fine-grained understanding of the combined semantics of these modalities. To this end, we propose Hard Negative Captions (HNC): an automatically created dataset containing foiled hard negative captions for ITM training towards achieving fine-grained cross-modal comprehension in VL. Additionally, we provide a challenging manually-created test set for benchmarking models on a fine-grained cross-modal mismatch with varying levels of compositional complexity. Our results show the effectiveness of training on HNC by improving the models‚Äô zero-shot capabilities in detecting mismatches on diagnostic tasks and performing robustly under noisy visual input scenarios. Also, we demonstrate that HNC models yield a comparable or better initialization for fine-tuning. Our code and data are publicly available.

   Theory of Mind in Large Language Models: Examining Performance of 11 State-of-the-Art models vs. Children Aged 7-10 on Advanced Tests    
  Max van Duijn  | Bram van Dijk  | Tom Kouwenhoven  | Werner de Valk  | Marco Spruit  | Peter van der Putten    
 To what degree should we ascribe cognitive capacities to Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the ability to reason about intentions and beliefs known as Theory of Mind (ToM)? Here we add to this emerging debate by (i) testing 11 base- and instruction-tuned LLMs on capabilities relevant to ToM beyond the dominant false-belief paradigm, including non-literal language usage and recursive intentionality; (ii) using newly rewritten versions of standardized tests to gauge LLMs‚Äô robustness; (iii) prompting and scoring for open besides closed questions; and (iv) benchmarking LLM performance against that of children aged 7-10 on the same tasks. We find that instruction-tuned LLMs from the GPT family outperform other models, and often also children. Base-LLMs are mostly unable to solve ToM tasks, even with specialized prompting. We suggest that the interlinked evolution and development of language and ToM may help explain what instruction-tuning adds: rewarding cooperative communication that takes into account interlocutor and context. We conclude by arguing for a nuanced perspective on ToM in LLMs.

   A Block Metropolis-Hastings Sampler for Controllable Energy-based Text Generation    
  Jarad Forristal  | Fatemehsadat Mireshghallah  | Greg Durrett  | Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick    
 Recent work has shown that energy-based language modeling is an effective framework for controllable text generation because it enables flexible integration of arbitrary discriminators. However, because energy-based LMs are globally normalized, approximate techniques like Metropolis-Hastings (MH) are required for inference. Past work has largely explored simple proposal distributions that modify a single token at a time, like in Gibbs sampling. In this paper, we develop a novel MH sampler that, in contrast, proposes re-writes of the entire sequence in each step via iterative prompting of a large language model. Our new sampler (a) allows for more efficient and accurate sampling from a target distribution and (b) allows generation length to be determined through the sampling procedure rather than fixed in advance, as past work has required. We perform experiments on two controlled generation tasks, showing both downstream performance gains and more accurate target distribution sampling in comparison with single-token proposal techniques.

   Challenging the ‚ÄúOne Single Vector per Token‚Äù Assumption    
  Mathieu Dehouck    
 In this paper we question the almost universal assumption that in neural networks each token should be represented by a single vector. In fact, it is so natural to use one vector per word that most people do not even consider it as an assumption of their various models. Via a series of experiments on dependency parsing, in which we let each token in a sentence be represented by a sequence of vectors, we show that the ‚Äúone single vector per token‚Äù assumption might be too strong for recurrent neural networks. Indeed, biaffine parsers seem to work better when their encoder accesses its input‚Äôs tokens‚Äô representations in several time steps rather than all at once. This seems to indicate that having only one occasion to look at a token through its vector is too strong a constraint for recurrent neural networks and calls for further studies on the way tokens are fed to neural networks.

   Strategies to Improve Low-Resource Agglutinative Languages Morphological Inflection    
  Gulinigeer Abudouwaili  | Wayit Ablez  | Kahaerjiang Abiderexiti  | Aishan Wumaier  | Nian Yi    
 Morphological inflection is a crucial task in the field of morphology and is typically considered a sequence transduction task. In recent years, it has received substantial attention from researchers and made significant progress. Models have achieved impressive performance levels for both high- and low-resource languages. However, when the distribution of instances in the training dataset changes, or novel lemma or feature labels are predicted, the model‚Äôs accuracy declines. In agglutinative languages, morphological inflection involves phonological phenomena while generating new words, which can alter the syllable patterns at the boundary between the lemma and the suffixes. This paper proposes four strategies for low-resource agglutinative languages to enhance the model‚Äôs generalization ability. Firstly, a convolution module extracts syllable-like units from lemmas, allowing the model to learn syllable features. Secondly, the lemma and feature labels are represented separately in the input, and the position encoding of the feature labels is marked so that the model learns the order between suffixes and labels. Thirdly, the model recognizes the common substrings in lemmas through two special characters and copies them into words. Finally, combined with syllable features, we improve the data augmentation method. A series of experiments show that the proposed model in this paper is superior to other baseline models.

   Tree-shape Uncertainty for Analyzing the Inherent Branching Bias of Unsupervised Parsing Models    
  Taiga Ishii  | Yusuke Miyao    
 This paper presents the formalization of tree-shape uncertainty that enables us to analyze the inherent branching bias of unsupervised parsing models using raw texts alone. Previous work analyzed the branching bias of unsupervised parsing models by comparing the outputs of trained parsers with gold syntactic trees. However, such approaches do not consider the fact that texts can be generated by different grammars with different syntactic trees, possibly failing to clearly separate the inherent bias of the model and the bias in train data learned by the model. To this end, we formulate tree-shape uncertainty and derive sufficient conditions that can be used for creating texts that are expected to contain no biased information on branching. In the experiment, we show that training parsers on such unbiased texts can effectively detect the branching bias of existing unsupervised parsing models. Such bias may depend only on the algorithm, or it may depend on seemingly unrelated dataset statistics such as sequence length and vocabulary size.

   Cross-Document Event Coreference Resolution: Instruct Humans or Instruct GPT  ?    
  Jin Zhao  | Nianwen Xue  | Bonan Min    
 This paper explores utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform Cross-Document Event Coreference Resolution (CDEC) annotations and evaluates how they fare against human annotators with different levels of training. Specifically, we formulate CDEC as a multi-category classification problem on pairs of events that are represented as decontextualized sentences, and compare the predictions of GPT-4 with the judgment of fully trained annotators and crowdworkers on the same data set. Our study indicates that GPT-4 with zero-shot learning outperformed crowd-workers by a large margin and exhibits a level of performance comparable to trained annotators. Upon closer analysis, GPT-4 also exhibits tendencies of being overly confident, and force annotation decisions even when such decisions are not warranted due to insufficient information. Our results have implications on how to perform complicated annotations such as CDEC in the age of LLMs, and show that the best way to acquire such annotations might be to combine the strengths of LLMs and trained human annotators in the annotation process, and using untrained or undertrained crowdworkers is no longer a viable option to acquire high-quality data to advance the state of the art for such problems.
