   Welcome from the Conference Chair  
 Welcome to ICCHP 24,  
 the 19th "International Conference on Computers Helping People with Special Needs"!  
 Last ICCHP was a great successful in-person event, and it showed that Covid-19 crisis was gradually becoming a thing of the past.  
 It was indeed a pleasure to see each other and engage fruitful discussions.  
 Following that memorable event, we are delighted to announce the 19th vibrant biennial conference, returning to our home in LINZ!  
 To make ICT more accessible and tailoring assistive technology and services to promote inclusion and participation in all aspects of society.  
 Nowadays, “everyone” uses various SNS on their smartphones, often with AI-driven recommendations.  
  However, even in this cutting-edge era, or perhaps because of it, various accessibility issues still persist.  
 To address and resolve such challenges, I am confident that ICCHP is the ideal platform. Here, you can find research companions, discuss your issues, and establish a global human network even more valuable than AI.  
 We warmly invite you to participate in this remarkable conference and share your ideas. We eagerly await your contributions and presence.  
 Come and get involved, develop your network!
