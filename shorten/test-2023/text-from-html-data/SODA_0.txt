 About the Conference  
 SODA is sponsored by the SIAM Activity Group on Discrete Mathematics and the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory.  
 This symposium focuses on research topics related to design and analysis of efficient algorithms and data structures for discrete problems.  
 The scope includes theoretical analysis, as well as experimental validation, and the mathematical problems related to their development or limitations. The scope also includes aspects of combinatorics and discrete mathematics related to discrete algorithms. Papers that raise important algorithmic problems that can benefit from theoretical investigation and analysis, are encouraged.
